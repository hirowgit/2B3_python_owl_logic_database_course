BACKGROUND: Chronic gastroenteropathies, including gluten sensitivity and
marmoset wasting syndrome, frequently occur in captive colonies of common
marmosets (Callithrix jacchus). Early identification and diagnosis of affected
animals are desirable. Endoscopic examination of the colon in marmosets is
described, but the small intestine can harbor significant mucosal lesions not
representing those in the colon. Evaluating the small intestine currently
requires invasive surgical biopsies due to the small patient size, carrying a
risk of severe complications.
METHODS: Endoscopic intubation and multisite biopsy of the duodenum/proximal
jejunum are demonstrated in 10 marmosets under general anesthesia.
RESULTS: Esophagogastroduodenoscopy with colonoscopy efficiently aid in examining
the gastrointestinal tract and obtaining an antemortem histologic diagnosis in
marmosets with chronic gastrointestinal signs.
CONCLUSIONS: This minimally invasive technique is feasible in marmosets. Future
investigations into the pathogenesis of chronic gastroenteropathies will benefit 
from these data, leading to improved animal welfare and better individual and
colony health management.

A pregnant common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) showed tachypnea, hypothermia,
and anorexia at close to the expected delivery date. Severe anemia and
thrombocytopenia, schistocytes, and high levels of LDH and D-dimer were observed.
Three days after the onset of clinical signs, a cesarean section was conducted
due to stillbirth. Marmoset immediately recovered after surgery, and the abnormal
CBC and blood chemistry parameters before surgery returned to the normal ranges. 
Diagnosis of pregnancy-associated thrombotic microangiopathy was made because
removal of infant and placenta is curative. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first case report of thrombotic microangiopathy in a marmoset with
preeclampsia.

It is known that primates including human regain some locomotor function after a 
partial spinal cord injury, but the locomotor pattern is different from before
the injury. Although these observations have many implications for improving
rehabilitative strategies, these mechanisms are not well understood. In this
study, we used a common marmoset hemisection SCI model to examine temporal
changes in locomotor pattern, in particular, intersegmental coordination of left 
hindlimb. Marmoset showed loss of detectable function in the left forelimb and
hindlimb after left unilateral hemisection of cervical spinal cord. At two weeks 
after injury, weight-bearing of the left forelimb during locomotion was limited, 
but the left hindlimb was able to plantar step. Then marmosets showed gradual
recovery in walking ability, but kinematics analysis showed differences in the
endpoint trajectory and joint angle movement. Furthermore, intersegmental
coordination in left hindlimb represented by planar covariation was preserved
over time after the injury. Previous studies have reported that planar covariance
is disrupted in patients with stroke or SCI, and that improvement in planarity
correlates with recovery in walking ability after rehabilitation. In this study, 
quadrupedal marmosets were able to walk without loss of balance even after SCI;
the different balance needs of bipedal and quadrupedal walkers may lead to
differences in planar covariation. Our results show that planar covariation was
preserved at all time points after the cervical unilateral hemisection.

BACKGROUND: The common marmoset is widely used in current biomedical research for
various research fields. We observed macrocytic anemia in a perinatal common
marmoset with gradual weight loss and diarrhea. The objective of this case report
is to describe the diagnosis and treatment of macrocytic anemia in a perinatal
common marmoset.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 7-year-old female common marmoset showed clinical signs of
gradual weight loss and intermittent diarrhea beginning 3 months after giving
birth. Macrocytic anemia was diagnosed due to a decreased red blood cell (RBC)
count, low hemoglobin level, and increased mean corpuscular volume (MCV).
Multivitamins containing cobalamin and folate were administered for 7 days, and
the patient's RBC count recovered to near the normal range with this treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Macrocytic anemia can be diagnosed by evaluating the MCV on a
complete blood count (CBC) and cobalamin or folate levels and be treated by
supplementation with cobalamin and folate. Such supplements may be needed during 
pregnancy and lactation in female common marmosets and/or in animals with chronic
diarrhea.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is quickly gaining traction as a premier
neuroscientific model. However, considerable progress is still needed in
understanding the functional and structural organization of the marmoset brain to
rival that documented in longstanding preclinical model species, like mice, rats,
and Old World primates. To accelerate such progress, we present the Marmoset
Functional Brain Connectivity Resource (marmosetbrainconnectome.org), currently
consisting of over 70 h of resting-state fMRI (RS-fMRI) data acquired at 500 µm
isotropic resolution from 31 fully awake marmosets in a common stereotactic
space. Three-dimensional functional connectivity (FC) maps for every cortical and
subcortical gray matter voxel are stored online. Users can instantaneously view, 
manipulate, and download any whole-brain functional connectivity (FC) topology
(at the subject- or group-level) along with the raw datasets and preprocessing
code. Importantly, researchers can use this resource to test hypotheses about FC 
directly - with no additional analyses required - yielding whole-brain
correlations for any gray matter voxel on demand. We demonstrate the resource's
utility for presurgical planning and comparison with tracer-based neuronal
connectivity as proof of concept. Complementing existing structural connectivity 
resources for the marmoset brain, the Marmoset Functional Brain Connectivity
Resource affords users the distinct advantage of exploring the connectivity of
any voxel in the marmoset brain, not limited to injection sites nor constrained
by regional atlases. With the entire raw database (RS-fMRI and structural images)
and preprocessing code openly available for download and use, we expect this
resource to be broadly valuable to test novel hypotheses about the functional
organization of the marmoset brain.

Neurons.

The striatum is one of the key nuclei for adequate control of voluntary behaviors
and reinforcement learning. Two striatal projection neuron types, expressing
either dopamine receptor D1 (D1R) or dopamine receptor D2 (D2R) constitute two
independent output routes: the direct or indirect pathways, respectively. These
pathways co-work in balance to achieve coordinated behavior. Two projection
neuron types are equivalently intermingled in most striatal space. However,
recent studies revealed two atypical zones in the caudal striatum: the zone in
which D1R-neurons are the minor population (D1R-poor zone) and that in which
D2R-neurons are the minority (D2R-poor zone). It remains obscure as to whether
these imbalanced zones have similar properties on axonal projections and
electrophysiology compared to other striatal regions. Based on morphological
experiments in mice using immunofluorescence, in situ hybridization, and neural
tracing, here, we revealed that the poor zones densely projected to the globus
pallidus and substantia nigra pars lateralis, with a few collaterals in
substantia nigra pars reticulata and compacta. Similar to that in other striatal 
regions, D1R-neurons were the direct pathway neurons. We also showed that the
membrane properties of projection neurons in the poor zones were largely similar 
to those in the conventional striatum using in vitro electrophysiological
recording. In addition, the poor zones existed irrespective of the age or sex of 
mice. We also identified the poor zones in the common marmoset as well as other
rodents. These results suggest that the poor zones in the caudal striatum follow 
the conventional projection patterns irrespective of the imbalanced distribution 
of projection neurons. The poor zones could be an innate structure and common in 
mammals. The unique striatal zones possessing highly restricted projections could
relate to functions different from those of motor-related striatum.

A previous study assessing the efficiency of the genome editing technology
CRISPR-Cas9 for knock-in gene targeting in common marmoset (marmoset; Callithrix 
jacchus) embryonic stem cells (ESCs) unexpectedly identified innately enhanced
homologous recombination activity in marmoset ESCs. Here, we compared gene
expression in marmoset and human pluripotent stem cells using transcriptomic and 
quantitative PCR analyses and found that five HR-related genes (BRCA1, BRCA2,
RAD51C, RAD51D, and RAD51) were upregulated in marmoset cells. A total of four of
these upregulated genes enhanced HR efficiency with CRISPR-Cas9 in human
pluripotent stem cells. Thus, the present study provides a novel insight into
species-specific mechanisms for the choice of DNA repair pathways.

Epilepsy has been extensively studied as a common neurological disease. Efforts
have been made on rodent and other animal models to reveal the pathogenic
mechanisms of epilepsy and develop new drugs for treatment. However, the features
of current epilepsy models cannot fully mimic different types of epilepsy in
humans, hence non-human primate models of epilepsy are required. The common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a New World monkey that is widely used to study 
brain function. Here, we present a natural marmoset model of generalized
epilepsy. In this unique marmoset family, generalized epilepsy was successfully
induced by handling operations in some individuals. We mapped the marmoset family
with handling-sensitive epilepsy and found that the epileptic phenotype can be
inherited. These marmosets were more sensitive to the epilepsy inducers
pentylenetetrazol. Using electrocorticogram (ECoG) recordings, we detected
epileptiform discharge in marmosets with a history of seizures. In summary, we
report a family of marmosets with generalized seizures induced by handling
operations. This epileptic marmoset family provides insights to better understand
the mechanism of generalized epilepsy and helps to develop new therapeutic
methods.

Localising accurate brain regions needs careful evaluation in each experimental
species due to their individual variability. However, the function and
connectivity of brain areas is commonly studied using a single-subject cranial
landmark-based stereotactic atlas in animal neuroscience. Here, we address this
issue in a small primate, the common marmoset, which is increasingly widely used 
in systems neuroscience. We developed a non-invasive multi-modal
neuroimaging-based targeting pipeline, which accounts for intersubject anatomical
variability in cranial and cortical landmarks in marmosets. This methodology
allowed creation of multi-modal templates (MarmosetRIKEN20) including head CT and
brain MR images, embedded in coordinate systems of anterior and posterior
commissures (AC-PC) and CIFTI grayordinates. We found that the horizontal plane
of the stereotactic coordinate was significantly rotated in pitch relative to the
AC-PC coordinate system (10 degrees, frontal downwards), and had a significant
bias and uncertainty due to positioning procedures. We also found that many
common cranial and brain landmarks (e.g., bregma, intraparietal sulcus) vary in
location across subjects and are substantial relative to average marmoset
cortical area dimensions. Combining the neuroimaging-based targeting pipeline
with robot-guided surgery enabled proof-of-concept targeting of deep brain
structures with an accuracy of 0.2 mm. Altogether, our findings demonstrate
substantial intersubject variability in marmoset brain and cranial landmarks,
implying that subject-specific neuroimaging-based localization is needed for
precision targeting in marmosets. The population-based templates and atlases in
grayordinates, created for the first time in marmoset monkeys, should help
bridging between macroscale and microscale analyses.

Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne arbovirus that can cause severe congenital 
birth defects. The utmost goal of ZIKV vaccines is to prevent both maternal-fetal
infection and congenital Zika syndrome. A Zika purified inactivated virus (ZPIV) 
was previously shown to be protective in non-pregnant mice and rhesus macaques.
In this study, we further examined the efficacy of ZPIV against ZIKV infection
during pregnancy in immunocompetent C57BL6 mice and common marmoset monkeys
(Callithrix jacchus). We showed that, in C57BL/6 mice, ZPIV significantly reduced
ZIKV-induced fetal malformations. Protection of fetuses was positively correlated
with virus-neutralizing antibody levels. In marmosets, the vaccine prevented
vertical transmission of ZIKV and elicited neutralizing antibodies that remained 
above a previously determined threshold of protection for up to 18 months. These 
proof-of-concept studies demonstrate ZPIV's protective efficacy is both potent
and durable and has the potential to prevent the harmful consequence of ZIKV
infection during pregnancy.

An increase in number of neurons is presumed to underlie the enhancement of
cognitive abilities in brain evolution. The evolution of human cognition is then 
expected to have accompanied a prolongation of net neural-processing time due to 
the accumulation of processing time of individual neurons over an expanded number
of neurons. Here, we confirmed this prediction and quantified the amount of
prolongation in vivo, using noninvasive measurements of brain responses to sounds
in unanesthetized human and nonhuman primates. Latencies of the N1 component of
auditory-evoked potentials recorded from the scalp were approximately 40, 50, 60,
and 100 ms for the common marmoset, rhesus monkey, chimpanzee, and human,
respectively. Importantly, the prominent increase in human N1 latency could not
be explained by the physical lengthening of the auditory pathway, and therefore
reflected an extended dwell time for auditory cortical processing. A longer time 
window for auditory cortical processing is advantageous for analyzing
time-varying acoustic stimuli, such as those important for speech perception. A
novel hypothesis concerning human brain evolution then emerges: the increase in
cortical neuronal number widened the timescale of sensory cortical processing,
the benefits of which outweighed the disadvantage of slow cognition and reaction.

The respiratory system maintains homeostatic levels of oxygen (O2) and carbon
dioxide (CO2) in the body through rapid and efficient regulation of breathing
frequency and depth (tidal volume). The commonly used methods of analyzing
breathing data in behaving experimental animals are usually subjective,
laborious, and time-consuming. To overcome these hurdles, we optimized an
analysis toolkit for the unsupervised study of respiratory activities in animal
subjects. Using this tool, we analyzed breathing behaviors of the common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus), a New World non-human primate model. Using whole-body
plethysmography in room air as well as acute hypoxic (10% O2) and hypercapnic (6%
CO2) conditions, we describe breathing behaviors in awake, freely behaving
marmosets. Our data indicate that marmosets' exposure to acute hypoxia decreased 
metabolic rate and increased sigh rate. However, the hypoxic condition did not
augment ventilation. Hypercapnia, on the other hand, increased both the frequency
and depth (i.e., tidal volume) of breathing.

Burkholderia pseudomallei is the causative agent of melioidosis, a severe human
infection that is difficult to treat with antibiotics and for which there is no
effective vaccine. Development of novel treatments rely upon appropriately
characterized animal models. The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) has been
established at Defense Science and Technology laboratories (DSTL) as a model of
melioidosis. Further analysis was performed on samples generated in these studies
to provide a description of the innate immune response. Many of the immunological
features described, (migration/activation of neutrophils and macrophages,
activation of T cells, elevation of key cytokines IFNγ, TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β)
have been observed in acute melioidosis human cases and correlated with
prognosis. Expression of the MHCII marker (HLA-DR) on neutrophils showed
potential as a diagnostic with 80% accuracy when comparing pre- and postchallenge
levels in paired blood samples. Discriminant analysis of cell surface, activation
markers on neutrophils combined with levels of key cytokines, differentiated
between disease states from single blood samples with 78% accuracy. These key
markers have utility as a prototype postexposure, presymptomatic diagnostic.
Ultimately, these data further validate the use of the marmoset as a suitable
model for determining efficacy of medical countermeasures against B.
pseudomallei.

Purpose: To establish a robust experimental model of glaucoma in the common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a New World primate, using an intracameral
microbead injection technique.
Methods: Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) was induced by an injection of
polystyrene microbeads. Morphologic changes in the retina and optic nerve of
glaucomatous eyes were assessed and electroretinogram (ERG) recordings were
performed to evaluate functional changes.
Results: Microbead injections induced a sustained IOP elevation for at least 10
weeks in a reproducible manner. At the end of the 10-week experimental period,
there was significant loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in all quadrants and 
eccentricities, although it was more prominent in the mid-peripheral and
peripheral regions. This was consistent with a thinning of the Retinal nerve
fiber layer (RNFL) seen in spectral domain optical coherence tomography scans.
Surviving RGCs showed marked changes in morphology, including somatic shrinkage
and dendritic atrophy. Retinas also showed significant gliosis. The amplitude of 
the ERG photopic negative response, with subsequent a- and b-wave changes, was
reduced in glaucomatous eyes. The optic nerve of glaucomatous eyes showed
expanded cupping, disorganization of the astrocytic matrix, axonal loss, and
gliosis.
Conclusions: We developed a robust and reproducible model of glaucoma in the
marmoset. The model exhibits both structural and functional alterations of retina
and optic nerve characteristic of glaucoma in humans and animal models.
Translational Relevance: The glaucoma model in the marmoset described here forms 
a robust method to study the disease etiology, progression, and potential
therapies in a nonhuman primate, allowing for more effective translation of
animal data to humans.

Two strains of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), England 1
and Erasmus Medical Centre/2012 (EMC/2012), were used to challenge common
marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) by three routes of infection: aerosol, oral, and
intranasal. Animals challenged by the intranasal and aerosol routes presented
with mild, transient disease, while those challenged by the oral route presented 
with a subclinical immunological response. Animals challenged with MERS-CoV
strain EMC/2012 by the aerosol route responded with primary and/or secondary
pyrexia. Marmosets had minimal to mild multifocal interstitial pneumonia, with
the greatest relative severity being observed in animals challenged by the
aerosol route. Viable virus was isolated from the host in throat swabs and lung
tissue. The transient disease described is consistent with a successful host
response and was characterized by the upregulation of macrophage and neutrophil
function observed in all animals at the time of euthanasia. IMPORTANCE Middle
East respiratory syndrome is caused by a human coronavirus, MERS-CoV, similar to 
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Humans typically
exhibit fever, cough, shortness of breath, gastrointestinal issues, and breathing
difficulties, which can lead to pneumonia and/or renal complications. This
emerging disease resulted in the first human lethal cases in 2012 and has a case 
fatality rate of approximately 36%. Consequently, there is a need for medical
countermeasures and appropriate animal models for their assessment. This work has
demonstrated the requirement for higher concentrations of virus to cause overt
disease. Challenge by the aerosol, intranasal, and oral routes resulted in no or 
mild disease, but all animals had an immunological response. This shows that an
appropriate early immunological response is able to control the disease.

An 11-year-old male common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) presented with chronic, 
progressive weight loss and diarrhoea. Response to treatment with nutritional
supplementation, antibiotics and immunosuppressants was modest and transient, and
the animal was humanely euthanized. At necropsy, the proximal 8 cm of small
intestine was diffusely pale with transmural thickening. The lungs contained
coalescing tan, firm nodules measuring up to 4 mm in diameter. Histological
examination revealed infiltrative mucinous adenocarcinoma of the duodenum with
extensive metastases to the lungs, liver and left parapatellar adipose tissue.
The mucinous matrix secreted by the primary and metastatic lesions was strongly
periodic acid-Schiff positive. Warthin Starry staining for spirochaetes was
negative. Pancytokeratin expression was attenuated in the primary tumour as well 
as in the metastases, which correlated to a poorly differentiated phenotype. To
the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of a proximal duodenal
adenocarcinoma with extensive metastatic disease in a common marmoset.

Heart failure is one of the most common causes of morbidity and mortality. Both
maturational abnormalities and age-associated cardiac pathologies contribute to
heart failure. Imaging-based assessment to discern detailed cardiac structure at 
various maturational stages is imperative for understanding mechanisms behind
cardiac growth and aging. Using multiphoton nonlinear optical microscopy (NLOM)
based label-free imaging, we investigated cardiac structural composition in a
human-relevant aging model, the common marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus).
Animals were divided into three different age groups including neonatal, young
adult and old. By devising a unique strategy for segregating collagen and myosin 
emitted second harmonic generation (SHG) signals, we performed a volumetric
assessment of collagen and total scattering tissue (collagen + myosin). Aged
marmoset hearts exhibited an increase in collagen and total scattering tissue
volume at the sites of severe tissue remodelling indicating age-related cardiac
fibrosis. Significantly low scattering tissue volume in neonatal marmoset hearts 
was attributed to a lack of binding between the myofibrils in maturing cardiac
tissue. Comprehensive quantitative assessment of structural composition during
maturation and aging of marmoset hearts revealed significant differences in
myofibril length, alignment, curvature and angular distribution. In conclusion,
label-free high-resolution NLOM facilitates visualization and quantification of
subcellular structural features for understanding vital age-related morphological
alterations in the marmoset heart.

Owing to genotype-specific neutralizing antibodies, analyzing differences in the 
immunogenic variation among dengue virus (DENV) genotypes is central to effective
vaccine development. Herein, we characterized the viral kinetics and antibody
response induced by DENV type 2 Asian I (AI) and Asian/American (AA) genotypes
using marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) as models. Two groups of marmosets were
inoculated with AI and AA genotypes, and serial plasma samples were collected.
Viremia levels were determined using quantitative reverse transcription-PCR,
plaque assays, and antigen enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Anti-DENV
immunoglobulin M and G antibodies, neutralizing antibody titer, and
antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) activity were determined using ELISA, plaque
reduction neutralization test, and ADE assay, respectively. The AI genotype
induced viremia for a longer duration, but the AA genotype induced higher levels 
of viremia. After four months, the neutralizing antibody titer induced by the AA 
genotype remained high, but that induced by the AI genotype waned. ADE activity
toward Cosmopolitan genotypes was detected in marmosets inoculated with the AI
genotype. These findings indicate discrepancies between heterologous genotypes
that influence neutralizing antibodies and viremia in marmosets, a critical issue
in vaccine development.

In veterinary medicine, blood transfusion is commonly performed on companion
animals. The common marmoset is a small nonhuman primate with increasing
popularity as an animal model in biomedical research. Because of its small whole 
blood volume, the marmoset is at high risk of exsanguination, and blood
transfusion is required to care for life-threatening bleeding. However, few
clinical evaluations exist on transfusions for marmosets. This study performed
whole blood transfusion with cross-matching on nine marmosets and surveyed the
therapeutic effects. Recipients included clinical cases with persistent bleeding,
anemia, and coma, as well as animals subjected to postoperative bleeding
prophylaxis. Donors were selected from healthy marmosets, including littermates. 
Cross-match assay before transfusion were all negative, and recipients showed no 
visible signs of transfusion-related adverse reactions. Whole blood transfusions 
caused hemostasis and successful recovery in bleeding marmosets, including
long-term improvement of anemia cases. Our results indicated that blood
transfusion is effective for marmosets with severe anemia and persistent
hemorrhage from both non-experimental and surgical causes. Furthermore, DNA
sequencing for blood-group classification revealed that all subject marmosets
were type A, suggesting that the risk of blood type mismatch may be low in this
species.

The common marmoset has emerged as a popular model in neuroscience research, in
part due to its reproductive efficiency, genetic and neuroanatomical similarities
to humans and the successful generation of transgenic lines. Stereotaxic
procedures in marmosets are guided by 2D stereotaxic atlases, which are
constructed with a limited number of animals and fail to account for
inter-individual variability in skull and brain size. Here, we developed a
frameless imaging-guided stereotaxic system that improves upon traditional
approaches by using subject-specific registration of computed tomography (CT),
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) data to
identify a surgical target, namely the putamen, in two marmosets. The skull
surface was laser-scanned to create a point cloud that was registered to the 3D
reconstruction of the skull from CT. Reconstruction of the skull, as well as of
the brain from MR images, was crucial for surgical planning. Localisation and
injection into the putamen was done using a 6-axis robotic arm controlled by a
surgical navigation software (Brainsight™). Integration of subject-specific
registration and frameless stereotaxic navigation allowed target localisation
specific to each animal. Injection of alpha-synuclein fibrils into the putamen
triggered progressive neurodegeneration of the nigro-striatal system, a key
feature of Parkinson's disease. Four months post-surgery, a PET scan found
evidence of nigro-striatal denervation, supporting accurate targeting of the
putamen during co-registration and subsequent surgery. Our results suggest that
this approach, coupled with frameless stereotaxic neuronavigation, is accurate in
localising surgical targets and can be used to assess endpoints for longitudinal 
studies.

The Genomic Organization of the LILR Region Remained Largely Conserved Throughout
Primate Evolution: Implications for Health And Disease.

The genes of the leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor (LILR) family map to the 
leukocyte receptor complex (LRC) on chromosome 19, and consist of both activating
and inhibiting entities. These receptors are often involved in regulating immune 
responses, and are considered to play a role in health and disease. The human
LILR region and evolutionary equivalents in some rodent and bird species have
been thoroughly characterized. In non-human primates, the LILR region is
annotated, but a thorough comparison between humans and non-human primates has
not yet been documented. Therefore, it was decided to undertake a comprehensive
comparison of the human and non-human primate LILR region at the genomic level.
During primate evolution the organization of the LILR region remained largely
conserved. One major exception, however, is provided by the common marmoset, a
New World monkey species, which seems to feature a substantial contraction of the
number of LILR genes in both the centromeric and the telomeric region.
Furthermore, genomic analysis revealed that the killer-cell immunoglobulin-like
receptor gene KIR3DX1, which maps in the LILR region, features one copy in humans
and great ape species. A second copy, which might have been introduced by a
duplication event, was observed in the lesser apes, and in Old and New World
monkey species. The highly conserved gene organization allowed us to standardize 
the LILR gene nomenclature for non-human primate species, and implies that most
of the receptors encoded by these genes likely fulfill highly preserved
functions.

Astrocytes are abundant cells of the central nervous system (CNS) and are
involved in processes including synapse formation/function, ion homeostasis,
neurotransmitter uptake, and neurovascular coupling. Recent evidence indicates
that astrocytes show diverse molecular, structural, and physiological properties 
within the CNS. This heterogeneity is reflected in differences in astrocyte
structure, gene expression, functional properties, and responsiveness to
injury/pathological conditions. Deeper investigation of astrocytic heterogeneity 
is needed to understand how astrocytes are configured to enable diverse roles in 
the CNS. While much has been learned about astrocytic heterogeneity in rodents,
much less is known about astrocytic heterogeneity in the primate brain where
astrocytes have greater size and complexity. The common marmoset (Callithrix
jacchus) is a promising non-human primate model because of similarities between
marmosets and humans with respect to genetics, brain anatomy, and
cognition/behavior. Here, we investigated the molecular and structural
heterogeneity of marmoset astrocytes using an array of astrocytic markers,
multi-label confocal microscopy, and quantitative analysis. We used male and
female marmosets and found that marmoset astrocytes show differences in
expression of astrocytic markers in cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum. These
differences were accompanied by intra-regional variation in expression of markers
for glutamate/GABA transporters, and potassium and water channels. Differences in
astrocyte structure were also found, along with complex interactions with blood
vessels, microglia, and neurons. This study contributes to our knowledge of the
cellular and molecular features of marmoset astrocytes and is useful for
understanding the complex properties of astrocytes in the primate CNS.

Within-group competition over food resources can be a major cost of social
living. In the wild, foragers are confronted with social (e.g. hierarchical rank)
and ecological (e.g. food availability and distribution) challenges that affect
their foraging decisions and feeding success. Exhibiting prosocial behaviours,
such as tolerance at feeding sites, can benefit group members by developing
affiliative social relationships, enhancing access to resources and maximizing
fitness. We examined social tolerance at feeding sites in Callithrix jacchus, a
cooperatively breeding primate species. We investigated the set of social (rank, 
age and sex) and ecological (food availability) factors that influence the
structure and dynamics of within-group foraging association networks. We designed
and conducted an experimental field study of four wild groups of common marmosets
in which we controlled food distribution (concentrated or scattered) and
productivity (high, medium or low food rewards). Then, we used social network
analyses to assess the number and strength of foraging associations among group
members, their effects on individual food consumption, and whether recent
experiences with conspecifics during foraging affected subsequent associations.
Overall, common marmoset foraging association networks were cohesive, as group
members jointly occupied feeding sites. The number and strength of associations
varied depending on the ecological context. Associations were stronger during
conditions in which food was concentrated at a single site. Individuals obtained 
greater access to food resources when sharing a feeding site with conspecifics,
but once a food item was obtained, the forager moved to a nearby tree and
consumed it away from others. Additionally, the strength of previous foraging
associations and subsequent levels of social tolerance at feeding sites were
positively related, a relationship compatible with the ability of memorizing
associations over time and recalling the information in future decision-making.
In sum, marmosets adjusted their partner choices and the strength of foraging
associations in response to food availability. They exhibited increased social
tolerance at feeding sites during conditions in which opportunities for contest
competition were expected to be greatest. These cooperative breeding primates
appear to mutually benefit by maintaining cohesive and strong affiliative
relationships, and by increasing opportunities for coordinated behaviour and
offspring survival.

Publisher: A competição por recursos alimentares dentro do grupo pode ser um
grande custo da vida social. Na natureza, os forrageadores são confrontados com
desafios sociais (e.g. posição hierárquica) e ecológicos (e.g. disponibilidade e 
distribuição de alimentos) que afetam suas decisões de forrageio e seu sucesso
alimentar. Exibir comportamentos pró-sociais, como tolerância em sítios de
alimentação, pode beneficiar os membros do grupo, desenvolvendo relações sociais 
afiliativas, melhorando o acesso aos recursos e maximizando sua aptidão
evolutiva. Examinamos a tolerância social de um primata com reprodução
cooperativa (Callithrix jacchus) em sítios de alimentação. Investigamos a
influência de um conjunto de fatores sociais (hierarquia, idade, sexo) e
ecológicos (disponibilidade de alimento) na estrutura e dinâmica das redes de
associação de forrageio dentro do grupo social. Planejamos e conduzimos um
experimento de campo com quatro grupos de saguis-comuns de vida livre, no qual
controlamos a distribuição (concentrada e dispersa) e a produtividade de alimento
(altas, médias ou baixas recompensas). Usamos análise de redes sociais para
avaliar o número e a força das associações de forrageio entre os membros do
grupo, seu efeito no consumo individual de alimento, e se experiências recentes
de forrageio entre coespecíficos afetam associações subsequentes. Em geral, as
redes de associação de forrageio dos saguis foram coesas e os membros de cada
grupo ocuparam sítios de alimentação em conjunto. O número e a força das
associações variaram dependendo do contexto ecológico. As associações foram mais 
fortes durante as condições em que o alimento se encontrava concentrado em um
sítio. Os indivíduos obtiveram maior acesso aos recursos quando compartilharam o 
sítio de alimentação com coespecíficos, e uma vez que o item alimentar era
obtido, o forrageador o consumia em uma árvore próxima, longe dos outros. Além
disso, a força das associações recentes e os níveis subsequentes de tolerância
social em sítios de alimentação foram positivamente relacionados, compatível com 
a capacidade de memorizar associações ao longo do tempo e relembrá-las em tomadas
de decisão futuras. Em conclusão, os saguis ajustaram suas escolhas de parceiros 
e a força das associações de forrageio em resposta à disponibilidade de alimento.
Eles exibiram uma maior tolerância social em sítios de alimentação durante as
condições em que se esperava que as oportunidades de competição direta fossem
maiores. Estes primatas com reprodução cooperativa parecem se beneficiar
mutuamente ao manterem relações afiliativas coesas e fortes, as quais aumentam as
oportunidades para comportamentos coordenados e a sobrevivência da prole.

Genetic engineering of non-human primates, which are most closely related to
humans, has been expected to generate ideal animal models for human genetic
diseases. The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a non-human primate species
adequate for the production of genetically modified animals because of their
small body size and high reproductive capacity. Autologous embryo transfer (AET) 
is routinely utilized in assisted reproductive technologies for humans but not
for experimental animals. This study has developed a novel method for efficiently
producing mutant marmosets using AET and CRISPR/Cas9 systems. The embryos were
recovered from oviducts of naturally mated females, injected with Cas9/guide RNA,
and transferred into the oviducts of the donors. This AET method can reduce the
time for in vitro culture of embryos to less than 30 min. This method uses an
embryo donor as the recipient, thus reducing the number of animals and allowing
for "Reduction" in the 3R principles of humane experimental technique.
Furthermore, this method can utilize nulliparous females as well as parous
females. We applied our novel method and generated the 6 marmosets carrying
mutations in the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene using only 18 females
including 14 nulliparous females.

Mismatch negativity (MMN) is a candidate biomarker for neuropsychiatric disease. 
Understanding the extent to which it reflects cognitive deviance-detection or
purely sensory processes will assist practitioners in making informed clinical
interpretations. This study compares the utility of deviance-detection and
sensory-processing theories for describing MMN-like auditory responses of a
common marmoset monkey during roving oddball stimulation. The following
exploratory analyses were performed on an existing dataset: responses during the 
transition and repetition sequence of the roving oddball paradigm (standard ->
deviant/S1 -> S2 -> S3) were compared; long-latency potentials evoked by deviant 
stimuli were examined using a double-epoch waveform subtraction; effects of
increasing stimulus repetitions on standard and deviant responses were analyzed; 
and transitions between standard and deviant stimuli were divided into ascending 
and descending frequency changes to explore contributions of
frequency-sensitivity. An enlarged auditory response to deviant stimuli was
observed. This decreased exponentially with stimulus repetition, characteristic
of sensory gating. A slow positive deflection was viewed over approximately
300-800 ms after the deviant stimulus, which is more difficult to ascribe to
afferent sensory mechanisms. When split into ascending and descending frequency
transitions, the resulting difference waveforms were disproportionally influenced
by descending frequency deviant stimuli. This asymmetry is inconsistent with the 
general deviance-detection theory of MMN. These findings tentatively suggest that
MMN-like responses from common marmosets are predominantly influenced by rapid
sensory adaptation and frequency preference of the auditory cortex, while
deviance-detection may play a role in long-latency activity.

Understanding masseter muscle (MM) innervation is critical for the study of
cell-specific mechanisms of pain induced by temporomandibular disorder (TMDs) or 
after facial surgery. Here, we identified trigeminal (TG) sensory neuronal
subtypes (MM TG neurons) innervating MM fibers, masseteric fascia, tendons, and
adjusted tissues. A combination of patch clamp electrophysiology and
immunohistochemistry (IHC) on TG neurons back-traced from reporter mouse MM found
nine distinct subtypes of MM TG neurons. Of these neurons, 24% belonged to
non-peptidergic IB-4+/TRPA1- or IB-4+/TRPA1+ groups, while two TRPV1+ small-sized
neuronal groups were classified as peptidergic/CGRP+ One small-sized CGRP+
neuronal group had a unique electrophysiological profile and were recorded from
Nav1.8- or trkC+ neurons. The remaining CGRP+ neurons were medium-sized, could be
divided into Nav1.8-/trkC- and Nav1.8low/trkC+ clusters, and showed large
5HT-induced current. The final two MM TG neuronal groups were trkC+ and had no
Nav1.8 and CGRP. Among MM TG neurons, TRPV1+/CGRP- (somatostatin+), tyrosine
hydroxylase (TH)+ (C-LTMR), TRPM8+, MrgprA3+, or trkB+ (Aδ-LTMR) subtypes have
not been detected. Masseteric muscle fibers, tendons and masseteric fascia in
mice and the common marmoset, a new world monkey, were exclusively innervated by 
either CGRP+/NFH+ or CGRP-/NFH+ medium-to-large neurons, which we found using a
Nav1.8-YFP reporter, and labeling with CGRP, TRPV1, neurofilament heavy chain
(NFH) and pgp9.5 antibodies. These nerves were mainly distributed in tendon and
at junctions of deep-middle-superficial parts of MM. Overall, the data presented 
here demonstrates that MM is innervated by a distinct subset of TG neurons, which
have unique characteristics and innervation patterns.

Adeno-associated virus 6 (AAV6) has been proposed as a potential vector candidate
for specific gene expression in pain-related dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, 
but this has not been confirmed in nonhuman primates. The aim of our study was to
analyze the transduction efficiency and target specificity of this viral vector
in the common marmoset by comparing it with those in the rat. When green
fluorescent protein-expressing serotype-6 vector was injected into the sciatic
nerve, the efficiency of gene expression in DRG neurons was comparable in both
species. We found that the serotype-6 vector was largely specific to the
pain-related ganglion neurons in the marmoset, as well as in the rat, whereas the
serotype-9 vector resulted in contrasting effects in the two species. Neither
AAV6 nor AAV9 resulted in DRG toxicity when administered via the sciatic nerve,
suggesting this as a safer route of sensory nerve transduction than the currently
used intrathecal or intravenous administrative routes. Furthermore, the AAV6
vector could be an optimal serotype for gene therapy for human chronic pain that 
has a minimal effect on other somatosensory functions of DRG neurons.

Precise cochlear neuronal development is vital to hearing ability. Understanding 
the developmental process of the spiral ganglion is useful for studying hearing
loss aimed at aging or regenerative therapy. Although interspecies differences
have been reported between rodents and humans, to date, most of our knowledge
about the development of cochlear neuronal development has been obtained from
rodent models because of the difficulty in using human fetal samples in this
field. In this study, we investigated cochlear neuronal development in a small
New World monkey species, the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). We examined
more than 25 genes involved in the neuronal development of the cochlea and
described the critical developmental steps of these neurons. We also revealed
similarities and differences between previously reported rodent models and this
primate animal model. Our results clarified that this animal model of cochlear
neuronal development is more similar to humans than rodents and is suitable as an
alternative for the analysis of human cochlear development. The time course
established in this report will be a useful tool for studying primate-specific
neuronal biology of the inner ear, which could eventually lead to new treatment
strategies for human hearing loss.

The technology, methodology and models used by visual neuroscientists have
provided great insights into the structure and function of individual brain
areas. However, complex cognitive functions arise in the brain due to networks
comprising multiple interacting cortical areas that are wired together with
precise anatomical connections. A prime example of this phenomenon is the
frontal-parietal network and two key regions within it: the frontal eye fields
(FEF) and lateral intraparietal area (area LIP). Activity in these cortical areas
has independently been tied to oculomotor control, motor preparation, visual
attention and decision-making. Strong, bidirectional anatomical connections have 
also been traced between FEF and area LIP, suggesting that the aforementioned
visual functions depend on these inter-area interactions. However, advancements
in our knowledge about the interactions between area LIP and FEF are limited with
the main animal model, the rhesus macaque, because these key regions are buried
in the sulci of the brain. In this review, we propose that the common marmoset is
the ideal model for investigating how anatomical connections give rise to
functionally-complex cognitive visual behaviours, such as those modulated by the 
frontal-parietal network, because of the homology of their cortical networks with
humans and macaques, amenability to transgenic technology, and rich behavioural
repertoire. Furthermore, the lissencephalic structure of the marmoset brain
enables application of powerful techniques, such as array-based electrophysiology
and optogenetics, which are critical to bridge the gaps in our knowledge about
structure and function in the brain.

Frontoparietal networks contribute to complex cognitive functions in humans and
macaques, such as working memory, attention, task-switching, response
suppression, grasping, reaching, and eye movement control. However, there has
been no comprehensive examination of the functional organization of
frontoparietal networks using functional magnetic resonance imaging in the New
World common marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus), which is now widely recognized
as a powerful nonhuman primate experimental animal. In this study, we employed
hierarchical clustering of interareal blood oxygen level-dependent signals to
investigate the hypothesis that the organization of the frontoparietal cortex in 
the marmoset follows the organizational principles of the macaque frontoparietal 
system. We found that the posterior part of the lateral frontal cortex (premotor 
regions) was functionally connected to the anterior parietal areas, while more
anterior frontal regions (frontal eye field [FEF]) were connected to more
posterior parietal areas (the region around the lateral intraparietal area
[LIP]). These overarching patterns of interareal organization are consistent with
a recent macaque study. These findings demonstrate parallel frontoparietal
processing streams in marmosets and support the functional similarities of
FEF-LIP and premotor-anterior parietal pathways between marmoset and macaque.

Structural and functional abnormalities of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) have
been implicated in affective disorders that manifest anxiety-related symptoms.
However, research into the functions of primate OFC has predominantly focused on 
reward-oriented rather than threat-oriented responses. To redress this imbalance,
the present study performed a comprehensive analysis of the independent role of 2
distinct subregions of the central OFC (anterior area 11; aOFC and posterior area
13; pOFC) in the processing of distal and proximal threat. Temporary inactivation
of both aOFC and pOFC heightened responses to distal threat in the form of an
unknown human, but not to proximal threat assessed in a discriminative Pavlovian 
conditioning task. Inactivation of the aOFC, however, did unexpectedly blunt
conditioned threat responses, although the effect was not valence-specific, as
conditioned appetitive responses were similarly blunted and appeared restricted
to a discriminative version of the task (when both CS- and CS+ are present within
a session). Inactivation of the pOFC did not affect conditioned responses to
either proximal threat or reward and basal cardiovascular activity was unaffected
by manipulations of activity in either subregion. The results highlight the
contribution of aOFC and pOFC to regulation of responses to more distal uncertain
but not proximal, certain threat and reveal their opposing contribution to that
of the immediately adjacent medial OFC, area 14.

The common marmoset has enormous promise as a nonhuman primate model of human
brain functions. While resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) has provided evidence 
for a similar organization of marmoset and human cortices, the technique cannot
be used to map the functional correspondences of brain regions between species.
This limitation can be overcome by movie-driven fMRI (md-fMRI), which has become 
a popular tool for noninvasively mapping the neural patterns generated by rich
and naturalistic stimulation. Here, we used md-fMRI in marmosets and humans to
identify whole-brain functional correspondences between the two primate species. 
In particular, we describe functional correlates for the well-known human face,
body, and scene patches in marmosets. We find that these networks have a similar 
organization in both species, suggesting a largely conserved organization of
higher-order visual areas between New World marmoset monkeys and humans. However,
while face patches in humans and marmosets were activated by marmoset faces, only
human face patches responded to the faces of other animals. Together, the results
demonstrate that higher-order visual processing might be a conserved feature
between humans and New World marmoset monkeys but that small, potentially
important functional differences exist.

Human DNA methylation data have previously been used to develop highly accurate
biomarkers of aging ("epigenetic clocks"). Subsequent studies demonstrate that
similar epigenetic clocks can also be developed for mice and many other mammals. 
Here, we describe epigenetic clocks for common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus)
based on novel DNA methylation data generated from highly conserved mammalian
CpGs that were profiled using a custom Infinium array
(HorvathMammalMethylChip40). From these, we developed and present here two
epigenetic clocks for marmosets that are applicable to whole blood samples. We
find that the human-marmoset clock for relative age exhibits moderately high age 
correlations in two other non-human primate species: vervet monkeys and rhesus
macaques. In a separate cohort of marmosets, we tested whether intervention with 
rapamycin, a drug shown to extend lifespan in mice, would alter the epigenetic
age of marmosets, as measured by the marmoset epigenetic clocks. These clocks did
not detect significant effects of rapamycin on the epigenetic age of marmoset
blood. The common marmoset stands out from other mammals in that it is not
possible to build accurate estimators of sex based on DNA methylation data: the
accuracy of a random forest predictor of sex (66%) was substantially lower than
that observed for other mammals (which is close to 100%). Overall, the epigenetic
clocks developed here for the common marmoset are expected to be useful for age
estimation of wild-born animals and for anti-aging studies in this species.

Dyskinesia and psychosis are complications encountered in advanced Parkinson's
disease (PD) following long-term therapy with L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine
(L-DOPA). Disturbances in the glutamatergic system have been associated with both
dyskinesia and psychosis, making glutamatergic modulation a potential therapeutic
approach for these. Treatments thus far have sought to dampen glutamatergic
transmission, for example through blockade of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)
receptors or modulation of metabotropic glutamate receptors 5. In contrast,
activation of the glycine-binding site on NMDA receptors is required for their
physiological response. Here, we investigated whether indirectly enhancing
glutamatergic transmission through inhibition of glycine re-uptake would be
efficacious in diminishing both dyskinesia and psychosis-like behaviours (PLBs)
in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-lesioned common
marmoset. Six marmosets were rendered parkinsonian by MPTP injection. Following
repeated administration of L-DOPA to induce dyskinesia and PLBs, they underwent
acute challenges of the glycine transporter 1 (GlyT1) inhibitor ALX-5407 (0.01,
0.1 and 1 mg/kg) or vehicle, in combination with L-DOPA, after which the severity
of dyskinesia, PLBs and parkinsonian disability was evaluated. In combination
with L-DOPA, ALX-5407 0.1 and 1 mg/kg significantly reduced the severity of
dyskinesia, by 51% and 41% (both P < 0.001), when compared to vehicle. ALX-5407
0.01, 0.1 and 1 mg/kg also decreased the severity of global PLBs, by 25%, 51% and
38% (all P < 0.001), when compared to vehicle. The benefits on dyskinesia and
PLBs were achieved without compromising the therapeutic effect of L-DOPA on
parkinsonism. Our results suggest that GlyT1 inhibition may be a novel strategy
to attenuate dyskinesia and PLBs in PD, without interfering with L-DOPA
anti-parkinsonian action.

Animal welfare is critical to buffer stress in captive animals and to ensure the 
reliability of data from studies. The most usual environmental enrichment
technique (EE) for social non-human primates is the social enrichment. However,
some experimental protocols require keeping individuals isolated, thus demanding 
other types of EE. We tested in six adult Callithrix jacchus females, single
housed for experimental purpose, the stress buffering efficacy of a structural
enrichment protocol (SEP) and SEP in combination with a foraging enrichment
(FSEP) using  fecal cortisol and behaviors to infer stress levels. Both types of 
EE improved welfare in different ways, while cortisol levels decreased with both 
EE as compared to the baseline, autogrooming, and piloerection increased after
FSEP probably due to the new foods. Therefore, these findings support alternative
practices of EE when social animals are living in isolation and reinforce the
positive role of structural and food enrichment for decreasing stress markers. It
also encourages studies on welfare with females, since its use as an animal model
has increased.

Disorders and Stroke, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.

Astrocytes, the star-shaped glial cells, are the most abundant non-neuronal cell 
population in the central nervous system. They play a key role in modulating
activities of neural networks, including those involved in complex motor
behaviors. Common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus), the most vocal non-human
primate (NHP), have been used to study the physiology of vocalization and social 
vocal production. However, the neural circuitry involved in vocal production is
not fully understood. In addition, even less is known about the involvement of
astrocytes in this circuit. To understand the role, that astrocytes may play in
the complex behavior of vocalization, the initial step may be to study their
structural properties in the cortical and subcortical regions that are known to
be involved in vocalization. Here, in the common marmoset, we identify all
astrocytic subtypes seen in other primate's brains, including intralaminar
astrocytes. In addition, we reveal detailed structural characteristics of
astrocytes and perform morphometric analysis of astrocytes residing in the cortex
and midbrain regions that are associated with vocal production. We found that
cortical astrocytes in these regions illustrate a higher level of complexity when
compared to those in the midbrain. We hypothesize that this complexity that is
expressed in cortical astrocytes may reflect their functions to meet the
metabolic/structural needs of these regions.

Studies of personality traits in common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) indicate
that there are five or six constructs-Sociability, Dominance, Neuroticism,
Openness, and two related to Conscientiousness. The present study attempted to
determine whether our earlier study of laboratory-housed individuals only yielded
three-Dominance, Sociability, and Neuroticism-because of a low amount of
between-subjects variance. To do so, we increased our sample size from 77 to 128.
In addition, we ascertained the reliability and validity of ratings and whether
polymorphisms related to the serotonin 1a receptor were associated with
personality. We found Sociability, Dominance, and Negative Affect factors that
resembled three domains found in previous studies, including ours. We also found 
an Openness and Impulsiveness factor, the latter of which bore some resemblance
to Conscientiousness, and two higher-order factors, Pro-sociality and Boldness.
In further analyses, we could not exclude the possibility that Pro-sociality and 
Boldness represented a higher-level of personality organization. Correlations
between personality factors and well-being were consistent with the definitions
of the factors. There were no significant associations between personality and
genotype. These results suggest that common marmoset personality structure varies
as a function of rearing or housing variables that have not yet been investigated
systematically.

Cytosolic sulfotransferase SULT1C subfamily is one of the most flexible gene
subfamilies during mammalian evolution. The physiological functions of SULT1C
enzymes still remain to be fully understood. In this study, common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus), a promising primate animal model, was used to investigate
the functional relevance of the SULT1C subfamily. Gene database search revealed 3
intact SULT1C genes and a pseudogene in its genome. These 4 genes were named
SULT1C1, SULT1C2, SULT1C3P, and SULT1C5, according to the sequence homology and
gene location. Since SULT1C5 is the orthologous gene for human SULT1C2P, we
propose, here, to revisit the designation of human SULT1C2P to SULT1C5P. Purified
recombinant SULT1C enzymes showed sulfating activities toward a variety of
xenobiotic compounds and thyroid hormones. Kinetic analysis revealed high
catalytic activities of SULT1C1 and SULT1C5 for 3,3'-T2. It appears therefore
that SULT1C isoforms may play a role in the thyroid hormone metabolism in common 
marmoset.

Connexins are gap junction components that are essential for acquiring normal
hearing ability. Up to 50% of congenital, autosomal-recessive, non-syndromic
deafness can be attributed to variants in GJB2, the gene that encodes connexin
26. Gene therapies modifying the expression of connexins are a feasible treatment
option for some patients with genetic hearing losses. However, the expression
patterns of these proteins in the human fetus are not fully understood due to
ethical concerns. Recently, the common marmoset was used as a primate animal
model for the human fetus. In this study, we examined the expression patterns of 
connexin 26 and connexin 30 in the developing cochlea of this primate.
Primate-specific spatiotemporal expression changes were revealed, which suggest
the existence of primate-specific control of connexin expression patterns and
specific functions of these gap junction proteins. Moreover, our results indicate
that treatments for connexin-related hearing loss established in rodent models
may not be appropriate for human patients, underscoring the importance of testing
these treatments in primate models before applying them in human clinical trials.

Recent studies find increasing evidence for vocal accommodation in nonhuman
primates, indicating that this form of vocal learning is more prevalent than
previously thought. Convergent vocal accommodation (i.e. becoming more similar to
partners) indicates social closeness. At the same time, however, becoming too
similar may compromise individual recognisability. This is especially problematic
if individual recognisability is an important part of the call function, like in 
long-distance contact calls. In contrast, in calls with a different function, the
trade-off between signalling social closeness and individual recognisability
might be less severe. We therefore hypothesized that the extent and consequences 
of accommodation depend on the function of a given call, and expected (1) more
accommodation in calls for which individual identity is less crucial and (2) that
individual identity is less compromised in calls that serve mainly to transmit
identity compared to calls where individual recognisability is less important. We
quantified vocal accommodation in three call types over the process of pair
formation in common marmoset monkeys (Callithrix jacchus, n = 20). These three
call types have different functions and vary with the degree to which they refer 
to individual identity of the caller. In accordance with our predictions, we
found that animals converged most in close contact calls (trill calls), but less 
in calls where individual identity is more essential (phee- and food calls). In
two out of three call types, the amount of accommodation was predicted by the
initial vocal distance. Moreover, accommodation led to a drop in statistical
individual recognisability in trill calls, but not in phee calls and food calls. 
Overall, our study shows that patterns of vocal accommodation vary between call
types with different functions, suggestive of trade-offs between signalling
social closeness and individual recognisability in marmoset vocalizations.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is an omnivorous New World primate whose
diet in the wild includes large amounts of fruit, seeds, flowers, and a variety
of lizards and invertebrates. Marmosets also feed heavily on tree gums and
exudates, and they have evolved unique morphological and anatomical
characteristics to facilitate gum feeding (gummivory). In this study, we
characterized the fecal microbiomes of adult and infant animals from a captive
population of common marmosets at the Callitrichid Research Center at the
University of Nebraska at Omaha under their normal dietary and environmental
conditions. The microbiomes of adult animals were dominated by species of
Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides, Prevotella, Phascolarctobacterium, Megamonas, and
Megasphaera. Culturing and genomic analysis of the Bifidobacterium populations
from adult animals identified four known marmoset-associated species (B. reuteri,
B. aesculapii, B. myosotis, and B. hapali) and three unclassified taxa of
Bifidobacterium that are phylogenetically distinct. Species-specific quantitative
PCR (qPCR) confirmed that these same species of Bifidobacterium are abundant
members of the microbiome throughout the lives of the animals. Genomic loci in
each Bifidobacterium species encode enzymes to support growth and major marmoset 
milk oligosaccharides during breastfeeding; however, metabolic islands that can
support growth on complex polysaccharide substrates in the diets of captive
adults (pectin, xyloglucan, and xylan), including loci in B. aesculapii that can 
support its unique ability to grow on arabinogalactan-rich tree gums, were
species-specific. IMPORTANCE Bifidobacterium species are recognized as important,
beneficial microbes in the human gut microbiome, and their ability colonize
individuals at different stages of life is influenced by host, dietary,
environmental, and ecological factors, which is poorly understood. The common
marmoset is an emerging nonhuman primate model with a short maturation period,
making this model amenable to study the microbiome throughout a life history.
Features of the microbiome in captive marmosets are also shared with human gut
microbiomes, including abundant populations of Bifidobacterium species. Our
studies show that several species of Bifidobacterium are dominant members of the 
captive marmoset microbiome throughout their life history. Metabolic capacities
in genomes of the marmoset Bifidobacterium species suggest species-specific
adaptations to different components of the captive marmoset diet, including the
unique capacity in B. aesculapii for degradation of gum arabic, suggesting that
regular dietary exposure in captivity may be important for preserving
gum-degrading species in the microbiome.

BACKGROUND: Food avoidance secondary to disease or stress can lead to weight loss
and rapid deterioration of clinical condition in the common marmoset (Callithrix 
jacchus). Currently, there are no data supporting the use of any pharmaceuticals 
as an appetite stimulant in this species; however, benzodiazepines are frequently
used for this purpose in other species.
METHODS: Six marmosets were used in a crossover study design to evaluate the
benzodiazepine midazolam as an appetite stimulant and anxiolytic. Total food
intake (TFI) and latency to eat (LTE) were measured following administration of
oral and injectable midazolam in non-anxious and anxious states.
RESULTS: Injectable midazolam increased TFI and decreased LTE in anxious
marmosets, but had no effect in non-anxious animals. Oral midazolam had no effect
on appetite in either state.
CONCLUSIONS: Injectable midazolam may be an effective treatment for
anxiety-induced inappetence in marmosets. Individual response to both oral and
injectable midazolam may vary.

Marmoset glutathione transferases with ketosteroid isomerase activity.

University, SE-10691, Stockholm. Sweden.

The common marmoset Callithrix jacchus encodes two glutathione transferase (GST) 
enzymes with ketosteroid double-bond isomerase activity. The most active enzyme
is CjaGST A3-3 showing a specific activity with 5-androsten-3,17-dione (Δ5-AD) of
62.1 ± 1.8 μmol min-1 mg-1, and a kcat value of 261 ± 49 s-1. The second
ketosteroid isomerase CjaGST A1-1 has a 30-fold lower specific activity with
Δ5-AD and a 37-fold lower kcat value. Thus, the marmoset CjaGST A3-3 would be the
main contributor to the biosynthesis of the steroid hormones testosterone and
progesterone, like the human ortholog HsaGST A3-3. Two residues differ in the
H-site of the 91.4% sequence identical CjaGST A1-1 and CjaGST A3-3, and modeling 
of the structures suggests that the bulky phenyl ring of Phe111 in CjaGST A1-1
causes steric hindrance in the binding of the steroid substrate. Tributyltin
acetate (IC50=0.16 ± 0.004 μM) and ethacrynic acid (IC50=3.3 ± 0.2 μM) were found
to be potent inhibitors of CjaGST A3-3, as previously demonstrated with the human
and equine orthologs.

The common marmoset, a New World monkey, has a primate-specific cortex with
approximately 40 Brodmann areas. Genetically encoded calcium indicator (GECI)
techniques have been applied to study the functional organization of the marmoset
cortex. The success of GCaMP (a green fluorescent of GECI) imaging and other
advances, including optogenetic approaches, provide an interesting and exciting
opportunity to study the primate brain at the molecular and cellular levels,
leading to an understanding of primate neural circuits. These approaches will
help advance our knowledge on cognition in primates, including humans, and
therapy for human neurological and psychiatric disorders.

This study was aimed at establishing the subcorticals substrates of the cognitive
and visceromotor circuits of the A32 and A25 cortices of the medial prefrontal
cortex and their projections and interactions with subcortical complexes in the
common marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus). The study was primarily restricted
to the nuclei of the diencephalon and amygdala. The common marmoset is a
neotropical primate of the new world, and the absence of telencephalic gyrus
favors the mapping of neuronal fibers. The biotinylated dextran amine was
employed as an anterograde tracer. There was an evident pattern of rostrocaudal
distribution of fibers within the subcortical nuclei, with medial orientation.
Considering this distribution, fibers originating from the A25 cortex were found 
to be more clustered in the diencephalon and amygdala than those originating in
the A32 cortex. Most areas of the amygdala received fibers from both cortices. In
the diencephalon, all regions received projections from the A32, while the A25
fibers were restricted to the thalamus, hypothalamus, and epithalamus at
different densities. Precise deposits of neuronal tracers provided here may
significantly contribute to expand our understanding of specific connectivity
among the medial prefrontal cortex with limbic regions and diencephalic areas,
key elements to the viscerocognitive process.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a small New World primate, is receiving
substantial attention in the neuroscience and biomedical science fields because
its anatomical features, functional and behavioral characteristics, and
reproductive features and its amenability to available genetic modification
technologies make it an attractive experimental subject. In this review, I
outline the progress of marmoset neuroscience research and summarize both the
current status (opportunities and limitations) of and the future perspectives on 
the application of marmosets in neuroscience and disease modeling.

Objective.The common marmoset has been increasingly used in neural interfacing
studies due to its smaller size, easier handling, and faster breeding compared to
Old World non-human primate (NHP) species. While assessment of cortical anatomy
in marmosets has shown strikingly similar layout to macaques, comprehensive
assessment of electrophysiological properties underlying forelimb reaching
movements in this bridge species does not exist. The objective of this study is
to characterize electrophysiological properties of signals recorded from the
marmoset primary motor cortex (M1) during a reach task and compare with larger
NHP models such that this smaller NHP model can be used in behavioral neural
interfacing studies.Approach and main results.Neuronal firing rates and local
field potentials (LFPs) were chronically recorded from M1 in three adult, male
marmosets. Firing rates, mu + beta and high gamma frequency bands of LFPs were
evaluated for modulation with respect to movement. Firing rate and regularity of 
neurons of the marmoset M1 were similar to that reported in macaques with a
subset of neurons showing selectivity to movement direction. Movement phases
(rest vs move) was classified from both neural spiking and LFPs. Microelectrode
arrays provide the ability to sample small regions of the motor cortex to drive
brain-machine interfaces (BMIs). The results demonstrate that marmosets are a
robust bridge species for behavioral neuroscience studies with motor cortical
electrophysiological signals recorded from microelectrode arrays that are similar
to Old World NHPs.Significance. As marmosets represent an interesting step
between rodent and macaque models, successful demonstration that neuron
modulation in marmoset motor cortex is analogous to reports in macaques
illustrates the utility of marmosets as a viable species for BMI studies.

Cynomolgus macaque (Macaca fascicularis) and common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus)
have been widely used in human biomedical research. Long-standing primate genome 
assemblies used the human genome as a reference for ordering and orienting the
assembled fragments into chromosomes. Here we performed de novo genome assembly
of these two species without any human genome-based bias observed in the genome
assemblies released earlier. We assembled PacBio long reads, and the resultant
contigs were scaffolded with Hi-C data, which were further refined based on Hi-C 
contact maps and alternate de novo assemblies. The assemblies achieved scaffold
N50 lengths of 149 Mb and 137 Mb for cynomolgus macaque and common marmoset,
respectively. The high fidelity of our assembly is also ascertained by BAC-end
concordance in common marmoset. Our assembly of cynomolgus macaque outperformed
all the available assemblies of this species in terms of contiguity. The
chromosome-scale genome assemblies produced in this study are valuable resources 
for non-human primate models and provide an important baseline in human
biomedical research.

Impaired detection of causal relationships between actions and their outcomes can
lead to maladaptive behavior. However, causal roles of specific prefrontal cortex
(PFC) sub-regions and the caudate nucleus in mediating such relationships in
primates are unclear. We inactivated and overactivated five PFC sub-regions,
reversibly and pharmacologically: areas 24 (perigenual anterior cingulate
cortex), 32 (medial PFC), 11 (anterior orbitofrontal cortex, OFC), 14 (rostral
ventromedial PFC/medial OFC), and 14-25 (caudal ventromedial PFC) and the
anteromedial caudate to examine their role in expressing learned action-outcome
contingencies using a contingency degradation paradigm in marmoset monkeys. Area 
24 or caudate inactivation impaired the response to contingency change, while
area 11 inactivation enhanced it, and inactivation of areas 14, 32, or 14-25 had 
no effect. Overactivation of areas 11 and 24 impaired this response. These
findings demonstrate the distinct roles of PFC sub-regions in goal-directed
behavior and illuminate the candidate neurobehavioral substrates of psychiatric
disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder.

Faces are stimuli of critical importance for primates. The common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus) is a promising model for investigations of face processing, 
as this species possesses oculomotor and face-processing networks resembling
those of macaques and humans. Face processing is often disrupted in
neuropsychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia (SZ), and thus, it is important
to recapitulate underlying circuitry dysfunction preclinically. The
N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) noncompetitive antagonist ketamine has been used
extensively to model the cognitive symptoms of SZ. Here, we investigated the
effects of a subanesthetic dose of ketamine on oculomotor behavior in marmosets
during face viewing. Four marmosets received systemic ketamine or saline
injections while viewing phase-scrambled or intact videos of conspecifics' faces.
To evaluate effects of ketamine on scan paths during face viewing, we identified 
regions of interest in each face video and classified locations of saccade onsets
and landing positions within these areas. A preference for the snout over eye
regions was observed following ketamine administration. In addition, regions in
which saccades landed could be significantly predicted by saccade onset region in
the saline but not the ketamine condition. Effects on saccade control were
limited to an increase in saccade peak velocity in all conditions and a reduction
in saccade amplitudes during viewing of scrambled videos. Thus, ketamine induced 
a significant disruption of scan paths during viewing of conspecific faces but
limited effects on saccade motor control. These findings support the use of
ketamine in marmosets for investigating changes in neural circuits underlying
social cognition in neuropsychiatric disorders.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Face processing, 
an important social cognitive ability, is impaired in neuropsychiatric conditions
such as schizophrenia. The highly social common marmoset model presents an
opportunity to investigate these impairments. We administered subanesthetic doses
of ketamine to marmosets to model the cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia. We
observed a disruption of scan paths during viewing of conspecifics' faces. These 
findings support the use of ketamine in marmosets as a model for investigating
social cognition in neuropsychiatric disorders.

A singular focus on maternal health at the time of a pregnancy leaves much about 
perinatal mortality unexplained, especially when there is growing evidence for
maternal early life effects. Further, lumping stillbirth and early neonatal death
into a single category of perinatal mortality may obscure different causes and
thus different avenues of screening and prevention. The common marmoset monkey
(Callithrix jacchus), a litter-bearing nonhuman primate, is an ideal species in
which to study the independent effects of a mother's early life and adult
phenotypes on pregnancy outcomes. We tested two hypotheses in 59 marmoset
pregnancies at the Southwest National Primate Research Center and the Barshop
Institute for Longevity and Aging Studies. We explored 1) whether pregnancy
outcomes were predicted independently by maternal adult weight versus maternal
litter size and birth weight, and 2) whether stillbirth and early neonatal death 
were differentially predicted by maternal variables. No maternal characteristics 
predicted stillbirth and no maternal adult characteristics predicted early
neonatal death. In univariate Poisson models, triplet-born females had a
significantly increased rate of early neonatal death (IRR[se] = 3.00[1.29], p =
0.011), while higher birth weight females had a decreased rate (IRR[se] =
0.89[0.05], p = 0.039). In multivariate Poisson models, maternal litter size
remained an independent predictor, explaining 13% of the variance in early
neonatal death. We found that the later in the first week those neonates died,
the more weight they lost. Together these findings suggest that triplet-born and 
low birth weight females have distinct developmental trajectories underlying
greater rates of infant loss, losses that we suggest may be attributable to
developmental disruption of infant feeding and carrying. Our findings of early
life contributions to adult pregnancy outcomes in the common marmoset disrupt
mother-blaming narratives of pregnancy outcomes in humans. These narratives hold 
that the pregnant person is solely responsible for pregnancy outcomes and the
health of their children, independent of socioecological factors, a moralistic
framing that has shaped clinical pregnancy management. It is necessary to
differentiate temporal trajectories and causes of perinatal loss and view them as
embedded in external processes to develop screening, diagnostic, and treatment
tools that consider the full arc of a mother's lived experience, from womb to
womb and beyond.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-based episomal vector system enables persistent
transgene expression, which is advantageous for efficient derivation of
transgene-free induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) without viral transduction.
Here, we report establishment of an iPSC line from somatic fibroblasts of a
neonatal common marmoset monkey (marmoset; Callithrix jacchus) using an
all-in-one episomal vector that we newly developed. The established iPSC line,
named NM-iPS, showed standard characteristics of pluripotency such as
pluripotency-related marker expression, three germ layer differentiation, and
normal karyotype (2n = 46). The novel iPSC line would be a useful resource for
stem cell research using non-human primates.

The propagation of assembled α-synuclein (αS) is key to understanding the
pathological mechanisms of synucleinopathies such as Parkinson's disease,
dementia with Lewy bodies, and multiple system atrophy.Here we describe a
nonhuman primate model of αS propagation using common marmosets (Callithrix
jacchus) with an intracerebral injection of synthetic preformed αS fibrils. This 
protocol enables observation of the formation of phosphorylated αS pathology and 
its propagation three months after the injection.

enterotoxins].

Staphylococcus aureus food poisoning was shown by Dack et al. in 1930 to be
caused by staphylococcal enterotoxin (SE) produced by S. aureus, rather than by
the bacterial infection. However, the emetic mechanism of SE has remained
unclear. In this study, we analyzed the emetic activity of SE in several emetic
animal models and tried to elucidate the mechanism of emesis. We established a
small primate, common marmoset, as a novel emetic model for SE. We also analyzed 
the immunofluorescence analysis of the gastrointestinal tract of the common
marmoset and found that SE binds to submucosal mast cells in the gastrointestinal
tract and SE induces degranulation of the mast cells. Furthermore, we showed that
SE induces histamine releases, which is inhibited by mast cell stabilizer. In
addition, treatment of common marmosets with either mast cell stabilizer or
histamine H1 receptor antagonists suppressed the emetic response induced by SE.
These results indicate that orally administered SE binds to submucosal mast cells
in the gastrointestinal tract and causes degranulation, resulting in the release 
of histamine, which in turn causes emesis.

We determined the retinal ganglion cell types projecting to the medial
subdivision of inferior pulvinar (PIm) and the superior colliculus (SC) in the
common marmoset monkey, Callithrix jacchus. Adult marmosets received a
bidirectional tracer cocktail into the PIm (conjugated to Alexa fluor 488), and
the SC (conjugated to Alexa fluor 594) using an MRI-guided approach. One SC
injection included the pretectum. The large majority of retrogradely labelled
cells were obtained from SC injections, with only a small proportion obtained
after PIm injections. Retrogradely labelled cells were injected intracellularly
in vitro using lipophilic dyes (DiI, DiO). The SC and PIm both received input
from a variety of ganglion cell types. Input to the PIm was dominated by broad
thorny (41%), narrow thorny (24%) and large bistratified (25%) ganglion cells.
Input to the SC was dominated by parasol (37%), broad thorny (24%) and narrow
thorny (17%) cells. Midget ganglion cells (which make up the large majority of
primate retinal ganglion cells) and small bistratified (blue-ON/yellow OFF) cells
were never observed to project to SC or PIm. Small numbers of other wide-field
ganglion cell types were also encountered. Giant sparse (presumed
melanopsin-expressing) cells were only seen following the tracer injection which 
included the pretectum. We note that despite the location of pulvinar complex in 
dorsal thalamus, and its increased size and functional importance in primate
evolution, the retinal projections to pulvinar have more in common with SC
projections than they do with projections to the dorsal lateral geniculate
nucleus.

Paraoxonase (PON) plays roles in the metabolism of organophosphate xenobiotics
and drugs. Despite the importance of marmosets for research into drug metabolism 
and pharmacokinetics, marmoset paraoxonase has not yet been fully characterized. 
Consequently, we identified the PON1 gene in the marmoset genome by sequence
homology analysis. Marmoset PON1 cDNA containing an open reading frame (1065 bp) 
was successfully cloned from marmoset liver by reverse transcription-polymerase
chain reaction. The deduced amino acid sequence (355 amino acids) has
approximately 93% identity with the human ortholog and contains important amino
acid residues for substrate binding and calcium ion coordination. According to a 
phylogenetic tree of PON1 amino acid sequences constructed using data from seven 
animal species, marmoset PON1 is closer to human PON1 than it is to the PON1
orthologs of experimental animals such as pigs, rabbits, rats, and mice. Marmoset
PON1 mRNA was predominantly expressed in liver among the five tissues examined.
Marmoset PON1 protein secreted into plasma was detected by immunoblotting. The
paraoxon-hydrolyzing activity in plasma was higher in marmosets than in humans.
Based on these data, we concluded that marmoset and human PON1 have similar
characteristics with regard to genomic structure, amino acid sequences, and
tissue distribution.

Gastrointestinal disease is a frequently encountered problem among captive common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) colonies. Management can be challenging due to the 
number of etiologies responsible for gastrointestinal disease in this species,
limitations on diagnostic capabilities, and lack of effective treatments.
Understanding commonly described GI diseases in the captive marmoset can provide 
insight on the impact these diseases have on research studies and aid in the
development of appropriate management strategies. A review of commonly
encountered GI disease processes as well as routinely implicated causes of GI
disease in the common marmoset are provided. Current strategies in clinical
management of GI disease in the common marmoset, including approaches to colony
health, diagnostic testing, and commonly employed treatments are discussed.

Blunted reward responsivity is associated with anhedonia in humans and is a core 
feature of depression. This protocol describes how to train the common marmoset, 
Callithrix jacchus, on an appetitive Pavlovian conditioning paradigm to measure
behavioral and cardiovascular correlates of anticipatory and consummatory phases 
of reward processing. We describe how to use intracerebral infusions to
manipulate brain regions whose activity is relevant to impaired reward processing
in depression and how the paradigm can be used to test antidepressant efficacy.

Parkinson's disease (PD) psychosis afflicts over half of patients and poses a
significant burden on quality of life. The aetiology of PD psychosis is
multifactorial and likely arises from the complex interaction between dopamine
replacement therapy and disease state. The
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-lesioned common marmoset is a
validated model to predict the efficacy of therapeutic compounds for
treatment-related complications, including PD psychosis. In this model,
psychosis-like behaviours (PLBs) encompass stereotypies that are idiosyncratic in
nature and reproducible with each L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylanaline (L-DOPA)
administration. In the present study, we sought to expand upon the existing
repertoire of PLBs through the characterisation of novel stereotypical behaviours
that appear dependent on the environment. We then discuss our findings in the
context of clinical reports on stereotypical behaviours termed "punding" in
subjects with PD, which consists of stereotypical repetitive and senseless
behaviours. The poor understanding of the pathophysiology governing punding and
consequent lack of effective therapies stand to benefit from enhanced
characterisation of these stereotypical behaviours in a validated pre-clinical
model. We hope that further characterisation of PLBs in the MPTP-lesioned
marmoset will be helpful in the evaluation of interventions that seek to
alleviate PD psychosis symptoms.

A quantitative evaluation of motility is crucial for studies employing
experimental animals. Here, we describe the development of an in-cage motility
monitoring method for new world monkeys using off-the-shelf components, and
demonstrate its capability for long-term operation (e.g., a year). Based on this 
novel system, we characterized the motility of the common marmoset over different
time scales (seconds, hours, days, and weeks). Monitoring of seven young animals 
belonging to two different age groups (sub-adult and young-adult) over a 231-day 
period revealed: (1) strictly diurnal activity (97.3% of movement during
daytime), (2) short-cycle (∼20 s) transition in activity, and (3) bimodal diurnal
activity including a "siesta" break. Additionally, while the mean duration of
short-cycle activity, net daily activity, and diurnal activity changed over the
course of development, 24-h periodicity remained constant. Finally, the method
allowed for detection of progressive motility deterioration in a transgenic
marmoset. Motility measurement offers a convenient way to characterize
developmental and pathological changes in animals, as well as an economical and
labor-free means for long-term evaluation in a wide range of basic and
translational studies.

The accurate and complete assembly of both haplotype sequences of a diploid
organism is essential to understanding the role of variation in genome functions,
phenotypes and diseases1. Here, using a trio-binning approach, we present a
high-quality, diploid reference genome, with both haplotypes assembled
independently at the chromosome level, for the common marmoset (Callithrix
jacchus), an primate model system that is widely used in biomedical research2,3. 
The full spectrum of heterozygosity between the two haplotypes involves 1.36% of 
the genome-much higher than the 0.13% indicated by the standard estimation based 
on single-nucleotide heterozygosity alone. The de novo mutation rate is
0.43 × 10-8 per site per generation, and the paternal inherited genome acquired
twice as many mutations as the maternal. Our diploid assembly enabled us to
discover a recent expansion of the sex-differentiation region and unique
evolutionary changes in the marmoset Y chromosome. In addition, we identified
many genes with signatures of positive selection that might have contributed to
the evolution of Callithrix biological features. Brain-related genes were highly 
conserved between marmosets and humans, although several genes experienced
lineage-specific copy number variations or diversifying selection, with
implications for the use of marmosets as a model system.

The aging of the population and environmental noise have contributed to high
rates of presbycusis, also known as age-related hearing loss (ARHL). Because mice
have a relatively short life span, murine models have not been suitable for
determining the mechanism of presbycusis development and methods of diagnosis.
Although the common marmoset, a non-human primate (NHP), is an ideal animal model
for studying age-related diseases, its auditory spectrum has not been
systematically studied. Auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) from 38 marmosets of 
different ages demonstrated that auditory function correlated with age. Hearing
loss in geriatric common marmosets started at ultra-high frequency (>16 kHz),
then extended to lower frequencies. Despite age-related deterioration of ABR
threshold and amplitude in marmosets, outer hair cell (OHC) function remained
stable at all ages. Spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs), which are the first auditory 
neurons in the auditory system, were found to degenerate distinctly in aged
common marmosets, indicating that neural degeneration caused presbycusis in these
animals. Similarly, age-associated ABR deterioration without loss of OHC function
was observed in another NHP, rhesus monkeys. Audiometry results from these two
species of NHP suggested that NHPs were ideal for studying ARHL and that neural
presbycusis at high frequency may be prevalent in primates.

65. How Might We Get from Genes to Circuits to Disease?.

Therapies [Internet]. Cambridge (MA): MIT Press; 2015. Chapter 8.

Recent advances in the identification of risk genes for psychiatric disorders
have set the stage for functional interrogation of disease related-circuits and
underlying mechanisms of pathophysiology. Still, investigators face significant
challenges: (a) hundreds of genes may contribute to pathogenesis of a given
disorder (polygenicity and genetic heterogeneity), (b) risk alleles may only
cause the disease in combination with other factors (reduced penetrance), and (c)
commonly used rodent models may have significant limitations in studying
psychiatric disorders, due to differences in brain structure and function between
rodents and humans. To address these challenges, high-throughput functional
assays should be developed in combination with induced pluripotent stem cells
(iPSC) technology and novel genome-engineering technologies, as these will help
identify common pathways and mechanisms onto which multiple risk genes may
converge. To overcome limitations of current animal models in psychiatric
research, novel genome-editing technologies provide an opportunity to generate
better animal models (e.g., the common marmoset) to dissect disease-relevant
circuit dysfunction. Finally, powerful new tools (e.g., CLARITY, dense neural
circuit reconstruction, and optogenetics) may help identify and test the
relationship between distinct circuit defects and abnormal behaviors observed in 
these animal models. Such approaches are needed to span the gap between emerging 
genetic information and the symptomatic description of neuropsychiatric
disorders.

The excellent adaptability of Callithrix jacchus to life in captivity presents
advantages in comparison to other nonhuman primates that are used in experimental
models for biomedical research, which explains the increasing scientific interest
in investigating the anatomical characteristics of this species. Owing to the
relative scarcity of publications on the descriptive morphology of the heart of
C. jacchus, the aim of this study was to quantify the presence of collagen in the
left and right ventricular myocardium using modified picrosirius red and acid
fuchsine colorimetric assays. The myocardium of the right ventricle presented a
higher percentage of collagen than that of the left ventricle. No sex-related
differences were observed between the groups. Interestingly, the absolute values 
of collagen were different depending on the method used for quantification
(modified picrosirius red vs. acid fuchsine). The level of collagen
quantification observed in the ventricular myocardium of C. jacchus was similar
to that seen in other nonhuman primates traditionally used in experimental models
of cardiac diseases.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a New World monkey, serves as a useful 
animal model in clinical and basic neuroscience. The present study recorded scalp
auditory evoked potentials (AEP) in non-sedated common marmoset monkeys (n = 4)
using a noninvasive method similar to that used in humans, and aimed to identify 
nonhuman primate correlates of the human AEP components. A pure tone stimulus was
presented while electroencephalograms were recorded using up to 16 disk
electrodes placed on the scalp and earlobes. Candidate homologues of two
categories of the human AEP, namely, the middle latency responses (MLR; Na, Pa,
Nb, and Pb) and the cortical auditory evoked potentials (CAEP; P1, N1, P2, N2,
and the sustained potential, SP) were identified in the marmoset. These waves
were labeled as CjNa, CjPa, CjNb, CjPb, CjP1, CjN1, CjP2, CjN2, and CjSP, where
Cj stands for Callithrix jacchus. The last MLR component, CjPb, was identical to 
the first CAEP component, CjP1, similar to the relationship between Pb and P1 in 
humans. The peak latencies of the marmoset MLR and CAEP were generally shorter
than in humans, which suggests a shorter integration time in neural processing.
To our knowledge, the present study represents the first scalp recorded MLR and
CAEP in the alert common marmoset. Further use of these recording methods would
enable valid species comparisons of homologous brain indices between humans and
animals.

Contraception is an important population control method for the colony management
of primates housed in captivity. Etonogestrel (ENG) implants (i.e., Implanon®)
are a widely used progestin-based contraceptive in common marmosets (Callithrix
jacchus) with the theoretical advantages of being reversible and long-acting.
However, no dose and efficacy data are available yet. Therefore, data from 52
adult female marmosets contracepted with ENG (one-fourth or one-third of an
implant) housed at the Biomedical Primate Research Centre (BPRC, Rijswijk, The
Netherlands) over the past 18 years were analyzed. Using an electronic database, 
a retrospective longitudinal cohort study was conducted to calculate the
reproductive data before, during and after ENG use. The data show an
effectiveness in preventing pregnancy of 99%. The implant was effective within
one week after insertion. Unintended pregnancies did occur, but in 60% of these
cases, the animals were already pregnant at the time of implant insertion. In
these cases, healthy offspring were born despite the use of the implant. No
stillbirths, neonatal deaths or maternal deaths could be linked to ENG use. After
implant removal, 83% of the animals delivered healthy offspring. No difference in
contraception efficacy was observed between the use of one-fourth or one-third of
an implant. ENG achieved a contraceptive protection exceeding 99% and was shown
to be reversible concerning fertility. To our knowledge, this is the first
detailed analysis on the use of ENG in marmosets.

POU class 5 homeobox 1 (POU5F1, also known as OCT4) is critical for maintenance
of pluripotency, germ cell fate, reprogramming into a pluripotent state, and
early embryogenesis. We generated an embryonic stem cell (ESC) line of the common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) harboring a heterozygous knock-in allele of
OCT4-P2A-mCerulean-T2A-pac. The ESC line (CMES40-OC) will be valuable for
investigation of primed/naïve pluripotency and germ cell fate. Homozygous OCT4
knock-in clones were generated but could not be sustained in an undifferentiated 
state in long-term culture. The OCT4 knock-in system facilitated simultaneous
knock-in of a reporter construct at another locus, DDX4 (VASA).

Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are capable of providing an unlimited
source of cells from all three germ layers and germ cells. The derivation and
usage of iPSCs from various animal models may facilitate stem cell-based therapy,
gene-modified animal production, and evolutionary studies assessing interspecies 
differences. However, there is a lack of species-wide methods for deriving iPSCs,
in particular by means of non-viral and non-transgene-integrating (NTI)
approaches. Here, we demonstrate the iPSC derivation from somatic fibroblasts of 
multiple mammalian species from three different taxonomic orders, including the
common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) in Primates, the dog (Canis lupus
familiaris) in Carnivora, and the pig (Sus scrofa) in Cetartiodactyla, by
combinatorial usage of chemical compounds and NTI episomal vectors.
Interestingly, the fibroblasts temporarily acquired a neural stem cell-like state
during the reprogramming. Collectively, our method, robustly applicable to
various species, holds a great potential for facilitating stem cell-based
research using various animals in Mammalia.

A crucial component of social cognition is to observe and understand the social
interactions of other individuals. A promising nonhuman primate model for
investigating the neural basis of social interaction observation is the common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a small New World primate that shares a rich
social repertoire with humans. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance
imaging acquired at 9.4 T to map the brain areas activated by social interaction 
observation in awake marmosets. We discovered a network of subcortical and
cortical areas, predominately in the anterior lateral frontal and medial frontal 
cortex, that was specifically activated by social interaction observation. This
network resembled that recently identified in Old World macaque monkeys. Our
findings suggest that this network is largely conserved between New and Old World
primates and support the use of marmosets for studying the neural basis of social
cognition.

The generation and culture of transgene-free induced pluripotent stem cells
(iPSCs) from the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) present unique challenges
due to the fact that the protocols developed for culture of human or mouse
pluripotent cells are not sufficiently optimized for this particular monkey
species. Here, we describe the procedures for the reprogramming of marmoset fetal
fibroblasts to pluripotency with self-replicating mRNAs using a two-step
approach, where intermediate primary colonies generated in the first
reprogramming step are converted in the second step to iPSCs with customized
marmoset culture medium. The resulting iPSCs are free of transgenes and can be
maintained in long-term culture in feeder-free conditions.

Wasting marmoset syndrome (WMS) is a serious disease in captive common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus) colonies. Because of the high mortality rates, elucidation
of the underlying mechanisms is essential. In this study, we compared the
histopathology, the number of each epithelial cell in the jejunum and colon, and 
the expression patterns of some molecular markers between healthy and
WMS-affected marmosets. Atrophy of villi in the jejunum and mononuclear cell
infiltration in the lamina propria were observed in the intestinal tract of
WMS-affected marmosets. Although the numbers of transient amplifying cells and
tuft cells were increased, the number of goblet cells was obviously decreased in 
the jejunum and colon of WMS-affected marmosets compared to healthy marmosets. In
addition, the number of enterocytes in the jejunum was decreased in WMS animals. 
There was no apparent difference in the numbers of stem cells, enteroendocrine
cells, or Paneth cells. The expression of β-catenin and Tcf7l2 was increased in
WMS, and the co-existence of β-catenin and Tcf7l2/Cyclin D1 was observed around
the crypts in WMS-affected marmosets. These findings suggest that cell
proliferation continues, but cell differentiation is halted in the intestinal
tract due to the enhanced β-catenin/Tcf7l2/Cyclin D1signaling pathway in WMS,
which results in malfunction of the villus and mucosa.

Pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), embryonic stem cells (ESCs), and induced PSCs
(iPSCs) are excellent tools for studying embryonic development in organisms and
classified into naïve and primed states. ESC-derived germline chimera individuals
can be produced by injecting naïve ESCs/iPSCs into preimplantation embryos, and
conversion of primed human ESCs/iPSCs into a naïve state provides insights into
epiblast cell features. Non-human ESCs/iPSCs are alternatives to human naïve
ESCs/iPSCs, which elicit ethical issues. In this study, we used the common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) as an animal model. Since 1996, 16 marmoset ESC
lines have been established. Because most of these ESC lines are female and were 
derived >10 years ago, new ESCs, particularly male marmoset ESC lines, are
needed. Here, we successfully established 17 novel marmoset ESC lines, including 
six male ESC lines from in vitro-fertilized (IVF) embryos and 12 ESC lines under 
feeder-free conditions. This report is the first to establish ESC lines using
feeder-free conditions and IVF preimplantation blastocysts in marmosets, and
these novel ESC lines could potentially facilitate future non-human primate ESC
studies.

Genetic modification of nonhuman primate (NHP) zygotes is a useful method for the
development of NHP models of human diseases. This review summarizes the recent
advances in the development of assisted reproductive and genetic manipulation
techniques in NHP, providing the basis for the generation of genetically modified
NHP disease models. In this study, we review assisted reproductive techniques,
including ovarian stimulation, in vitro maturation of oocytes, in vitro
fertilization, embryo culture, embryo transfer, and intracytoplasmic sperm
injection protocols in marmosets. Furthermore, we review genetic manipulation
techniques, including transgenic strategies, target gene knock-out and knock-in
using gene editing protocols, and newly developed gene-editing approaches that
may potentially impact the production of genetically manipulated NHP models. We
further discuss the progress of assisted reproductive and genetic manipulation
techniques in NHP; future prospects on genetically modified NHP models for
biomedical research are also highlighted.

Genetic modification of non-human primates (NHP) paves the way for realistic
disease models. The common marmoset is a NHP species increasingly used in
biomedical research. Despite the invention of RNA-guided nucleases, one strategy 
for protein overexpression in NHP is still lentiviral transduction. We generated 
three male and one female enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-transgenic
founder marmosets via lentiviral transduction of natural preimplantation embryos.
All founders accomplished germline transmission of the transgene by natural
mating, yielding 20 transgenic offspring together (in total, 45 pups; 44%
transgenic). This demonstrates that the transgenic gametes are capable of natural
fertilization even when in competition with wildtype gametes. Importantly, 90% of
the transgenic offspring showed transgene silencing, which is in sharp contrast
to rodents, where the identical transgene facilitated robust EGFP expression.
Furthermore, we consistently discovered somatic, but so far, no germ cell
chimerism in mixed wildtype/transgenic litters. Somatic cell chimerism resulted
in false-positive genotyping of the respective wildtype littermates. For the
discrimination of transgenic from transgene-chimeric animals by polymerase chain 
reaction on skin samples, a chimeric cell depletion protocol was established. In 
summary, it is possible to establish a cohort of genetically modified marmosets
by natural mating, but specific requirements including careful promoter selection
are essential.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Overweight and obesity are undoubtable risk factors for
type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases and significantly contribute to the
global morbi-mortality. We previoulsy reported that LNP599, a pharmacological
imidazoline-like activator of hepatic AMPK/adiponectin signaling, protects
against the development of adiposity and obesity and the associated
cardio-metabolic disorders, suggesting that it may be a suitable drug candidate
for a therapeutic approach targeting the development of obesity at very early
stages. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the metabolic effects 
of LNP599 in a model of diet-induced overweight and metabolic disorders in a
nonhuman primate, the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), and more particularly
to establish the impact of the compound on cholesterol homeostasis, i.e., HDL and
LDL/VLDL lipoproteins.
METHODS: Marmosets were fed normal (NC) or hypercaloric (HC) chow during 16
weeks. Diet-induced changes in body weight and metabolism were assessed. Effects 
of LNP599 were evaluated in a subset of HC animals (HC-LNP) receiving the
compound at a daily dose of 10 mg/kg over the 16 weeks.
RESULTS: HC-feeding induced significant overweight associated with a marked
dyslipidemia (hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, and reduced HDL over
LDL/VLDL cholesterol ratio). LNP599 blunted the diet-induced body weight gain and
largely protected against the development of hypertriglyceridemia. Total
cholesterol was unchanged but the ratio of HDL over LDL/VLDL cholesterol was more
than doubled.
CONCLUSIONS: The profile of metabolic troubles obtained upon enriched diet
mimicked the disorders associated with spontaneous obesity in marmosets. HC
marmosets represent an experimental model of high clinical relevance to study the
pathophysiology of obesity and related dyslipidemia and to evaluate the effects
of emerging therapies targeting these disorders. Our data confirm the preventing 
effects of LNP599 in a nonhuman primate model and demonstrate for the first time 
the high potency of this drug in promoting HDL-cholesterol.

The use of the common marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus) for neuroscientific
research has grown markedly in the last decade. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
has played a significant role in establishing the extent of comparability of
marmoset brain architecture with the human brain and brains of other preclinical 
species (eg, macaques and rodents). As a non-invasive technique, MRI allows for
the flexible acquisition of the same sequences across different species in vivo, 
including imaging of whole-brain functional topologies not possible with more
invasive techniques. Being one of the smallest New World primates, the marmoset
may be an ideal nonhuman primate species to study with MRI. As primates,
marmosets have an elaborated frontal cortex with features analogous to the human 
brain, while also having a small enough body size to fit into powerful small-bore
MRI systems typically employed for rodent imaging; these systems offer superior
signal strength and resolution. Further, marmosets have a rich behavioral
repertoire uniquely paired with a lissencephalic cortex (like rodents). This
smooth cortical surface lends itself well to MRI and also other invasive
methodologies. With the advent of transgenic modification techniques, marmosets
have gained significant traction as a powerful complement to canonical mammalian 
modelling species. Marmosets are poised to make major contributions to
preclinical investigations of the pathophysiology of human brain disorders as
well as more basic mechanistic explorations of the brain. The goal of this
article is to provide an overview of the practical aspects of implementing MRI
and fMRI in marmosets (both under anesthesia and fully awake) and discuss the
development of resources recently made available for marmoset imaging.

The Gastrointestinal Microbiota of the Common Marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).

The microbiota is heavily involved in both health and disease pathogenesis, but
defining a normal, healthy microbiota in the common marmoset has been
challenging. The aim of this review was to systematically review recent
literature involving the gastrointestinal microbiome of common marmosets in
health and disease. Twelve sources were included in this review. The gut
microbiome composition was reviewed across institutions worldwide, and taxonomic 
shifts between healthy individuals were described. Unlike the human gut
microbiome, which is dominated by Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, the marmoset gut 
microbiome shows great plasticity across institutions, with 5 different phyla
described as dominant in different healthy cohorts. Genera shared across
institutions include Anaerobiospirillum, Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium,
Collinsella, Fusobacterium, Megamonas, Megasphaera, Phascolarctobacterium, and
Prevotella. Shifts in the abundance of Prevotella or Bifidobacterium or invasion 
by pathogens like Clostridium perfringens may be associated with disease. Changes
in microbial composition have been described in healthy and diseased marmosets,
but factors influencing the severe changes in microbial composition have not been
established. Multi-institutional, prospective, and longitudinal studies that
utilize multiple testing methodologies are required to determine sources of
variability in the reporting of marmoset microbiomes. Furthermore, methods of
microbial manipulation, whether by diet, enrichment, fecal microbiome
transplantation, etc, need to be established to modulate and maintain robust and 
resilient microbiome communities in marmoset colonies and reduce the incidence of
idiopathic gastrointestinal disease.

The prevalence of neurodevelopmental psychiatric disorders such as pervasive
developmental disorders is rapidly increasing worldwide. Although these
developmental disorders are known to be influenced by an individual's genetic
background, the potential biological responses to early life's environmental
exposure to both physical and psychological factors must also be considered. Many
studies have acknowledged the influence of shorter time for rest at night and the
simultaneous occurrence of various kinds of complications involving developmental
disorders. In a prior study, we examined how a common marmoset's (Callithrix
jacchus) psychosocial development was affected when it was reared under constant 
daylight from birth and then reared individually by humans nursing them under
constant light (LL) during their juvenile development stages. The behaviors of
these marmosets were compared with those of normal day-night cycle (LD) marmosets
using a multivariate analysis based on principal component analysis (PCA). That
study found that LL marmosets relatively elicited egg-like calls (Ecall) and
side-to-side shakes of the upper body with rapid head rotation through adulthood 
frequently. Based on the PCA, these behaviors were interpreted as "alert" or
"hyperactive" states. However, we did not clarify susceptible periods of the
photic rhythm loss experience and the psychological development output. In this
study we summarize the following studies in our model animal colonies involving
30 animals (11 female, 19 males) to further explore critical age states of
inquiry about each social behavior profiling. We compared social behaviors of
three age stages, juvenile, adolescent and young adult equivalent to one another 
in four LL experience conditions, LL (postnatal day (P) 0 to around 150), Middle 
(P60-149, 90 days), Late (P150-239, 90 days), and LD (no experience). In the most
representative 1st and 2nd principal component scores, the shifting to higher
frequency of alert behaviors developed at the adult stage in LL, Middle, then
Late in turn. The no LL experience group, LD, generally featured higher frequency
of local preference of high position compared to LL experience present groups, in
adulthood. This limited model primate study might inspire different developmental
age sensitive mechanisms of neuronal network to control socio-emotional functions
by utilizing the multivariate visualization method, BOUQUET. This study could
potentially contribute to nurturing educational designs for social developmental 
disorders.

Common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) were shown to be susceptible to
inhalational infection with Coxiella burnetii, in a dose-dependent manner,
producing a disease similar to human Q fever, characterized by a resolving
febrile response. Illness was also associated with weight loss, liver enzyme
dysfunction, characteristic cellular activation, circulating INF-γ and
bacteraemia. Viable C. burnetii was recovered from various tissues during disease
and from 75% of the animal's lungs on 28 days post challenge, when there were no 
overt clinical features of disease but there was histological evidence of
macrophage and lymphocyte infiltration into the lung resulting in granulomatous
alveolitis. Taken together, these features of disease progression, physiology and
bacterial spread appear to be consistent with human disease and therefore the
common marmoset can be considered as a suitable model for studies on the
pathogenesis or the development of medical counter measures of inhalational Q
fever.

The pathological changes underlying gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction in
Parkinson's disease (PD) are poorly understood and the symptoms remain
inadequately treated. In this study we compared the functional and neurochemical 
changes in the enteric nervous system in the colon of adult, L-DOPA-responsive,
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated common marmoset, with
naïve controls. Measurement of mucosal vectorial ion transport, spontaneous
longitudinal smooth muscle activity and immunohistochemical assessment of
intrinsic innervation were each performed in discrete colonic regions of naïve
and MPTP-treated marmosets. The basal short circuit current (Isc) was lower in
MPTP-treated colonic mucosa while mucosal resistance was unchanged. There was no 
difference in basal cholinergic tone, however, there was an increased excitatory 
cholinergic response in MPTP-treated tissues when NOS was blocked with
L-Nω-nitroarginine. The amplitude and frequency of spontaneous contractions in
longitudinal smooth muscle as well as carbachol-evoked post-junctional
contractile responses were unaltered, despite a decrease in choline
acetyltransferase and an increase in the vasoactive intestinal polypeptide neuron
numbers per ganglion in the proximal colon. There was a low-level inflammation in
the proximal but not the distal colon accompanied by a change in α-synuclein
immunoreactivity. This study suggests that MPTP treatment produces long-term
alterations in colonic mucosal function associated with amplified muscarinic
mucosal activity but decreased cholinergic innervation in myenteric plexi and
increased nitrergic enteric neurotransmission. This suggests that long-term
changes in either central or peripheral dopaminergic neurotransmission may lead
to adaptive changes in colonic function resulting in alterations in ion transport
across mucosal epithelia that may result in GI dysfunction in PD.

We previously reported the efficient targeted introduction of transgenes into the
genomic DNA of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) using CRISPR-Cas9. In
this study, we generated a marmoset embryonic stem cell (ESC) line that
ubiquitously expresses the tamoxifen-inducible Cre-driver ERT2CreERT2. We
validated the pluripotency of the ESC line and also successfully demonstrated the
temporal control of the Cre-driver in a tamoxifen-dependent manner in the ESCs.
This ESC line, named ActiCre-B1, will be a valuable resource for in vitro
investigation of phenotypes related to embryonic lethality by targeted knockout
of functionally important genes.

Social tolerance in a group reflects the balance between within-group competition
and interdependence: whereas increased competition leads to a reduction in social
tolerance, increased interdependence increases it. Captivity reduces both feeding
competition and interdependence and can therefore affect social tolerance. In
independently breeding primates, social tolerance has been shown to be higher in 
captivity, indicating a strong effect of food abundance. It is not known,
however, how social tolerance in cooperative breeders, with their much higher
interdependence, responds to captivity. Here, we therefore compared social
tolerance between free-ranging and captive groups in the cooperatively breeding
common marmoset and found higher social tolerance (measured as proximity near
food, co-feeding, and food sharing) in the wild. Most likely, social tolerance in
the wild is higher because interdependence is particularly high in the wild,
especially because infant care is more costly there than in captivity. These
results indicate that the high social tolerance of these cooperative breeders in 
captivity is not an artefact, and that captive data may even have underestimated 
it. They may also imply that the cooperative breeding and foraging of our hominin
ancestors, which relied on strong interdependence at multiple levels, was
associated with high social tolerance.

The brain is a complex network of interconnected and interacting neuronal
populations. Global efforts to understand the emergence of behavior and the
effect of perturbations depend on accurate reconstruction of white matter
pathways, both in humans and in model organisms. An emerging animal model for
next-generation applied neuroscience is the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).
A recent open respository of retrograde and anterograde tract tracing presents an
opportunity to systematically study the network architecture of the marmoset
brain (Marmoset Brain Architecture Project; http://www.marmosetbrain.org). Here
we comprehensively chart the topological organization of the mesoscale marmoset
cortico-cortical connectome. The network possesses multiple nonrandom attributes 
that promote a balance between segregation and integration, including
near-minimal path length, multiscale community structure, a connective core, a
unique motif composition, and multiple cavities. Altogether, these structural
attributes suggest a link between network architecture and function. Our findings
are consistent with previous reports across a range of species, scales, and
reconstruction technologies, suggesting a small set of organizational principles 
universal across phylogeny. Collectively, these results provide a foundation for 
future anatomical, functional, and behavioral studies in this model organism.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) has attracted considerable attention,
especially in the biomedical science and neuroscience research fields, because of
its potential to recapitulate the complex and multidimensional phenotypes of
human diseases, and several neurodegenerative transgenic models have been
reported. However, there remain several issues as (i) it takes years to generate 
late-onset disease models, and (ii) the onset age and severity of phenotypes can 
vary among individuals due to differences in genetic background. In the present
study, we established an efficient and rapid direct neuronal induction method
(induced neurons; iNs) from embryonic and adult marmoset fibroblasts to
investigate cellular-level phenotypes in the marmoset brain in vitro. We
overexpressed reprogramming effectors, i.e., microRNA-9/9*, microRNA-124, and
Achaete-Scute family bHLH transcription factor 1, in fibroblasts with a small
molecule cocktail that facilitates neuronal induction. The resultant iNs from
embryonic and adult marmoset fibroblasts showed neuronal characteristics within
two weeks, including neuron-specific gene expression and spontaneous neuronal
activity. As directly reprogrammed neurons have been shown to model
neurodegenerative disorders, the neuronal reprogramming of marmoset fibroblasts
may offer new tools for investigating neurological phenotypes associated with
disease progression in non-human primate neurological disease models.

The marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus) has gained attention in neurophysiology 
research as a new primate model for visual processing and behavior. In
particular, marmosets have a lissencephalic cortex, making multielectrode,
optogenetic, and calcium-imaging techniques more accessible than other primate
models. However, the degree of homology of brain circuits for visual behavior
with those identified in macaques and humans is still being ascertained. For
example, whereas the location of the frontal eye fields (FEF) within the
dorsolateral frontal cortex has been proposed, it remains unclear whether neurons
in the corresponding areas show visual responses-an important characteristic of
FEF neurons in other species. Here, we provide the first description of receptive
field properties and neural response latencies in the marmoset dorsolateral
frontal cortex, based on recordings using Utah arrays in anesthetized animals. We
find brisk visual responses in specific regions of the dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex, particularly in areas 8aV, 8C, and 6DR. As in macaque FEF, the receptive 
fields were typically large (10°-30° in diameter) and the median responses
latency was brisk (60 ms). These results constrain the possible interpretations
about the location of the marmoset FEF and suggest that the marmoset model's
significant advantages for the use of physiological techniques may be leveraged
in the study of visuomotor cognition.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Behavior and cognition in
humans and other primates rely on networks of brain areas guided by the frontal
cortex. The marmoset offers exciting new opportunities to study links between
brain physiology and behavior, but the functions of frontal cortex areas are
still being identified in this species. Here, we provide the first evidence of
visual receptive fields in the marmoset dorsolateral frontal cortex, an important
step toward future studies of visual cognitive behavior.

The standard anatomical brain template provides a common space and coordinate
system for visualizing and analyzing neuroimaging data from large cohorts of
subjects. Previous templates and atlases for the common marmoset brain were
either based on data from a single individual or lacked essential functionalities
for neuroimaging analysis. Here, we present new population-based in-vivo standard
templates and tools derived from multi-modal data of 27 marmosets, including
multiple types of T1w and T2w contrast images, DTI contrasts, and large
field-of-view MRI and CT images. We performed multi-atlas labeling of anatomical 
structures on the new templates and constructed highly accurate tissue-type
segmentation maps to facilitate volumetric studies. We built fully featured brain
surfaces and cortical flat maps to facilitate 3D visualization and surface-based 
analyses, which are compatible with most surface analyzing tools, including
FreeSurfer, AFNI/SUMA, and the Connectome Workbench. Analysis of the MRI and CT
datasets revealed significant variations in brain shapes, sizes, and regional
volumes of brain structures, highlighting substantial individual variabilities in
the marmoset population. Thus, our population-based template and associated tools
provide a versatile analysis platform and standard coordinate system for a wide
range of MRI and connectome studies of common marmosets. These new template tools
comprise version 3 of our Marmoset Brain Mapping Project and are publicly
available via marmosetbrainmapping.org/v3.html.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common cause of cancer-related deaths largely due to
CRC liver metastasis (CRLM). Identification of targetable mechanisms continues
and includes investigations into the role of inflammatory pathways. Of interest, 
MAPK is aberrantly expressed in CRC patients, yet the activation status is not
defined. The present study assessed p38γ activation in CRC patients, cancer
cells, and tissues of cotton top tamarin (CTT) and common marmoset (CM). The
primate world is an overlooked resource as colitis-CRC-prone CTT are usually
inure to liver metastasis while CM develop colitis but not CRC. The results
demonstrate that p38γ protein and phosphorylation levels are significantly
increased in CRC patients compared to normal subjects and CTT. Furthermore, p38γ 
phosphorylation is significantly elevated in human CRC cells and hepatoblastoma
cells but not in CM colon. Additionally, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and
biliary glycoprotein (BGP) are induced in the CRC patients that showed p38γ
phosphorylation. Inhibition of p38 MAPK in CRC cells showed a significant decline
in cell growth with no effect on apoptosis or BGP level. Overall, p38γ is
activated in CRC tumorigenesis and likely involves CEA antigens during CRLM in
humans but not in the CTT or CM, that rarely develop CRLM.

Given their genetic and anatomic similarities to humans, nonhuman primates (NHPs)
may serve as animal models for urogenital diseases of humans. The purpose of this
study was to examine the frequency of spontaneous urogenital lesions occurring
over a 30-year period at the Yerkes and Southwest National Primate Research
Centers and to compare and contrast lesions occurring in Old World versus New
World primates. Lesions occurring in the chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), baboon
(Papio spp.), rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta), cynomolgus macaque (Macaca
fascicularis), pig-tailed macaque (Macaca nemestrina), sooty mangabey (Cercocebus
atys), common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), cotton-top tamarin (Sanguinus
oedipus), and squirrel monkey (Saimiri sciureus) are discussed. The most common
lesions of the kidney were medullary amyloidosis, renal cysts, renal tubular
degeneration, glomerulonephritis or glomerulopathy, nephritis, nephrocalcinosis, 
pyelonephritis, and hydronephrosis. Specific causes of renal tubular disease
included pigmentary nephrosis and tubular lipidosis. Renal tumors, including
renal adenoma and carcinoma, lymphoma, and nephroblastoma, were infrequent
diagnoses in all species. Endometriosis was the most frequently diagnosed lesion 
of the female genital tract. Of the animals examined in this study, it was most
frequent in Old World primates. Leiomyoma was the most common uterine tumor.
Granulosa cell tumor was the most frequently observed neoplasm of the ovaries,
followed by teratoma. Of animals included in the study, most ovarian tumors
occurred in baboons. Neoplasms of the male reproductive tract included
interstitial cell tumor, seminoma, penile squamous cell carcinoma, penile
papilloma, and histiocytoma. In New World monkeys, renal lesions were reported
more frequently than genital lesions.

HLA-F represents one of the nonclassical MHC class I molecules in humans. Its
main characteristics involve low levels of polymorphism in combination with a
restricted tissue distribution. This signals that the gene product executes a
specialised function, which, however, is still poorly understood. Relatively
little is known about the evolutionary equivalents of this gene in nonhuman
primates, especially with regard to population data. Here we report a comparative
genetic analysis of the orthologous genes of HLA-F in various great ape, Old
World monkey (OWM), and New World monkey (NWM) species. HLA-F-related transcripts
were found in all subjects studied. Low levels of polymorphism were encountered, 
although the length of the predicted gene products may vary. In most species, one
or two transcripts were discovered, indicating the presence of only one active
F-like gene per chromosome. An exception was provided by a New World monkey
species, namely, the common marmoset. In this species, the gene has been subject 
to duplication, giving rise to up to six F-like transcripts per animal. In
humans, great apes, and OWM, and probably the majority of the NWM species, the
evolutionary equivalents of the HLA-F gene experienced purifying selection. In
the marmoset, however, the gene was initially duplicated, but the expansion was
subjected afterwards to various mechanisms of genetic inactivation, as evidenced 
by the presence of pseudogenes and an array of genetic artefacts in a section of 
the transcripts.

Plasma concentrations of acetaminophen, its glucuronide and sulfate conjugates,
and cysteinyl acetaminophen were experimentally determined after oral
administrations of 10 mg/kg in humanised-liver mice, control mice, rats, common
marmosets, cynomolgus monkeys, and minipigs; the results were compared with
reported human pharmacokinetic data. Among the animals tested, only rats
predominantly converted acetaminophen to sulfate conjugates, rather than
glucuronide conjugates. In contrast, the values of area under the plasma
concentration curves of acetaminophen, its glucuronide and sulfate conjugates,
and cysteinyl acetaminophen after oral administration of acetaminophen in
marmosets and minipigs were consistent with those reported in humans under the
present conditions. Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models
(consisting of the gut, liver, and central compartments) for acetaminophen and
its primary metabolite could reproduce and estimate, respectively, the plasma and
hepatic concentrations of acetaminophen in experimental animals and humans after 
single virtual oral doses. The values of area under the curves of hepatic
concentrations of acetaminophen estimated using PBPK models were correlated with 
the measured levels of cysteinyl acetaminophen (a deactivated metabolite) in
plasma fractions in these species. Consequently, using simple PBPK models and
plasma data to predict hepatic chemical concentrations after oral doses could be 
helpful as an indicator of in vivo possible hepatotoxicity of chemicals such as
acetaminophen.

Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) hold enormous potential for the
development of cell-based therapies; however, the safety and efficacy of
potential iPSC-based treatments need to be verified in relevant animal disease

CHIR99021 and SB431542, we first established intermediate primary colonies with
neural progenitor-like properties. In the second reprogramming step, we converted
these colonies into transgene-free pluripotent stem cells by further culturing
them with customized marmoset iPSC medium in feeder-free conditions. Our
experiments revealed a novel paradigm for flexible reprogramming of somatic
cells, where primary colonies obtained by a single VEE-mRNA transfection can be
directed either toward the neural lineage or further reprogrammed to
pluripotency. These results (1) will further enhance the role of the common
marmoset as animal disease model for preclinical testing of iPSC-based therapies 
and (2) establish an in vitro system to experimentally address developmental
signal transduction pathways in primates.

Animal models of human pregnancy and placentation: alternatives to the mouse.

of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark.

The mouse is often criticized as a model for pregnancy research as gestation is
short, with much of organ development completed postnatally. There are also
differences in the structure and physiology of the placenta between mouse and
human. This review considers eight alternative models that recently have been
proposed and two established ones that seem underutilized. A promising newcomer
among rodents is the spiny mouse, which has a longer gestation than the mouse
with organogenesis complete at birth. The guinea pig is also recommended both
because it has well-developed neonates and because there is a wealth of
information on pregnancy and placentation in the literature. Several smaller
primates are considered. The mouse lemur has its advocates yet is less suited as 
a model for human pregnancy as its young are altricial, placentation very
different from that of humans, and husbandry requirements not fully assessed. In 
contrast, the common marmoset, a New World monkey, has well-developed neonates
and is kept at many primate centres. Marmoset placenta has some features that
closely resemble human placentation, such as the interhaemal barrier, although it
is uncertain if invasion of the uterine arteries occurs in this species. In
conclusion, pregnancy research would benefit greatly from increased use of
alternative models such as the spiny mouse and common marmoset.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a small-bodied New World primate that
is becoming an important model to study brain functions. Despite several studies 
exploring the somatosensory system of marmosets, all results have come from
anesthetized animals using invasive techniques and postmortem analyses. Here, we 
demonstrate the feasibility for getting high-quality and reproducible
somatosensory mapping in awake marmosets with functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI). We acquired fMRI sequences in four animals, while they received
tactile stimulation (via air-puffs), delivered to the face, arm, or leg. We found
a topographic body representation with the leg representation in the most medial 
part, the face representation in the most lateral part, and the arm
representation between leg and face representation within areas 3a, 3b, and 1/2. 
A similar sequence from leg to face from caudal to rostral sites was identified
in areas S2 and PV. By generating functional connectivity maps of seeds defined
in the primary and second somatosensory regions, we identified two clusters of
tactile representation within the posterior and midcingulate cortex. However,
unlike humans and macaques, no clear somatotopic maps were observed. At the
subcortical level, we found a somatotopic body representation in the thalamus
and, for the first time in marmosets, in the putamen. These maps have similar
organizations, as those previously found in Old World macaque monkeys and humans,
suggesting that these subcortical somatotopic organizations were already
established before Old and New World primates diverged. Our results show the
first whole brain mapping of somatosensory responses acquired in a noninvasive
way in awake marmosets.NEW & NOTEWORTHY We used somatosensory stimulation
combined with functional MRI (fMRI) in awake marmosets to reveal the topographic 
body representation in areas S1, S2, thalamus, and putamen. We showed the
existence of a body representation organization within the thalamus and the
cingulate cortex by computing functional connectivity maps from seeds defined in 
S1/S2, using resting-state fMRI data. This noninvasive approach will be essential
for chronic studies by guiding invasive recording and manipulation techniques.

Understanding the similarity of cortico-subcortical networks topologies between
humans and nonhuman primate species is critical to study the origin of network
alternations underlying human neurologic and neuropsychiatric diseases. The New
World common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) has become popular as a nonhuman
primate model for human brain function. Most marmoset connectomic research,
however, has exclusively focused on cortical areas, with connectivity to
subcortical networks less extensively explored. Here, we aimed to first isolate
patterns of subcortical connectivity with cortical resting-state networks in
awake marmosets using resting-state fMRI, then to compare these networks with
those in humans using connectivity fingerprinting. In this study, we used 5
marmosets (4 males, 1 female). While we could match several marmoset and human
resting-state networks based on their functional fingerprints, we also found a
few striking differences, for example, strong functional connectivity of the
default mode network with the superior colliculus in marmosets that was much
weaker in humans. Together, these findings demonstrate that many of the core
cortico-subcortical networks in humans are also present in marmosets, but that
small, potentially functionally relevant differences exist.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT
The common marmoset is becoming increasingly popular as an additional preclinical
nonhuman primate model for human brain function. Here we compared the functional 
organization of cortico-subcortical networks in marmosets and humans using
ultra-high field fMRI. We isolated the patterns of subcortical connectivity with 
cortical resting-state networks (RSNs) in awake marmosets using resting-state
fMRI and then compared these networks with those in humans using connectivity
fingerprinting. While we could match several marmoset and human RSNs based on
their functional fingerprints, we also found several striking differences.
Together, these findings demonstrate that many of the core cortico-subcortical
RSNs in humans are also present in marmosets, but that small, potentially
functionally relevant differences exist.

Animal models are indispensable tools in the development of innovative treatments
for rare and incurable diseases. To date, there is almost no effective treatment 
for neurodegenerative diseases, and animal models that properly simulate human
disease pathologies are eagerly anticipated to identify disease biomarkers and
develop therapeutic methods and agents. Among experimental animals, non-human
primates are the most suitable animal models for the study of neurodegenerative
diseases with human-specific higher brain dysfunction and late-onset and slowly
progressing symptoms. With the rapid development of novel therapies such as
oligonucleotide therapeutics and genome editing technologies, non-human primate
models for neurodegenerative diseases will be essential for preclinical studies
and active interventional trials. In a previous publication, we reported the
generation of the first transgenic marmoset model of spinocerebellar ataxia type 
3 and successful obtainment of subsequent generations with stable disease onset. 
Moreover, we generated transgenic marmosets in which the transgene was controlled
by the tetracycline-inducible gene expression system. In this mini-review, we
summarize the research on our marmoset model of spinocerebellar ataxia type 3.

The ability to generate in vitro cultures of neuronal cells has been instrumental
in advancing our understanding of the nervous system. Rodent models have been the
principal source of brain cells used in primary cultures for over a century,
providing insights that are widely applicable to human diseases. However,
therapeutic agents that showed benefit in rodent models, particularly those
pertaining to aging and age-associated dementias, have frequently failed in
clinical trials. This discrepancy established a potential "translational gap"
between human and rodent studies that may at least partially be explained by the 
phylogenetic distance between rodent and primate species. Several non-human
primate (NHP) species, including the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), have
been used extensively in neuroscience research, but in contrast to rodent models,
practical approaches to the generation of primary cell culture systems amenable
to molecular studies that can inform in vivo studies are lacking. Marmosets are a
powerful model in biomedical research and particularly in studies of aging and
age-associated diseases because they exhibit an aging phenotype similar to
humans. Here, we report a practical method to culture primary marmoset neurons
and astrocytes from brains of medically euthanized postnatal day 0 (P0) marmoset 
newborns that yield highly pure primary neuron and astrocyte cultures. Primary
marmoset neuron and astrocyte cultures can be generated reliably to provide a
powerful NHP in vitro model in neuroscience research that may enable mechanistic 
studies of nervous system aging and of age-related neurodegenerative disorders.
Because neuron and astrocyte cultures can be used in combination with in vivo
approaches in marmosets, primary marmoset neuron and astrocyte cultures may help 
bridge the current translational gap between basic and clinical studies in
nervous system aging and age-associated neurological diseases.

BACKGROUND: Callithrix jacchus, it is a species highly targeted by wild animal
traffickers and, when apprehended, they need veterinary care. For safe
therapeutic procedures, knowledge of anatomy is essential, as well as for
diagnostic by imaging, good radiographic positioning is essential.
METHODS: The anatomy of the paranasal sinuses and the radiographic projections
was described using 10 carcasses of common marmosets. Radiographs were taken in
two panoramic views of their head: profile and frontal-naso. For the anatomical
study, paramedian and transverse macroscopic sections and microscopic transverse 
sections were performed.
RESULTS: On the radiographs, it was possible to identify the frontal recess and
maxillary sinuses in profile and frontal-naso incidences. In the anatomical
study, the frontal recess and maxillary, sphenoid and ethmoid paranasal sinuses
were identified.
CONCLUSIONS: The ethmoidal sinus could be observed only microscopically and the
sphenoidal sinus difficult to see on the radiography due to the overlapping
adjoining structures.

From 2010 to 2015, 73 common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) housed at the
Wisconsin National Primate Research Center (WNPRC) were diagnosed postmortem with
lymphocytic enterocolitis. We used unbiased deep-sequencing to screen the blood
of deceased enterocolitis-positive marmosets for viruses. In five out of eight
common marmosets with lymphocytic enterocolitis, we discovered a novel pegivirus 
not present in ten matched, clinically normal controls. The novel virus, which we
named Southwest bike trail virus (SOBV), is most closely related (68% nucleotide 
identity) to a strain of simian pegivirus A isolated from a three-striped night
monkey (Aotus trivirgatus). We screened 146 living WNPRC common marmosets for
SOBV, finding an overall prevalence of 34% (50/146). Over four years, 85 of these
146 animals died or were euthanized. Histological examination revealed 27
SOBV-positive marmosets from this cohort had lymphocytic enterocolitis, compared 
to 42 SOBV-negative marmosets, indicating no association between SOBV and disease
in this cohort (p = 0.0798). We also detected SOBV in two of 33 (6%) clinically
normal marmosets screened during transfer from the New England Primate Research
Center, suggesting SOBV could be exerting confounding influences on comparisons
of common marmoset studies from multiple colonies.

In humans and macaque monkeys, socially relevant face processing is accomplished 
via a distributed functional network that includes specialized patches in frontal
cortex. It is unclear whether a similar network exists in New World primates, who
diverged ~35 million years from Old World primates. The common marmoset is a New 
World primate species ideally placed to address this question given their complex
social repertoire. Here, we demonstrate the existence of a putative high-level
face processing network in marmosets. Like Old World primates, marmosets show
differential activation in anterior cingulate and lateral prefrontal cortices
while they view socially relevant videos of marmoset faces. We corroborate the
locations of these frontal regions by demonstrating functional and structural
connectivity between these regions and temporal lobe face patches. Given the
evolutionary separation between macaques and marmosets, our results suggest this 
frontal network specialized for social face processing predates the separation
between Platyrrhini and Catarrhini.

Effects of Ketamine Administration on Auditory Information Processing in the
Neocortex of Nonhuman Primates.

Ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, exerts broad
effects on consciousness and perception. Since NMDA receptor antagonists induce
cognitive impairments, ketamine has been used for translational research on
several psychiatric diseases, such as schizophrenia. Whereas the effects of
ketamine on cognitive functions have been extensively studied, studies on the
effects of ketamine on simple sensory information processing remain limited. In
this study, we investigated the cortex-wide effects of ketamine administration on
auditory information processing in nonhuman primates using whole-cortical
electrocorticography (ECoG). We first recorded ECoG from awake monkeys on
presenting auditory stimuli of different frequencies or different durations. We
observed auditory evoked responses (AERs) across the cortex, including in
frontal, parietal, and temporal areas, while feature-specific responses were
obtained around the temporal sulcus. Next, we examined the effects of ketamine on
cortical auditory information processing. We conducted ECoG recordings from
monkeys that had been administered anesthetic doses of ketamine from 10 to
180 min following administration. We observed significant changes in stimulus
feature-specific responses. Electrodes showing a frequency preference or offset
responses were altered following ketamine administration, while those of the AERs
were not strongly influenced. However, the frequency preference of a selected
electrode was not significantly altered by ketamine administration over time
following administration, while the imbalances in the onset and offset persisted 
over the course of 150 min following ketamine administration in all three
monkeys. These results suggest that ketamine affects the ability to distinguish
between sound frequency and duration in different ways. In conclusion, future
research on the NMDA sensitivity of cortical wide sensory information processing 
may provide a new perspective into the development of nonhuman primate models of 
psychiatric disorders.

The use of home-based image sensors for biological and environmental monitoring
provides novel insight into health and development but it is difficult to
evaluate people during their normal activities in their home. Therefore, we
developed a low-cost infrared (IR) technology-based motion, location, temperature
and thermal environment detection system that can be used non-invasively for
long-term studies in the home environment. We tested this technology along with
the associated analysis algorithm to visualize the effects of parental care and
thermal environment on developmental state change in a non-human primate model,
the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). To validate this system, we first
compared it to a manual analysis technique and we then assessed the development
of circadian rhythms in common marmosets from postnatal day 15-45. The
semi-automatically tracked biological indices of locomotion velocity (BV) and
body surface temperature (BT) and the potential psychological index of place
preference toward the door (BD), showed age-dependent shifts in circadian phase
patterns. Although environmental variables appeared to affect circadian rhythm
development, principal component analysis and signal superimposing imaging
methods revealed a novel phasic pattern of BD-BT correlation day/night switching 
in animals older than postnatal day 38 (approximately equivalent to one year of
age in humans). The origin of this switch was related to earlier development of
body temperature (BT) rhythms and alteration of psychological behavior rhythms
(BD) around earlier feeding times. We propose that this cost-effective, inclusive
sensing and analytic technique has value for understanding developmental care
conditions for which continual home non-invasive monitoring would be beneficial
and further suggest the potential to adapt this technique for use in humans.

The ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) is a key brain structure implicated in
mood and anxiety disorders, based primarily on evidence from correlational
neuroimaging studies. Composed of a number of brain regions with distinct
architecture and connectivity, dissecting its functional heterogeneity will
provide key insights into the symptomatology of these disorders. Focusing on area
14, lying on the medial and orbital surfaces of the gyrus rectus, this study
addresses a key question of causality. Do changes in area 14 activity induce
changes in threat- and reward-elicited responses within the nonhuman primate, the
common marmoset, similar to that seen in mood and anxiety disorders? Area 14
overactivation was found to induce heightened responsivity to uncertain,
low-imminence threat while blunting cardiovascular and behavioral anticipatory
arousal to high-value food reward. Conversely, inactivation enhanced the arousal 
to high-value reward cues while dampening the acquisition of cardiovascular and
behavioral responses to a Pavlovian threat cue. Basal cardiovascular activity,
including heart rate variability and sympathovagal balance, which are
dysfunctional in mood and anxiety disorders, are insensitive to alterations in
area 14 activity as is the extinction of conditioned threat responses. The
distinct pattern of dysregulation compared to neighboring region area 25
highlights the heterogeneity of function within vmPFC and reveals how the effects
of area 14 overactivation on positive and negative reactivity mirror symptoms of 
anhedonia and anxiety that are so often comorbid in mood disorders.

Staphylococcal enterotoxins (SEs) are extracellular proteins, produced mainly by 
Staphylococcus aureus, which cause staphylococcal food poisoning (SFP) when
ingested. Here, a novel SE was identified from two strains, which were identified
as the causative microbes of the SFP outbreak that occurred in Tokyo in 2004.
Both strains harbored the SEA gene, but its production was lower than that of
other SEA-producing SFP isolates. Whole-genome sequencing analysis demonstrated
that both strains harbored a SE-like gene besides sea. Phylogenetic analysis
revealed that the amino acid sequence deduced from the SE-like gene belonged to
the SEB group. Therefore, this gene was presumed to be a novel SE gene and termed
"SE02." The stability of SE02 against heating and proteolytic digestions was a
little different from that of SEA. SE02 has both superantigenic and emetic
bioactivities. Namely, SE02 activated mouse splenocytes and exhibited emetic
activity in the common marmoset. SE02 mRNA was highly expressed in both isolates 
during the exponential phase of cultivation. In addition, SE02 protein was
produced at 20 °C and 25 °C, which reflects the actual situation of SFP. SE02
appears to be a novel emetic toxin that was likely the causative toxin in
combination with SEA in the SFP outbreak.

The role by which the gut microbiome influences host health (e.g., energy
equilibrium and immune system) may be partly mediated by short-chain fatty acids,
which are bacterial fermentation products from the dietary fibers. However,
little is known about longitudinal changes in gut microbiome metabolites during
cohabitation alongside social contact. In common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus), 
the gut microbiome community is influenced by social contact, as newly paired
males and females develop convergent microbial profiles. Here, we monitored the
dynamics of short-chain fatty acid concentrations in common marmoset feces from
the prepairing (PRE) to postpairing (POST) stages. In males, we observed that the
concentrations of acetate, propionate, isobutyrate, and isovalerate significantly
increased in the POST stage compared to the PRE stage. However, no significant
changes were found in females. We further found that the propionate concentration
was significantly positively correlated with the abundance of
Phascolarctobacterium in the male feces. Thus, the sex difference in the changes 
in the concentrations of short-chain fatty acids might be related to sex-biased
gut microbiome transmission after pairing. We suggest that the significant
changes in the gut microbiomes and some short-chain fatty acids of the common
marmoset during cohabitation may contribute to physiological homeostasis during
pairing.IMPORTANCE This study addressed a knowledge gap about longitudinal
changes in the gut microbiome metabolites during animal pairing. This research in
the laboratory common marmoset can control for the confounding factors such as
diet and other environmental conditions. Phascolarctobacterium showed the highest
contribution to the sex-biased transmission of the female to the male after
pairing. Here, we observed the sex difference in the increase in short-chain
fatty acid concentration in the feces of newly paired marmosets, which may be
caused by the sex-biased gut microbiome transmission after pairing.

Cortical lesions are a primary driver of disability in multiple sclerosis (MS).
However, noninvasive detection of cortical lesions with in vivo magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) remains challenging. Experimental autoimmune
encephalomyelitis (EAE) in the common marmoset is a relevant animal model of MS
for investigating the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to brain damage. This
study aimed to characterize cortical lesions in marmosets with EAE using
ultrahigh-field (7 T) MRI and histological analysis. Tissue preparation was
optimized to enable the acquisition of high-spatial resolution (50-μm isotropic) 
T2*-weighted images. A total of 14 animals were scanned in this study, and 70% of
the diseased animals presented at least one cortical lesion on postmortem
imaging. Cortical lesions identified on MRI were verified with myelin proteolipid
protein immunostaining. An optimized T2*-weighted sequence was developed for in
vivo imaging and shown to capture 65% of cortical lesions detected postmortem.
Immunostaining confirmed extensive demyelination with preserved neuronal somata
in several cortical areas of EAE animals. Overall, this study demonstrates the
relevance and feasibility of the marmoset EAE model to study cortical lesions,
among the most important yet least understood features of MS.

The objectives of this study were (a) to establish a population pharmacokinetic
model and (b) to investigate the clinical and physiological effects of a single
bolus dose of propofol in common marmosets. In Study 1, pharmacokinetic analysis 
was performed in six marmosets under sevoflurane anaesthesia. 8 mg/kg of propofol
was administrated at a rate of 4 mg kg-1  min-1 . Blood samples were collected 2,
5, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120 or 180 min after starting propofol administration. Plasma 
concentration was measured, and population pharmacokinetic modelling was
performed. A two-compartment model was selected as the final model. The
population pharmacokinetic parameters were as follows: V1  = 1.14 L, V2  = 77.6
L, CL1  = 0.00182 L/min, CL2  = 0.0461 L/min. In Study 2, clinical and
physiological parameters were assessed and recorded every 2 min after 12 mg/kg of
propofol was administrated at a rate of 4 mg kg-1  min-1 . Immobilization was
sustained for 5 min following propofol administration without apparent
bradycardia. While combination of propofol and sevoflurane caused apnoea in Study
1, apnoea was not observed following single administration of propofol in Study
2. These data provide bases for further investigation on intravenous anaesthesia 
using propofol in common marmosets.

The pulvinar, the largest thalamic nucleus in the primate brain, has connections 
with a variety of cortical areas and is involved in many aspects of higher brain 
functions. Among cortico-pulvino-cortical systems, the connection between the
middle temporal area (MT) and the pulvinar has been thought to contribute
significantly to complex motion recognition. Recently, the common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus), has become a valuable model for a variety of neuroscience
studies, including visual neuroscience and translational research of neurological
and psychiatric disorders. However, information on projections from MT to the
pulvinar in the marmoset brain is scant. We addressed this deficiency by
injecting sensitive anterograde viral tracers into MT to examine the distribution
of labeled terminations in the pulvinar. The injection sites were placed
retinotopically according to visual field coordinates mapped by optical intrinsic
imaging. All injections produced anterograde terminal labeling, which was densest
in the medial nucleus of the inferior pulvinar (PIm), sparser in the central
nucleus of the inferior pulvinar, and weakest in the lateral pulvinar. Within
each subnucleus, terminations formed separate retinotopic fields. Most labeled
terminals were small but these comingled with a few large terminals, distributed 
mainly in the dorsomedial part of the PIm. Our results further delineate the
organization of projections from MT to the pulvinar in the marmoset as forming
parallel complex networks, which may differentially contribute to motion
processing. It is interesting that the densest projections from MT target the
PIm, the subnucleus recently reported to preferentially receive direct retinal
projections.

There is limited available information concerning the prevalence of Toxoplasma
gondii in noncaptive monkeys. Also, New World monkeys (NWM) are highly
susceptible to toxoplasmosis, which is a conservation concern. This study aimed
to investigate apicomplexan parasites in common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus)
collected for yellow fever and rabies surveillance program in Northeastern region
of Brazil. Heart fragments of 39 free-ranging common marmosets were analyzed for 
the presence of the 18S rDNA gene of apicomplexan parasites by nested PCR.
Positive samples were sequenced. T. gondii DNA was detected in 17.9% (7/39) of
the analyzed animals. This study is the first report on T. gondii in Callithrix
jacchus in Brazil. These findings should be an alert for wildlife conservation
institutions, as high susceptibility and mortality were reported for captive NWM.

The 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-lesioned common marmoset 
has been used extensively to model Parkinson's disease,
L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA)-induced dyskinesia and, more recently,
dopaminergic psychosis. Whereas several experimental drugs have been tested in
this primate, many of which subsequently underwent clinical trials, efficacy
thresholds in the marmoset that would predict efficacy in the clinic are lacking.
Here, we aimed to determine such efficacy end points that would be indicative of 
likely efficacy in clinical studies. To do so, we used the evidence-based
medicine reviews published by the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder
Society (IPMDS) to select drugs that were rated as clinically efficacious, likely
efficacious or not efficacious for the treatment of parkinsonism, dyskinesia and 
psychosis. We then reviewed the literature in the MPTP-lesioned marmoset and
identified articles reporting the effects of drugs that were included in the
IPMDS recommendations, following which we estimated efficacy thresholds in the
marmoset that would predict efficacy at the clinical level. We propose that, when
drugs are administered as monotherapy, ≥ 50% reduction of global parkinsonism may
be necessary to predict the possibility of clinical efficacy. As adjunct to a low
dose of L-DOPA, we propose that an additional reduction of global
parkinsonism ≥ 25% might predict clinical efficacy. As adjunct to an optimal dose
of L-DOPA, we propose that additional anti-parkinsonian benefit ≥ 20%, with
global parkinsonism as the end point, might predict clinical efficacy. For the
treatment of dyskinesia, we suggest that the predictability threshold be set
at ≥ 25% reduction of peak dose dyskinesia, while we believe that this threshold 
should be > 50% reduction of peak dose psychosis-like behaviours for
psychosis-related end points. This article represents the first step in
determining what efficacy might be necessary to achieve in pre-clinical studies
in the MPTP-lesioned marmoset prior to confidently advancing drugs to clinical
trials. We hope that it will help in the drug discovery and development process, 
notably by avoiding exposing patients to drugs that have little probability of
clinical efficacy based upon pre-clinical experiments.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) has attracted much attention as a useful
model for studying social behaviors [1-3]. They naturally live in a monogamous
family group and exhibit cooperative breeding [4], in which parents and older
siblings help to carry infants less than 2 months old [5-7]. Marmoset parents
also transfer foods to their offspring, a process that may help them learn the
food diet [8]. Furthermore, marmosets show spontaneous altruistic behaviors, such
as providing food to non-reciprocating and genetically unrelated individuals [9].
These social habits indicate that marmosets may be a useful non-human primate
model for studying parenting and altruistic behaviors, as well as underlying
neural mechanisms. Using a novel rescue paradigm, we found that marmoset parents 
and older siblings showed strong motivation to rescue trapped young infants but
not juvenile marmosets beyond 2 months of age, and infant calls alone could
trigger these parents' rescue behaviors. The marmoset parents showed little
rescue of each other, but young infants or infant calls could also induce such
parents' mutual rescue. Moreover, all these infant- and mate-rescue behaviors
depended on currently having young infants in the family group. Functional MRI
studies on awake adult marmosets showed that calls from young infants, but not
juvenile marmosets, elicited a large-scale activation of specific brain areas
including auditory and insular cortices, and such activation was absent in
marmosets not living with infants. Thus, such infant-induced modification of
neural activity offers a window for examining the neural basis of altruistic
behaviors in marmoset monkeys.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a New World monkey that is
increasingly used in pharmacological and toxicological studies. Thiopurine
S-methyltransferase (TPMT) plays roles in the metabolism of widely used
anticancer and anti-inflammatory drugs. Here, we report the isolation and
molecular characterization of marmoset TPMT cDNA, which was found to contain an
open-reading frame of 245 amino acids that was approximately 92% identical to its
human ortholog. Marmoset TPMT was phylogenetically closer to other primate
orthologs than to its pig, dog, rabbit, or rodent orthologs. Among the five
marmoset tissue types analyzed, marmoset TPMT mRNA was most abundant in kidney
and liver, just as human TPMT is. These results suggest that marmoset and human
TPMT are similar at the molecular level.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a New World primate, is currently
attracting much attention as a nonhuman primate model for pharmacological and
pharmacokinetic studies in preclinical research. In this study, we newly isolated
the cDNAs of marmoset monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) and MAO-B from liver and brain,
respectively. MAO-A and MAO-B cDNAs, respectively, contained open reading frames 
of 527 and 520 amino acids and were approximately 92% and 95% identical to their 
human orthologs. Marmoset MAOs were phylogenetically closer to primate MAOs,
including human MAOs, than to pig, dog, or rodent MAOs. The genomic and gene
structures of marmoset MAOs were similar to those of humans. Among the five
marmoset tissue types analyzed, the expression levels of MAO-A mRNA were
relatively abundant in lung, liver, kidney, and small intestine, whereas the
expression levels of MAO-B mRNA were relatively abundant in brain, liver, kidney,
and small intestine; these tissue distributions are similar to those of human
MAOs. These results suggest that MAO-A and MAO-B are similar at a molecular level
in marmosets and humans.

Cytosolic sulfotransferases (SULTs), which mediate the conjugation of drugs with 
3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate, have been characterized in humans and
cynomolgus monkeys. However, SULTs remain to be evaluated in common marmosets, a 
species of non-human primate often employed in drug metabolism and
pharmacokinetic studies of endogenous and exogenous compounds. In this study,
marmoset SULT1A1, 1A3, 1B1, 1C2, 1E1, and 2A1 cDNAs were isolated and
characterized, based on genome data. The deduced amino acid sequences of these
marmoset SULT cDNAs had high identities (90-95%) with their human orthologs,
except for marmoset SULT2A1, which was only 81% identical to human SULT2A1. The
amino acid sequences of the orthologs of these six SULTs in marmosets, monkeys,
and humans were closely clustered in a phylogenetic tree. The structures and
genomic organizations of marmoset SULT genes were similar to those of their human
orthologs. Among the five marmoset tissues analyzed, SULT mRNAs showed typical
expression patterns. The most abundant SULT mRNAs were SULT1B1 in liver, small
intestine, and kidney; SULT1E1 in lung; and SULT1A3 in brain. Recombinant
marmoset SULT1A1, 1A3, 1B1, 1C2, 1E1, and 2A1 proteins expressed in bacterial
cytosolic fractions mediated sulfate conjugations with
3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate of the following typical human SULT
substrates: dopamine, 1-naphthol, p-nitrophenol, estradiol, and
dehydroepiandrosterone. Taken together, these wide-ranging results suggest
functional and molecular similarities of SULTs among marmosets, monkeys, and
humans.

Recent progress in regenerative medicine has enabled the utilization of
pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) as the resource of therapeutic cells/tissue.
However, immune suppression is still needed when the donor-recipient combination 
is allogeneic. We have reported previously that mouse PSCs-derived
immunosuppressive cells contribute to prolonged survival of grafts derived from
the same mouse PSCs in allogeneic recipients. For its clinical application, a
preclinical study using non-human primates such as common marmoset must be
performed. In this study, we established the induction protocol of
immunosuppressive cells from common marmoset ES cells. Although similar
immunosuppressive macrophages could not be induced by same protocol as that for
mouse PSCs, we employed an inhibitor for histone methyltransferase, DZNep, and
succeeded to induce them. The DZNep-treated macrophage-like cells expressed
several immunosuppressive molecules and significantly inhibited allogeneic mixed 
lymphocyte reaction. The immunosuppressive cells from non-human primate ESCs will
help to establish an immunoregulating strategy in regenerative medicine using
PSCs.

The incidence of liver disease is increasing significantly worldwide and, as a
result, there is a pressing need to develop new technologies and applications for
end-stage liver diseases. For many of them, orthotopic liver transplantation is
the only viable therapeutic option. Stem cells that are capable of
differentiating into all liver cell types and could closely mimic human liver
disease are extremely valuable for disease modeling, tissue regeneration and
repair, and for drug metabolism studies to develop novel therapeutic treatments. 
Despite the extensive research efforts, positive results from rodent models have 
not translated meaningfully into realistic preclinical models and therapies. The 
common marmoset Callithrix jacchus has emerged as a viable non-human primate
model to study various human diseases because of its distinct features and close 
physiologic, genetic and metabolic similarities to humans. C. jacchus embryonic
stem cells (cjESC) and recently generated cjESC-derived hepatocyte-like cells
(cjESC-HLCs) could fill the gaps in disease modeling, liver regeneration and
metabolic studies. They are extremely useful for cell therapy to regenerate and
repair damaged liver tissues in vivo as they could efficiently engraft into the
liver parenchyma. For in vitro studies, they would be advantageous for drug
design and metabolism in developing novel drugs and cell-based therapies.
Specifically, they express both phase I and II metabolic enzymes that share
similar substrate specificities, inhibition and induction characteristics, and
drug metabolism as their human counterparts. In addition, cjESCs and cjESC-HLCs
are advantageous for investigations on emerging research areas, including
blastocyst complementation to generate entire livers, and bioengineering of
discarded livers to regenerate whole livers for transplantation.

In many mammalian species, the production of new neurons in the hippocampal
dentate gyrus continues throughout life. Previous studies using rodents suggest
that adult-born neurons are involved in memory and cognition tasks and mood
regulation. Interferon-alpha (IFNα), a proinflammatory cytokine used for the
treatment of chronic viral hepatitis and malignancies, frequently causes
depressive symptoms in patients and animals, including non-human primates. We
have previously demonstrated that chronic IFNα treatment decreases hippocampal
neurogenesis in mice. Here, we investigated the effects of four-week human
pegylated IFNα treatment on hippocampal neurogenesis and behavior in common
marmosets. Continuous monitoring of voluntary activity levels using an actigraphy
device suggested that adaptive ability is impaired in IFNα-treated animals.
Analyses of BrdU-labeled cells expressing a marker for immature or mature neurons
revealed a significant reduction in the number of new neurons in the hippocampus 
of IFNα-treated animals. These data indicate that chronic human IFNα treatment
causes behavioral changes and a decrease in hippocampal neurogenesis in common
marmosets.

The muscle-tendon arrangement of the m. flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS)
varies among different primate groups. Recent developmental investigations
revealed that the primordium of FDS emerges in the hand region first and
relocates to the forearm later. The relationship between the diverse
muscle-tendon arrangement and the characteristic developmental process of FDS is 
important for understanding the evolutionary changes of the FDS. Moreover, the
innervation pattern cannot go unremarked when discussing the muscle homology and 
evolution. We examined the muscle-tendon arrangement and intramuscular nerve
distribution of the FDS in three genera of Platyrrhini: three common marmosets
(Callithrix jacchus), two squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus) and two spider
monkeys (Ateles sp.). We observed that the FDS consisted of multiple muscle
bellies. The origin of the muscle bellies to digits II and V varied, whereas
muscle bellies to digits III and IV consistently originated from the medial
epicondyle. The muscle-tendon arrangement of the FDS differed among the three
genera owing to the different origins of muscle bellies to digits II and V. In
all the examined specimens, the muscle bellies to digits II and/or III were
innervated by the direct nerve branches from the median nerve. However, the
muscle bellies to digits IV and V never received direct nerve branches from the
median nerve. Nerve branches within the belly to digit III extended into the
belly to digit IV, and one nerve branch within the belly to digit IV extended
into the belly to digit V. These consistent nerve distribution patterns suggest
that different patterns of FDS muscle-tendon arrangement have changed from that
of a common ancestral condition. It is plausible that the diverse origins of
muscle bellies in the FDS are attributable to the difference in the destination
for the relocation of the muscle bellies during developmental processes.

Mutations in non-coding regulatory DNA such as enhancers underlie a wide variety 
of diseases including developmental disorders and cancer. As enhancers rapidly
evolve, understanding their function and configuration in non-human disease
models can have important clinical applications. Here, we analyze enhancer
configurations in tissues isolated from the common marmoset, a widely used
primate model for human disease. Integrating these data with human and mouse
data, we find that enhancers containing trait-associated variants are
preferentially conserved. In contrast, most human-specific enhancers are highly
variable between individuals, with a subset failing to contact promoters. These
are located further away from genes and more often reside in inactive
B-compartments. Our data show that enhancers typically emerge as instable
elements with minimal biological impact prior to their integration in a
transcriptional program. Furthermore, our data provide insight into which trait
variations in enhancers can be faithfully modeled using the common marmoset.

Marmoset wasting syndrome (MWS) is clinically characterized by progressive weight
loss. Although morbidity and mortality of MWS are relatively high in captive
marmosets, its causes remain unknown. Lipid mediators are bioactive metabolites
which are produced from polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as arachidonic acid
(AA) and eicosapentaenoic acid. These lipid metabolites regulate a wide range of 
inflammatory responses and they are excreted into the urine. As urinary lipid
profiles reflect systemic inflammatory conditions, we comprehensively measured
the levels of 141 types of lipid metabolites in the urines obtained from healthy 
common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) (N = 7) or marmosets with MWS (N = 7). We
found that 41 types of metabolites were detected in all urine samples of both
groups. Among them, AA-derived metabolites accounted for 63% (26/41 types) of all
detected metabolites. Notably, the levels of AA-derived prostaglandin (PG) E2,
PGF2α, thromboxane (TX) B2 and F2-isoprostanes significantly increased in the
urine samples of marmosets with MWS. In this study, we found some urinary lipid
metabolites which may be involved in the development of MWS. Although the cause
of MWS remains unclear, our findings may provide some insight into understanding 
the mechanisms of development of MWS.

The input of environmental time cues and expression of circadian activity rhythms
may change with aging. Among nonphotic zeitgebers, social cues from conspecific
vocalizations may contribute to the stability and survival of individuals of
social species, such as nonhuman primates. We evaluated aging-related changes on 
social synchronization of the circadian activity rhythm (CAR) in a social diurnal
primate, the common marmoset. The activity of 18 male marmosets was recorded by
actiwatches in two conditions. (1) Experimental - 4 young adult (5 ± 2 yrs of
age) and 4 older (10 ± 2 yrs of age) animals maintained under LD 12/12 h and LL
in a room with full insulation for light but only partial insulation for sound
from vocalizations of conspecifics maintained outdoors in the colony; and (2)
Control - 10 young adult animals maintained outdoors in the colony (5 animals as 
a control per age group). In LL, the CAR of young adults showed more stable
synchronization with controls. Among the aged marmosets, two free-ran with
τ > 24 h, whereas the other two showed relative coordination during the first
30 days in LL, but free-ran thereafter. These differences were reflected in the
"social" phase angles (ψon and ψoff ) between rhythms of experimental and control
animal groups. Moreover, the activity patterns of aged animals showed lower
social synchrony with controls compared to young adults, with the time lags of
the time series between each experimental group and control group being negative 
in aged and positive in young adult animals (t-test, p < 0.05). The index of
stability of the CAR showed no differences according to age, while the intradaily
variability of the CAR was higher in the aged animals during
LD-resynchronization, who took additional days to resynchronize. Thus, the social
modulation on CAR may vary with age in marmosets. In the aged group, there was a 
lower effect of social synchronization, which may be associated with
aging-related changes in the synchronization and generation of the CAR as well as
in system outputs.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a New World primate that is becoming 
increasingly popular as a preclinical model. To assess functional connectivity
(FC) across the marmoset brain, resting-state functional MRI (RS-fMRI) is often
performed under isoflurane anesthesia to avoid the effects of motion,
physiological stress, and training requirements. In marmosets, however, it
remains unclear how isoflurane anesthesia affects patterns of FC. Here, we
investigated the effects of isoflurane on FC when delivered with either medical
air or 100% pure oxygen, two canonical methods of inhalant isoflurane anesthesia 
delivery. The results demonstrated that when delivered with either medical air or
100% oxygen, isoflurane globally decreased FC across resting-state networks that 
were identified in awake marmosets. Generally, although isoflurane globally
decreased FC in resting-state networks, the spatial structure of the networks was
preserved. Outside of the context of RS networks, we indexed pair-wise functional
connectivity between regions across the brain and found that isoflurane
substantially altered interhemispheric and thalamic FC. Taken together, these
findings indicate that RS-fMRI under isoflurane anesthesia is useful to evaluate 
the global structure of functional networks, but may obfuscate important nodes of
some network components when compared to data acquired in fully awake marmosets.

The neocortex has expanded during mammalian evolution. Overexpression studies in 
developing mouse and ferret neocortex have implicated the human-specific gene
ARHGAP11B in neocortical expansion, but the relevance for primate evolution has
been unclear. Here, we provide functional evidence that ARHGAP11B causes
expansion of the primate neocortex. ARHGAP11B expressed in fetal neocortex of the
common marmoset under control of the gene's own (human) promoter increased the
numbers of basal radial glia progenitors in the marmoset outer subventricular
zone, increased the numbers of upper-layer neurons, enlarged the neocortex, and
induced its folding. Thus, the human-specific ARHGAP11B drives changes in
development in the nonhuman primate marmoset that reflect the changes in
evolution that characterize human neocortical development.

Olfactory cues play an important role in mammalian biology, but have been
challenging to assess in the field. Current methods pose problematic issues with 
sample storage and transportation, limiting our ability to connect chemical
variation in scents with relevant ecological and behavioral contexts. Real-time, 
in-field analysis via portable gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) has
the potential to overcome these issues, but with trade-offs of reduced
sensitivity and compound mass range. We field-tested the ability of portable
GC-MS to support two representative applications of chemical ecology research
with a wild arboreal primate, common marmoset monkeys (Callithrix jacchus). We
developed methods to (a) evaluate the chemical composition of marmoset scent
marks deposited at feeding sites and (b) characterize the scent profiles of
exudates eaten by marmosets. We successfully collected marmoset scent marks
across several canopy heights, with the portable GC-MS detecting known components
of marmoset glandular secretions and differentiating these from in-field
controls. Likewise, variation in the chemical profile of scent marks demonstrated
a significant correlation with marmoset feeding behavior, indicating these
scents' biological relevance. The portable GC-MS also delineated species-specific
olfactory signatures of exudates fed on by marmosets. Despite the trade-offs,
portable GC-MS represents a viable option for characterizing olfactory compounds 
used by wild mammals, yielding biologically relevant data. While the decision to 
adopt portable GC-MS will likely depend on site- and project-specific needs, our 
ability to conduct two example applications under relatively challenging field
conditions bodes well for the versatility of in-field GC-MS.

Early environment can have a major impact on development, with family life known 
to play an important role. Longitudinal studies can therefore help increase our
understanding of variance in cognitive abilities in young animals, as well as
over time. We followed 22 marmosets (11 male and 11 female) from infancy through 
to early adolescence. At 3 months old, the marmosets were trained to reliably
touch a rewarded stimulus. At 5 months, behavior was observed within the natal
group. At 9 months, the marmosets were given a visual discrimination task to
assess learning ability. Mann-Whitney U tests found no sex or family size
differences in number of errors at 3 or 9 months. While no significant
relationships were found between behavior in the family and learning at 3 months,
significant negative correlations were found between duration spent in locomotion
and learning errors (p = .05), as well as between frequency of calm vocalizations
and learning errors (p = .001) at 9 months. A U-shape curve was found between
amount of social play and learning at 9 months. Positive family interactions,
including moderate amounts of play, as well as calm individual behavior, may
therefore be important in learning. This study sheds light on cognitive
development in much younger marmosets than previously studied, and helps increase
understanding of how individual differences in learning may arise.

Testicular peritubular cells (TPCs) are smooth muscle-like cells, which form a
compartment surrounding the seminiferous tubules. Previous studies employing
isolated human testicular peritubular cells (HTPCs) indicated that their roles in
the testis go beyond sperm transport and include paracrine and immunological
contributions. Peritubular cells from a non-human primate (MKTPCs), the common
marmoset monkey, Callithrix jacchus, share a high degree of homology with HTPCs. 
However, like their human counterparts these cells age in vitro and replicative
senescence limits in-depth functional or mechanistic studies. Therefore, a stable
cellular model was established. MKTPCs of a young adult animal were immortalized 
by piggyBac transposition of human telomerase (hTERT), that is, without the
expression of viral oncogenes. Immortalized MKTPCs (iMKTPCs) grew without
discernable changes for more than 50 passages. An initial characterization
revealed typical genes expressed by peritubular cells (androgen receptor (AR),
smooth-muscle actin (ACTA2), calponin (CNN1)). A proteome analysis of the primary
MKTPCs and the derived immortalized cell line confirmed that the cells almost
completely retained their phenotype. To test whether they respond in a similar
way as HTPCs, iMKTPCs were challenged with forskolin (FSK) and ATP. As HTPCs,
they showed increased expression level of the StAR protein (StAR) after FSK
stimulation, indicating steroidogenic capacity. ATP increased the expression of
pro-inflammatory factors (e.g. IL1B; CCL7), as it is the case in HTPCs. Finally, 
we confirmed that iMKTPCs can efficiently be transfected. Therefore, they
represent a highly relevant translational model, which allows mechanistic studies
for further exploration of the roles of testicular peritubular cells.

Many primates show responses to dead infants, yet testing explanations for these 
behaviors has been difficult. Callitrichids present a unique opportunity to
delineate between hypotheses, since unlike most species, male caretakers form
closer social bonds with infants than mothers. Callitrichids are also known to
commit infanticide, leaving obvious wounds that may enable them to more readily
recognize death. We present: (1) a case study of a wild common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus) group responding to an infant's natural death, and (2) a
review of published infant deaths across callitrichids (N = 16), testing for
trends in the sex of reacting individuals and cause of death. In our case study, 
several group members frequently interacted with the dead infant, attempting to
carry it. However, the strongest response was from a male that remained with the 
corpse for ~ 3 h, despite his group leaving the area. Across callitrichid
species, corpse interactions were significantly sex-biased: 100% (N = 6) of
accidental deaths involved corpse interaction by males (p = 0.007), compared to
60% (N = 3 of 5) by females (p = 0.095). Cause of death also played a significant
role, with individuals attempting to carry dead infants in 100% (N = 6) of
accidental deaths, but only 11.1% (N = 1 of 9) of infanticides (p = 0.001).
Although the available literature is small and potentially subject to publication
biases, these data support the idea that visually obvious wounds may influence
callitrichids' perception of dead conspecifics. Additionally, male-biased
patterns of corpse interaction in callitrichids indicate that social bonds likely
shape reactions to the dead, in addition to kinship. While published data on
primate thanatology are limited, this study demonstrates quantitative approaches 
that can provide empirical insights into primates' responses to dead
conspecifics.

Whole brain neuroanatomy using tera-voxel light-microscopic data sets is of much 
current interest. A fundamental problem in this field is the mapping of
individual brain data sets to a reference space. Previous work has not rigorously
quantified in-vivo to ex-vivo distortions in brain geometry from tissue
processing. Further, existing approaches focus on registering unimodal volumetric
data; however, given the increasing interest in the marmoset model for
neuroscience research and the importance of addressing individual brain
architecture variations, new algorithms are necessary to cross-register
multimodal data sets including MRIs and multiple histological series. Here we
present a computational approach for same-subject multimodal MRI-guided
reconstruction of a series of consecutive histological sections, jointly with
diffeomorphic mapping to a reference atlas. We quantify the scale change during
different stages of brain histological processing using the Jacobian determinant 
of the diffeomorphic transformations involved. By mapping the final image stacks 
to the ex-vivo post-fixation MRI, we show that (a) tape-transfer assisted
histological sections can be reassembled accurately into 3D volumes with a local 
scale change of 2.0 ± 0.4% per axis dimension; in contrast, (b) tissue
perfusion/fixation as assessed by mapping the in-vivo MRIs to the ex-vivo post
fixation MRIs shows a larger median absolute scale change of 6.9 ± 2.1% per axis 
dimension. This is the first systematic quantification of local metric
distortions associated with whole-brain histological processing, and we expect
that the results will generalize to other species. These local scale changes will
be important for computing local properties to create reference brain maps.

Common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) cannot recognize global configurations of
sound patterns but can recognize adjacent relations of sounds.

Processing the temporal configuration of discrete sounds to extract a regular
pattern is fundamental to humans' faculties of perceiving words and musical
phrases. To investigate such auditory pattern perception in monkeys, I trained
two common marmosets to discriminate between AB-AB and AA-BB patterns under two
training paradigms. One was an absolute discrimination task, in which the
discrimination between these stimuli without reference cues was required. The
other was a relative discrimination task, in which the detection of a change from
one stimulus to the other was required. The marmosets failed in the absolute
discrimination task but achieved the relative discrimination task. Failure in the
absolute task indicated that the marmosets were unable to form a representation
of the global sound patterns in their long-term memory stores. In contrast,
success in the relative task indicated that the marmosets had short-term memory
of ongoing sounds that enabled an online monitoring to detect deviations between 
incoming sounds and the anticipated upcoming sounds. Thus, the current findings
imply that marmosets can at least perceive adjacent tone relations in an auditory
stream regardless of the temporal configuration of the global sound patterns.

High trait anxiety is associated with altered activity across emotion regulation 
circuitry and a higher risk of developing anxiety disorders and depression. This 
circuitry is extensively modulated by serotonin. Here, to understand why some
people may be more vulnerable to developing affective disorders, we investigated 
whether serotonin-related gene expression across the brain's emotion regulation
circuitry may underlie individual differences in trait anxiety using the common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus, mixed sexes) as a model. First, we assessed the
association of region-specific expression of the serotonin transporter (SLC6A4)
and serotonin receptor (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2C) genes with anxiety-like behavior;
and second, we investigated their causal role in two key features of the high
trait anxious phenotype: high responsivity to anxiety-provoking stimuli and an
exaggerated conditioned threat response. While the expression of the serotonin
receptors did not show a significant relationship with anxiety-like behavior in
any of the targeted brain regions, serotonin transporter expression, specifically
within the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) and most strongly in the
right amygdala, was associated positively with anxiety-like behavior. The causal 
relationship between amygdala serotonin levels and an animal's sensitivity to
threat was confirmed via direct amygdala infusions of a selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), citalopram. Both anxiety-like behaviors, and
conditioned threat-induced responses were reduced by the blockade of serotonin
reuptake in the amygdala. Together, these findings provide evidence that high
amygdala serotonin transporter expression contributes to the high trait anxious
phenotype and suggest that reduction of threat reactivity by SSRIs may be
mediated by their actions in the amygdala.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Findings here
contribute to our understanding of how the serotonin system underlies an
individual's expression of threat-elicited negative emotions such as anxiety and 
fear within nonhuman primates. Exploration of serotonergic gene expression across
brain regions implicated in emotion regulation revealed that serotonin
transporter gene expression in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) and
most strongly in the amygdala, but none of the serotonin receptor genes, were
predictive of interindividual differences in anxiety-like behavior. Targeting of 
amygdala serotonin reuptake with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) 
confirmed the causal relationship between amygdala serotonin transporter and an
animal's sensitivity to threat by reversing expression of two key features of the
high trait-like anxiety phenotype: high responsivity to anxiety-provoking
uncertain threat and responsivity to certain conditioned threat.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a New World monkey, is emerging as a
promising animal model for biomedical and neuroscience research. This species
shares its basic brain architecture, including the organization of the motor
cortical areas and the connections between these and other areas, with humans and
other primates. Its small and lissencephalic cerebral cortex is suitable for the 
application of modern biological techniques. Optogenetic stimulation of the motor
cortex induces forelimb movements, and two-photon calcium imaging allows
detection of forelimb movement-related activity in multiple motor cortical
neurons. The common marmoset also has a large repertoire of forelimb-related
behaviors and vocal communications. Thus, the common marmoset is a good model for
research into voluntary forelimb movements, social behaviors, and their
dysfunctions.

We describe our connectomics pipeline for processing anterograde tracer injection
data for the brain of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). Brain sections
were imaged using a batch slide scanner (NanoZoomer 2.0-HT) and we used
artificial intelligence to precisely segment the tracer signal from the
background in the fluorescence images. The shape of each brain was reconstructed 
by reference to a block-face and all data were mapped into a common 3D brain
space with atlas and 2D cortical flat map. To overcome the effect of using a
single template atlas to specify cortical boundaries, brains were cyto- and
myelo-architectonically annotated to create individual 3D atlases. Registration
between the individual and common brain cortical boundaries in the flat map space
was done to absorb the variation of each brain and precisely map all tracer
injection data into one cortical brain space. We describe the methodology of our 
pipeline and analyze the accuracy of our tracer segmentation and brain
registration approaches. Results show our pipeline can successfully process and
normalize tracer injection experiments into a common space, making it suitable
for large-scale connectomics studies with a focus on the cerebral cortex.

Cochlear development is a complex process with precise spatiotemporal patterns. A
detailed understanding of this process is important for studies of congenital
hearing loss and regenerative medicine. However, much of our understanding of
cochlear development is based on rodent models. Animal models that bridge the gap
between humans and rodents are needed. In this study, we investigated the
development of hearing organs in a small New World monkey species, the common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). We describe the general stages of cochlear
development in comparison with those of humans and mice. Moreover, we examined
more than 25 proteins involved in cochlear development and found that expression 
patterns were generally conserved between rodents and primates. However, several 
proteins involved in supporting cell processes and neuronal development exhibited
interspecific expression differences. Human fetal samples for studies of
primate-specific cochlear development are extremely rare, especially for late
developmental stages. Our results support the use of the common marmoset as an
effective alternative for analyses of primate cochlear development.

Vocal communication in animals often involves taking turns vocalizing. In humans,
turn-taking is a fundamental rule in conversation. Among non-human primates, the 
common marmoset is known to engage in antiphonal calling using phee calls and
trill calls. Calls of the trill type are the most common, yet difficult to study,
because they are not very loud and uttered in conditions when animals are in
close proximity to one another. Here we recorded trill calls in captive
pair-housed marmosets using wearable microphones, while the animals were together
with their partner or separated, but within trill call range. Trills were
exchanged mainly with the partner and not with other animals in the room. Animals
placed outside the home cage increased their trill call rate and uttered more
trills in response to their partner compared to strangers. The fundamental
frequency, F0, of trills increased when animals were placed outside the cage. Our
results indicate that trill calls can be monitored using wearable audio equipment
and that minor changes in social context affect trill call interactions and
spectral properties of trill calls.

Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) is endogenously produced in the skin of primates
when exposed to the appropriate wavelengths of ultraviolet light (UV-B). Common
marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) maintained indoors require dietary provision of
vitamin D3 due to lack of sunlight exposure. The minimum dietary vitamin D3
requirement and the maximum amount of vitamin D3 that can be metabolized by
marmosets is unknown. Observations of metabolic bone disease and gastrointestinal
malabsorption have led to wide variation in dietary vitamin D3 provision amongst 
research institutions, with resulting variation in circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin 
D3 (25(OH)D3 ), the accepted marker for vitamin D sufficiency/deficiency.
Multiple studies have reported serum 25(OH)D3 in captive marmosets, but 25(OH)D3 
is not the final product of vitamin D3 metabolism. In addition to serum 25(OH)D3,
we measured the most physiologically active metabolite, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 
(1,25(OH)2 D3 ), and the less well understood metabolite, 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin 
D3 (24,25(OH)2 D3 ) to characterize the marmoset's ability to metabolize dietary 
vitamin D3 . We present vitamin D3 metabolite and related serum chemistry value
colony reference ranges in marmosets provided diets with 26,367 (Colony A,
N = 113) or 8,888 (Colony B, N = 52) international units (IU) of dietary vitamin 
D3 per kilogram of dry matter. Colony A marmosets had higher serum 25(OH)D3
(426 ng/ml [SD 200] vs. 215 ng/ml [SD 113]) and 24,25(OH)2 D3 (53 ng/ml [SD 35]
vs. 7 ng/ml [SD 5]). There was no difference in serum 1,25(OH)2 D3 between the
colonies. Serum 1,25(OH)2 D3 increased and 25(OH)D3 decreased with age, but the
effect was weak. Marmosets tightly regulate metabolism of dietary vitamin D3 into
the active metabolite 1,25(OH)2 D3 ; excess 25(OH)D3 is metabolized into
24,25(OH)2 D3 . This ability explains the tolerance of high levels of dietary
vitamin D3 by marmosets, however, our data suggest that these high dietary levels
are not required.

The primate brain contains a large number of interconnected visual areas, whose
spatial organization and intracortical projections show a high level of
conservation across species. One fiber pathway of recent interest is the vertical
occipital fasciculus (VOF), which is thought to support communication between
dorsal and ventral visual areas in the occipital lobe. A recent comparative
diffusion MRI (dMRI) study reported that the VOF in the macaque brain bears a
similar topology to that of the human, running superficial and roughly
perpendicular to the optic radiation. The present study reports a comparative
investigation of the VOF in the common marmoset, a small New World monkey whose
lissencephalic brain is approximately tenfold smaller than the macaque and
150-fold smaller than the human. High-resolution ex vivo dMRI of two marmoset
brains revealed an occipital white matter structure that closely resembles that
of the larger primate species, with one notable difference. Namely, unlike in the
macaque and the human, the VOF in the marmoset is spatially fused with other,
more anterior vertical tracts, extending anteriorly between the parietal and
temporal cortices. We compare several aspects of this continuous structure, which
we term the VOF complex (VOF +), and neighboring fasciculi to those of macaques
and humans. We hypothesize that the essential topology of the VOF+ is a conserved
feature of the posterior cortex in anthropoid primates, with a clearer
fragmentation into multiple named fasciculi in larger, more gyrified brains.

The social, health, and economic challenges of a steadily increasing aging
population demand the use of appropriate translational animal models to address
questions like healthy aging, vaccination strategies, or potential interventions 
during the aging process. Due to their genetic proximity to humans, especially
nonhuman primates (NHPs) with a relatively short generation period compared to
humans, qualify as excellent animal models for these purposes. The use of common 
marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) in gerontology research steadily increased over
the last decades, yet important information about their aging parameters are
still missing. We therefore aimed to characterize their aging immune system by
comprehensive flow cytometric phenotyping of blood immune cells from juvenile,
adult, aging, and geriatric animals. Aged and geriatric animals displayed clear
signs of immunosenescence. A decline in CD4/CD8 ratio, increased expression of
HLA-DR and PD-1, higher frequencies of CD95+ memory cells, alterations in
cytokine secretion, and a decline in the proliferative capacity proved T cell
senescence in aging marmosets. Also, the B cell compartment was affected by
age-related changes: while overall B cell numbers remained stable with advancing 
age, expression of the activation marker CD80 increased and immunoglobulin M
expression decreased. Interestingly, marmoset B cell memory subset distribution
rather mirrored the human situation than that of other NHP. CD21+ CD27- naïve B
cell frequencies decreased while those of CD21- CD27- tissue memory B cells
increased with age. Furthermore, frequencies and numbers of NK cells as part of
the innate immune system declined with advancing age. Thus, the observed
immunological changes in common marmosets over their life span revealed several
similarities to age-related changes in humans and encourages further studies to
strengthen the common marmoset as a potential aging model.

BACKGROUND: The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is one of the most studied
primate model organisms. However, the marmoset genomes available in the public
databases are highly fragmented and filled with sequence gaps, hindering research
advances related to marmoset genomics and transcriptomics.
RESULTS: Here we utilize single-molecule, long-read sequence data to improve and 
update the existing genome assembly and report a near-complete genome of the
common marmoset. The assembly is of 2.79 Gb size, with a contig N50 length of
6.37 Mb and a chromosomal scaffold N50 length of 143.91 Mb, representing the most
contiguous and high-quality marmoset genome up to date. Approximately 90% of the 
assembled genome was represented in contigs longer than 1 Mb, with approximately 
104-fold improvement in contiguity over the previously published marmoset genome.
More than 98% of the gaps from the previously published genomes were filled
successfully, which improved the mapping rates of genomic and transcriptomic data
on to the assembled genome.
CONCLUSIONS: Altogether the updated, high-quality common marmoset genome assembly
provide improvements at various levels over the previous versions of the marmoset
genome assemblies. This will allow researchers working on primate genomics to
apply the genome more efficiently for their genomic and transcriptomic sequence
data.

Due to the global burden of dengue disease, a vaccine is urgently needed. One of 
the key points in vaccine development is the development of a robust and reliable
animal model of dengue virus infection. Characteristics including the ability to 
sustain viral replication, demonstration of clinical signs, and immune response
that resemble those of human dengue virus infection are vital in animal models.
Preclinical studies in vaccine development usually include parameters such as
safety evaluation, induction of viremia and antigenemia, immunogenicity, and
vaccine effectiveness. Although mice have been used as a model, non-human
primates have an advantage over mice because of their relative similarity to
humans in their genetic composition and immune responses. This review compares
the viremia kinetics and antibody responses of cynomolgus macaques (Macaca
fasicularis), common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus), and tamarins (Saguinus midas
and Saguinus labitus) and summarize the perspectives and the usefulness along
with challenges in dengue vaccine development.

Avoidant Coping Style to High Imminence Threat Is Linked to Higher Anxiety-Like
Behavior.

Human studies with self-reported measures have suggested a link between an
avoidant coping style and high anxiety. Here, using the common marmoset as a
model, we characterize the latent factors underlying behavioral responses of
these monkeys towards low and high imminence threat and investigate if a
predominantly avoidant behavioral response to high imminence threat is associated
with greater anxiety-like behavior in a context of low imminence threat.
Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) of the human intruder test of low imminence
threat revealed a single factor in which a combination of active vigilance and
avoidance responses underpinned anxiety-like behavior. In contrast, two
negatively-associated factors were revealed in the model snake test reflecting
active and avoidant coping to high imminence threat. Subsequent analysis showed
that animals with a predominantly avoidant coping style on the model snake test
displayed higher anxiety-like behavior on the human intruder test, findings
consistent with those described in humans. Together they illustrate the richness 
of the behavioral repertoire displayed by marmosets in low and high imminence
threatening contexts and the additional insight that factor analysis can provide 
by identifying the latent factors underlying these complex behavioral datasets.
They also highlight the translational value of this approach when studying the
neural circuits underlying complex anxiety-like states in this primate model.

While pregnancy-related proteins (PRP) are known to contribute to immunotolerance
during pregnancy, their significance to development of invasive placenta is
unclear. We compared PRP expression in humans and the common marmoset (Callithrix
jacchus), a new-world monkey. Invasive placenta was observed at the
maternal-foetal interface of marmoset placenta from green fluorescent protein
(GFP)-expressing foetus and wild type mother. The pregnancy zone protein (PZP)
and alpha-2 macroglobulin-like 1 (A2ML1) proteins exhibited the most prominent
increase in expression during the second trimester in humans and marmoset,
respectively. In humans, PZP accumulated at the maternal-foetal interface and
A2ML1 accumulated in the amnion. Similarly, A2ML1 mRNA was detected in marmoset
placenta. These proteins belong to the A2M family of protease inhibitors, and
both PZP and A2ML1 share around 90% homology between human and marmoset and have 
highly conserved structures. However, the protease-reacting bait regions of the
proteins had lower homology (56.8-60.7% in proteins) relative to the rest of the 
sequence. Notably, the cleavage site of a proinflammatory proline-endopeptidase
was preserved in human PZP and marmoset A2ML1. These proteins contain multiple
sites that are cleaved by proteases involving proline-endopeptidase. Systemic
regulation of these A2M family proteins may be important in animals with invasive
placenta.

Mammalian pluripotent stem cells are thought to exist in two states: naive and
primed. Generally, unlike those in rodents, pluripotent stem cells in primates,
including humans, are regarded as being in the primed pluripotent state.
Recently, several groups reported the existence of naive pluripotent stem cells
in humans. In this study, we report the conversion of primed state embryonic stem
cells from common marmoset, a New World monkey, to the naive state using
transgenes. The cells showed typical naive state features, including dome-like
colony morphology, growth factor requirement, gene expression profile, X
chromosome activation state, and energy metabolic status. Moreover, interspecies 
chimeric embryo formation ability with mouse embryos was increased in the naive
state. This technique can be applied in basic medical research using nonhuman
primates, such as preclinical use of naive pluripotent stem cells and generating 
genetically modified primates.

BLIMP1 (PRDM1) and VASA (DDX4) play pivotal roles in the development of the germ 
cell linage. Importantly, these genes are specifically expressed in germ cells;
BLIMP1 in primordial germ cells (PGCs) to early-stage gonocytes, and VASA in
migration-stage PGCs to mature gametes. The high reproductive efficiency of
common marmosets (marmosets; Callithrix jacchus) makes them advantageous for use 
in germ cell research. We herein report the generation of a male marmoset
embryonic stem cell (ESC) line harboring BLIMP1 and DDX4 double reporters. This
ESC line will be a useful tool for investigating male gametogenesis in non-human 
primates.

Generally behavioral neuroscience studies of the common marmoset employ
adaptations of well-established training methods used with macaque monkeys.
However, in many cases these approaches do not readily generalize to marmosets
indicating a need for alternatives. Here we present the development of one such
alternate: a platform for semiautomated, voluntary in-home cage behavioral
training that allows for the study of naturalistic behaviors. We describe the
design and production of a modular behavioral training apparatus using CAD
software and digital fabrication. We demonstrate that this apparatus permits
voluntary behavioral training and data collection throughout the marmoset's
waking hours with little experimenter intervention. Furthermore, we demonstrate
the use of this apparatus to reconstruct the kinematics of the marmoset's upper
limb movement during natural foraging behavior.NEW & NOTEWORTHY The study of
marmosets in neuroscience has grown rapidly and presents unique challenges. We
address those challenges with an innovative platform for semiautomated, voluntary
training that allows marmosets to train throughout their waking hours with
minimal experimenter intervention. We describe the use of this platform to
capture upper limb kinematics during foraging and to expand the opportunities for
behavioral training beyond the limits of traditional training sessions. This
flexible platform can easily incorporate other tasks.

Treatment of epilepsy remains difficult because patients suffer from
pharmacoresistant forms of the disease and drug side-effects. Thus, there is an
urgent need to identify not only new antiepileptic drug candidates but also novel
epileptic animal models. Here, we characterize seizures induced with kainic acid 
(KA) in the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). Adult marmosets received 0.1,
1, or 10 mg/kg of KA subcutaneously. All animals exhibited early convulsive
behavior (seizure scores of I and II on the Racine scale). Seizure scores were
low at lower KA doses, but the highest dose of KA tested triggered generalized
seizures (scores IV and V on the Racine scale). We next performed preliminary
evaluation of the efficacy of the antiepileptic drug diazepam. This drug at
1 mg/kg (delivered subcutaneously) prevented 10 mg/kg KA-induced stage V
seizures. KA administration to marmosets reliably triggers generalized seizures; 
therefore, the marmoset is a useful animal model in which to analyze the seizures
of a nonhuman primate brain and to develop new treatments for epilepsy.

This study aimed to investigate the effect of estrogen withdrawal on bone tissue 
in adult female marmoset monkeys. In a 1-year follow-up study we used
quantitative computer tomography to measure total bone mineral density (BMD) of
the proximal tibia and the second-last lumbar vertebral body (L5/L6) before and
1, 3, 6, and 12 months after ovariectomy. Body mass did not significantly change 
during the 1-year observation period. However, a significant decline of total BMD
after ovariectomy was observed in the proximal tibia but not in L5/L6. In
addition, regression analysis showed a significant positive relationship between 
BMD and body mass in both tibia and L5/L6. The results of our study support the
idea that ovariectomized marmoset monkeys may serve as a model to investigate
bone loss related to decline of estrogen production.

Aging Western societies are facing an increasing prevalence of chronic
autoimmune-mediated inflammatory disorders (AIMIDs) for which treatments that are
safe and effective are scarce. One of the main reasons for this situation is the 
lack of animal models, which accurately replicate clinical and pathological
aspects of the human diseases. One important AIMID is the neuroinflammatory
disease multiple sclerosis (MS), for which the mouse experimental autoimmune
encephalomyelitis (EAE) model has been frequently used in preclinical research.
Despite some successes, there is a long list of experimental treatments that have
failed to reproduce promising effects observed in murine EAE models when they
were tested in the clinic. This frustrating situation indicates a wide validity
gap between mouse EAE and MS. This monography describes the development of an EAE
model in nonhuman primates, which may help to bridge the gap.

Even after birth, neuronal production continues in the ventricular-subventricular
zone (V-SVZ) and hippocampus in many mammals. The immature new neurons
("neuroblasts") migrate and then mature at their final destination. In humans,
neuroblast production and migration toward the neocortex and the olfactory bulb
(OB) occur actively only for a few months after birth and then sharply decline
with age. However, the precise spatiotemporal profiles and fates of postnatally
born neurons remain unclear due to methodological limitations. We previously
found that common marmosets, small nonhuman primates, share many features of
V-SVZ organization with humans. Here, using marmosets injected with thymidine
analogue(s) during various postnatal periods, we demonstrated spatiotemporal
changes in neurogenesis during development. V-SVZ progenitor proliferation and
neuroblast migration toward the OB and neocortex sharply decreased by 4 months,
most strikingly in a V-SVZ subregion from which neuroblasts migrated toward the
neocortex. Postnatally born neurons matured within a few months in the OB and
hippocampus but remained immature until 6 months in the neocortex. While
neurogenic activity was sustained for a month after birth, the distribution
and/or differentiation diversity was more restricted in 1-month-born cells than
in the neonatal-born population. These findings shed light on distinctive
features of postnatal neurogenesis in primates.

studying critical liver functions such as drug metabolism and toxicity. However, 
as they are isolated from discarded livers that are unsuitable for
transplantation, they possess limited expansion ability in vitro and their
enzymatic functions deteriorate rapidly because they are often of poor quality.
Therefore, there is a compelling reason to find reliable alternative sources of
hepatocytes.
Methods: In this study, we report on efficient and robust differentiation of
embryonic stem cells (ESC) from the common marmoset Callithrix jacchus into
functional hepatocyte-like cells (HLC) using a simple, and reproducible
three-step procedure. ESC-derived HLCs were examined by morphological analysis
and tested for their expression of hepatocyte-specific markers using a
combination of immunohistochemistry, RT-PCR, and biochemical assays. Primary
human hepatocytes were used as controls.
Results: ESC-derived HLCs expressed each of the hepatocyte-specific markers
tested, including albumin; α-fetoprotein; asialoglycoprotein receptor 1; α-1
antitrypsin; hepatocyte nuclear factors 1α and 4; cytokeratin 18; hepatocyte
growth factor receptor; transferrin; tyrosine aminotransferase; alkaline
phosphatase; c-reactive protein; cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP1A2, CYP2E1 and
CYP3A4; and coagulation factors FVII and FIX. They were functionally competent as
demonstrated by biochemical assays in addition to producing urea.
Conclusion: Our data strongly suggest that marmoset HLCs possess characteristics 
similar to those of PHHs. They could, therefore, be invaluable for studies on
drug metabolism and cell transplantation therapy for a variety of liver
disorders. Because of the similarities in the anatomical and physiological
features of the common marmoset to that of humans, Callithrix jacchus is an
appropriate animal model to study human disease conditions and cellular
functions.

Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) G2019S is a relatively common mutation,
associated with 1-3% of Parkinson's disease (PD) cases worldwide. G2019S is
hypothesized to increase LRRK2 kinase activity. Dopaminergic neurons derived from
induced pluripotent stem cells of PD patients carrying LRRK2 G2019S are reported 
to have several phenotypes compared to wild type controls, including increased
activated caspase-3 and reactive oxygen species (ROS), autophagy dysfunction, and
simplification of neurites. The common marmoset is envisioned as a candidate
nonhuman primate species for comprehensive modeling of genetic mutations. Here,
we report our successful use of CRISPR/Cas9 with repair template-mediated
homology directed repair to introduce the LRRK2 G2019S mutation, as well as a
truncation of the LRRK2 kinase domain, into marmoset embryonic and induced
pluripotent stem cells. We found that, similar to humans, marmoset LRRK2 G2019S
resulted in elevated kinase activity. Phenotypic evaluation after dopaminergic
differentiation demonstrated LRRK2 G2019S-mediated increased intracellular ROS,
decreased neuronal viability, and reduced neurite complexity. Importantly, these 
phenotypes were not observed in clones with LRRK2 truncation. These results
demonstrate the feasibility of inducing monogenic mutations in common marmosets
and support the use of this species for generating a novel genetic-based model of
PD that expresses physiological levels of LRRK2 G2019S.

To effectively use a common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) as an experimental
animal species, it is critical to establish a normal characteristics and
morphology of the organs of the common marmoset. Although gross morphology of the
common marmoset heart is reportedly the same as that of humans, little
information is available regarding detailed morphology of the right atrium and
the interatrial septum. Heart specimens were collected from three male and 10
female marmosets aged 9 to 65 months to determine the morphological features of
the right atrium and the interatrial septum. Ten specimens were evaluated
morphologically with a stereoscopic microscope in accordance with preparation and
investigation methods designed to facilitate evaluation. Three specimens were
histologically evaluated after being stained with hematoxylin-eosin, Elastica van
Gieson and periodic acid Schiff. An annular ridge that is not present in the
human heart was present in the right atrium and the interatrial septum of the
common marmoset hearts. Tissue structure of the annular ridge was similar to
atrial myocardial fibers. Furthermore, location of the coronary sinus ostium was 
different to that in humans. Present findings were used to create a schematic
view of the annular ridge in the common marmoset heart. In the common marmoset
heart, the annular ridge may function as a valve of the superior vena cava
ostium, inferior vena cava ostium, and coronary sinus ostium. Present study
provides morphological evidence that common marmosets have a valve-like structure
in the right atrium.

Gaze shifts, the directing of the eyes to an approaching predator, preferred food
source, or potential mate, have universal biological significance for the
survival of a species. Our knowledge of gaze behavior is based primarily on
visually triggered responses, whereas head orientation triggered by auditory
stimuli remains poorly characterized. Common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a
diurnal, small-bodied (∼350 g), New World monkey species, known for its rich
behavioral repertoires during social interactions. We used a lightweight head
tracking system to measure marmosets' reflexive head orientations toward a
natural stimulus presented from behind. We found that marmoset could rotate its
head at angular velocities above 1,000°/s and maintained target accuracy for a
wide range of rotation amplitudes (up to 250°). This unusual, saccadic head
orienting behavior offers opportunities for understanding the many biological
factors that have shaped the evolution of sensorimotor controls of gaze
orientation by the primate brain.

The common marmoset is an important primate species used in drug metabolism
studies. However, glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), essential drug-metabolizing 
enzymes involved in the conjugation of various endogenous and exogenous
substrates, have not been identified or characterized in this species. In this
study, 20 GSTs [including 3 microsomal GSTs (MGSTs)] were identified and
characterized in marmosets. Marmoset GSTs had amino acid sequences highly
identical (86-99%) to human GSTs, except for GSTA4L, which had lower identities
(59-62%) with human GSTAs. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that marmoset GSTs were
closely clustered with their human counterparts. Marmoset GSTs had gene and
genomic structures generally similar to their human counterparts, with some
differences in GSTA, GSTM, and GSTT clusters. Marmoset GST mRNAs exhibited
distinct tissue expression patterns: GSTA1, GSTA3, GSTA4L, GSTK1, GSTT1, GSTZ1,
and MGST1 mRNAs were expressed most abundantly in liver. Other GST mRNAs were
expressed most abundantly in small intestine, lung, brain, or kidney. Expression 
of GSTT4 and GSTT4L mRNAs was detected only in testis. Among all 20 marmoset GST 
mRNAs, the most abundant mRNAs were GSTA1 mRNA in liver, small intestine, and
kidney; GSTM3 mRNA in testis; and MSGT3 mRNA in brain and lung. All 20 GSTs
mediated the conjugation of GST substrates 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene;
1,2-epoxy-3-(p-nitrophenoxy)propane; styrene 7,8-oxide; and/or 1-iodohexane, but 
with different activity levels. Kinetic analyses showed that marmoset GSTM2/GSTM5
and GSTM5/GSTT1 effectively conjugated styrene 7,8-oxide and 1-iodohexane,
respectively, with the highest affinity. These results suggest that the 20 newly 
identified marmoset GSTs were functional drug-metabolizing enzymes able to
conjugate typical GST substrates.

Accumulating evidence suggests that dysregulation of placental DNA methylation
(DNAm) is a mechanism linking maternal weight during pregnancy to metabolic
programming outcomes. The common marmoset, Callithrix jaccus, is a platyrrhine
primate species that has provided much insight into studies of the primate
placenta, maternal condition, and metabolic programming, yet the relationships
between maternal weight and placental DNAm are unknown. Here, we report
genome-wide DNAm from term marmoset placentas using reduced representation
bisulfite sequencing. We identified 74 genes whose DNAm pattern is associated
with maternal weight during gestation. These genes are predominantly involved in 
energy metabolism and homeostasis, including the regulation of glycolytic and
lipid metabolic processes pathways.

INTRODUCTION: The morphological study of wild animals serves as a base for more
advanced studies in clinical medicine, surgery, and pathology. Due to an urgent
need and demand for professionals specialized in this area, studies of this
nature have become indispensable and so the objective of the present study was to
describe the heart morphology of Callithrix jacchus.
METHODS: Ten anatomic pieces of common marmoset were used. The hearts were
removed and dissected for better visualization and thus to makes a detailed
description of the structures of the organ of the C jacchus species.
RESULTS: The C jacchus heart is similar to that of other mammals, with small
anatomical modifications such as division of the apex by the interventricular
grooves, shallow fossa ovalis, and less salient intervenous tubercle.
CONCLUSIONS: This study may serve as taxonomic base for research and also as a
basis for clinical and surgical procedures with the C jacchus.

Psychosis and dyskinesia significantly diminish the quality of life of patients
with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD). Available treatment options are
unfortunately few and their use is limited by adverse effects. We have recently
shown that activation of metabotropic glutamate 2 and 3 (mGlu2/3) receptors
produced significant relief of L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA)-induced
psychosis-like behaviours (PLBs) and dyskinesia in experimental models of PD.
Here, using the highly-selective mGlu2 positive allosteric modulator (PAM)
LY-487,379, we seek to determine the contribution of selective mGlu2 activation
on both L-DOPA-induced PLBs and dyskinesia, in the
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-lesioned primate. We first
determined the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of LY-487,379 in the common marmoset,
following which we administered it (0.1, 1 and 10 mg/kg) or its vehicle to 6
MPTP-lesioned marmosets previously exposed to L-DOPA to elicit stable PLBs and
dyskinesia. We found that LY-487,379 provided a ≈45% reduction of the global PLBs
observed and reduced global dyskinesia score by ≈ 55%. Moreover, LY-487,379
enhanced the anti-parkinsonian effect of L-DOPA, by reducing global parkinsonian 
score by ≈ 15%. Our data suggest that selective mGlu2 positive allosteric
modulation with LY-487,379 may represent a potential therapeutic approach to
alleviate both L-DOPA-induced PLBs and dyskinesia in PD.

Common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is an attractive animal model primate
species for potential use in drug metabolism and pharmacokinetic studies. In this
study, marmoset cytochrome P450 (P450) 2S1, 4V2, 7A1, 7B1, 8B1, 24A1, 26A1, 26C1,
27A1, 39A1, and 51A1 cDNAs were isolated from marmoset tissues (brains, lungs,
livers, kidneys, and jejunums). Deduced amino acid sequences (89-98% homologous) 
of the marmoset P450 gene suggested similarity of molecular characteristics of
marmoset P450s to human counterparts, compared with those of pig, rabbit, and
rodents. Phylogenetic analysis using amino acid sequences indicated 11 marmoset
P450 forms clustered with those of human and other primate counterparts,
suggesting marmoset P450s have an evolutionary close relationship to human and
other primate counterparts. Tissue expression patterns of these P450 mRNAs except
for P450 7B1 mRNA were generally similar to those of human P450s in the five
tissue types analyzed. These results suggest similarity of molecular
characteristics for P450 2S1, 4V2, 7A1, 7B1, 8B1, 24A1, 26A1, 26C1, 27A1, 39A1,
and 51A1 between marmosets and humans, in addition to the orthologs of human P450
1, 2, 3, and 4 families previously identified and characterized in marmosets.

Through enabling an efficient supply of cells and tissues in the health sector on
demand, cryopreservation is increasingly becoming one of the mainstream
technologies in rapid translation and commercialization of regenerative medicine 
research. Cryopreservation of tissue-engineered constructs (TECs) is an emerging 
trend that requires the development of practically competitive biobanking
technologies. In our previous studies, we demonstrated that conventional
slow-freezing using dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) does not provide sufficient
protection of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) frozen in 3D
collagen-hydroxyapatite scaffolds. After simple modifications to a
cryopreservation protocol, we report on significantly improved cryopreservation
of TECs. Porous 3D scaffolds were fabricated using freeze-drying of a mineralized
collagen suspension and following chemical crosslinking. Amnion-derived MSCs from
common marmoset monkey Callithrix jacchus were seeded onto scaffolds in static
conditions. Cell-seeded scaffolds were subjected to 24 h pre-treatment with
100 mM sucrose and slow freezing in 10% Me2SO/20% FBS alone or supplemented with 
300 mM sucrose. Scaffolds were frozen 'in air' and thawed using a two-step
procedure. Diverse analytical methods were used for the interpretation of
cryopreservation outcome for both cell-seeded and cell-free scaffolds. In both
groups, cells exhibited their typical shape and well-preserved cell-cell and
cell-matrix contacts after thawing. Moreover, viability test 24 h post-thaw
demonstrated that application of sucrose in the cryoprotective solution preserves
a significantly greater portion of sucrose-pretreated cells (more than 80%) in
comparison to Me2SO alone (60%). No differences in overall protein structure and 
porosity of frozen scaffolds were revealed whereas their compressive stress was
lower than in the control group. In conclusion, this approach holds promise for
the cryopreservation of 'ready-to-use' TECs.

Abnormal saccadic eye movements can serve as biomarkers for patients with several
neuropsychiatric disorders. The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is becoming 
increasingly popular as a nonhuman primate model to investigate the cortical
mechanisms of saccadic control. Recently, our group demonstrated that
microstimulation in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) of marmosets elicits
contralateral saccades. Here we recorded single-unit activity in the PPC of the
same two marmosets using chronic microelectrode arrays while the monkeys
performed a saccadic task with gap trials (target onset lagged fixation point
offset by 200 ms) interleaved with step trials (fixation point disappeared when
the peripheral target appeared). Both marmosets showed a gap effect, shorter
saccadic reaction times (SRTs) in gap vs. step trials. On average, stronger
gap-period responses across the entire neuronal population preceded shorter SRTs 
on trials with contralateral targets although this correlation was stronger among
the 15% "gap neurons," which responded significantly during the gap. We also
found 39% "target neurons" with significant saccadic target-related responses,
which were stronger in gap trials and correlated with the SRTs better than the
remaining neurons. Compared with saccades with relatively long SRTs, short-SRT
saccades were preceded by both stronger gap-related and target-related responses 
in all PPC neurons, regardless of whether such response reached significance. Our
findings suggest that the PPC in the marmoset contains an area that is involved
in the modulation of saccadic preparation.NEW & NOTEWORTHY As a primate model in 
systems neuroscience, the marmoset is a great complement to the macaque monkey
because of its unique advantages. To identify oculomotor networks in the
marmoset, we recorded from the marmoset posterior parietal cortex during a
saccadic task and found single-unit activities consistent with a role in saccadic
modulation. This finding supports the marmoset as a valuable model for studying
oculomotor control.

BACKGROUND: For the diagnosis and treatment of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma
(ATLL) caused by human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) are required
therapeutic modalities urgently. Non-human primate models for ATLL would provide 
a valuable information for clinical studies. We did a pilot study to establish an
ATLL non-human primate model using common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus).
METHODS: We inoculated HTLV-1-producing MT-2 cells into 9-month-old marmosets,
either intraperitoneally or intravenously. We next administrated MT-2 cells into 
13-month-old marmosets under cyclosporine A (CsA) treatment to promote infection.
HTLV-1 infection was determined by measuring HTLV-1 antibody titer in the common 
marmosets.
RESULTS: The HTLV-1 antibody titer increased in the intraperitoneally inoculated 
marmoset with or without CsA treatment, and it kept over five 5 years though
proviral copy number (proviral load, PVL) remained low throughout the study.
CONCLUSION: We obtained HTLV-1 asymptomatic carriers of common marmosets by
inoculating MT-2 cells.

The blood-labyrinth barrier (BLB) is a major structure that separates the inner
ear from the systemic blood circulation. Many drugs cannot access the inner ear
because of their inability to cross the BLB. In the cochlea, the BLB is mainly
distributed in the lateral wall. However, the ultrastructure of the cochlear
lateral wall, including the distribution of tight junctions (TJs), which are its 
main component, has not been thoroughly examined in primates. This study
investigated the distribution of TJs in the cochlear lateral wall of the common
marmoset by performing immunohistochemistry for TJ markers and transmission
electron microscopy. As previously reported in rodents, TJs were distributed at
the lumenal side of stria marginal cells and basal cells. In outer sulcus cells, 
which are more developed in primates than in rodents, TJs were distributed at the
side with the endolymph but not at the side with the spiral ligament, where many 
capillaries were located. These findings indicate that drugs and small compounds 
circulating systemically in the blood can easily access outer sulcus cells, but
have a limited ability to enter endolymph. No structural differences were
detected between species, indicating that the in vivo distribution of drugs in
cochlear lateral wall cells, including outer sulcus cells, in primates can be
predicted by performing rodent experiments.

Visual motion processing is a well-established model system for studying neural
population codes in primates. The common marmoset, a small new world primate,
offers unparalleled opportunities to probe these population codes in key motion
processing areas, such as cortical areas MT and MST, because these areas are
accessible for imaging and recording at the cortical surface. However, little is 
currently known about the perceptual abilities of the marmoset. Here, we
introduce a paradigm for studying motion perception in the marmoset and compare
their psychophysical performance with human observers. We trained two marmosets
to perform a motion estimation task in which they provided an analog report of
their perceived direction of motion with an eye movement to a ring that
surrounded the motion stimulus. Marmosets and humans exhibited similar trade-offs
in speed versus accuracy: errors were larger and reaction times were longer as
the strength of the motion signal was reduced. Reverse correlation on the
temporal fluctuations in motion direction revealed that both species exhibited
short integration windows; however, marmosets had substantially less nondecision 
time than humans. Our results provide the first quantification of motion
perception in the marmoset and demonstrate several advantages to using analog
estimation tasks.

There has been a surge of interest in the structure and function of the mammalian
claustrum in recent years. However, most anatomical and physiological studies
treat the claustrum as a relatively homogenous structure. Relatively little
attention has been directed toward possible compartmentalization of the claustrum
complex into anatomical subdivisions, and how this compartmentalization is
reflected in claustrum connections with other brain structures. In this study, we
examined the cyto- and myelo-architecture of the claustrum of the common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus), to determine whether the claustrum contains internal
anatomical structures or compartments, which could facilitate studies focused on 
understanding its role in brain function. NeuN, Nissl, calbindin, parvalbumin,
and myelin-stained sections from eight adult marmosets were studied using light
microscopy and serial reconstruction to identify potential internal compartments.
Ultra high resolution (9.4T) post-mortem magnetic resonance imaging was employed 
to identify tractographic differences between identified claustrum
subcompartments by diffusion-weighted tractography. Our results indicate that the
classically defined marmoset claustrum includes at least two major subdivisions, 
which correspond to the dorsal endopiriform and insular claustrum nuclei, as
described in other species, and that the dorsal endopiriform nucleus (DEnD)
contains architecturally distinct compartments. Furthermore, the dorsal
subdivision of the DEnD is tractographically distinguishable from the insular
claustrum with respect to cortical connections.

The entorhinal cortex (EC) is associated with impaired cognitive function such as
in the case of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease.
The present study provides a detailed analysis of the cytoarchitectural and
myeloarchitectural organization of the EC in the common marmoset Callithrix
jacchus. Data were collected using Nissl and fiber stained preparations,
supplemented with acetylcholinesterase and parvalbumin immunohistochemistry. The 
EC layers and subfields in the marmoset seem to be architectonically similar to
those that have been proposed in nonhuman primates and humans to date; however,
slight differences could be revealed using the present techniques. Throughout its
rostrocaudal length, the entorhinal cortex presents a clear six-layered pattern. 
The entorhinal cortex is divided into six fields, named mainly in accordance to
their rostrocaudal and mediolateral positions. At rostral levels, the neurons
tend to be organized in patches that are surrounded by large, thick, radially
oriented bundles of fibers, and the deep layers are poorly developed. At caudal
levels, the divisions are more laminated in appearance. AChE staining at the
borders of adjacent fields are consistent with the changes in layering revealed
in Nissl-stained sections, of which the lateral regions of the EC display denser 
AChE staining than that of the medial banks. PV immunoreactivity was found in the
labeled somata, dendrites, and axons in all layers and subdivisions.
Additionally, we distinguished three subtypes of PV-immunoreactive neurons:
multipolar, bipolar and spherical-shaped neurons, based on the shape of the
somata and the disposition of the dendrites.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a New World monkey that has attracted
much attention as a potentially useful primate model for preclinical testing. A
total of 36 marmoset cytochrome P450 (P450) isoforms in the P450 1-51 subfamilies
have been identified and characterized by the application of genome analysis and 
molecular functional characterization. In this mini-review, we provide an
overview of the genomic structures, sequence identities, and substrate
selectivities of marmoset P450s compared with those of human P450s. Based on the 
sequence identity, phylogeny, and genomic organization of marmoset P450s,
orthologous relationships were established between human and marmoset P450s.
Twenty-four members of the marmoset P450 1A, 2A, 2B, 2C, 2D, 2E, 3A, 4A, and 4F
subfamilies shared high degrees of homology in terms of cDNA (>89%) and amino
acid sequences (>85%) with the corresponding human P450s; P450 2C76 was among the
exceptions. Phylogenetic analysis using amino acid sequences revealed that
marmoset P450s in the P450 1-51 families were located in the same clades as their
human and macaque P450 homologs. This finding underlines the evolutionary
closeness of marmoset P450s to their human and macaque homologs. Most marmoset
P450 1-4 enzymes catalyzed the typical drug-metabolizing reactions of the
corresponding human P450 homologs, except for some differences of P450 2A6 and
2B6. Consequently, it appears that the substrate specificities of enzymes in the 
P450 1-4 families are generally similar in marmosets and humans. The information 
presented here supports a better understanding of the functional characteristics 
of marmoset P450s and their similarities and differences with human P450s. It is 
hoped that this mini-review will facilitate the successful use of marmosets as
primate models in drug metabolism and pharmacokinetic studies.

BACKGROUND: Objective gait evaluation in humans is used as a predictive
disability outcome measure as well as an indicator for intervention
effectiveness. Parallel methods of gait analysis in nonhuman primate models are
essential for clinical translation. The goal of this study was to first assess
whether marmosets' gait data could be reliably collected in a Noldus CatWalk
XT10.6 and second, establish a testing protocol to assess gait and the
intraindividual variability during repeated testing.
NEW METHOD: The CatWalk, originally developed for rodents, was modified and used 
to assess gait in eight adult common marmoset monkeys across multiple days and
trials. Data was first analyzed to identify valid runs. Repeated measures ANOVA
was completed for the following gait measures: mean base of support, average
stride length, average swing time, and average stance time.
RESULTS: Raters had a high level of concurrence of usable data across all trials 
with successful trials including four consecutive hindfoot footfalls, during a
continuous, uninterrupted segment of walking. A significant main effect of time
(p < 0.000) but not rater (p = 0.98) was present with significant interactions
for time by subject (p < 0.000), but not rater per subject (p = 0.538), time
(p = 0.186), or three-way interaction (p = 0.297).
COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHOD(S): Gait has been assessed using force-plate and 
video data. The CatWalk allowed reproducible, automated and translational
locomotor data to be collected at multiple time points with detailed analyses
that identified a diagonal gait pattern.
CONCLUSIONS: The CatWalk system, similar to those used in humans, can be
effectively used to quantify spatiotemporal characteristics of gait in the common
marmoset.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an adult onset neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by the death of upper and lower motor neurons. About 10% of all ALS
cases are familial, and we have identified SOD1 and FUS mutations as the most
common causes in a consecutive series of 111 familial ALS pedigrees in Japan
(Nishiyama A, 2017). From studies of the TDP43, FUS, and C9orf72 genes,
perturbations of RNA processing can be highly adverse in motor neurons.
Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is one of the most potent survival-promoting
factors for motor neurons. We administered human recombinant HGF (hrHGF) by
continuous intrathecal delivery to transgenic rats at onset of paralysis for 4
weeks. Intrathecal administration of hrHGF attenuated motor neuron degeneration
and prolonged the duration of the disease by 63% (Ishigaki A, 2007). To translate
this strategy to human treatment, we induced a contusive cervical spinal cord
injury in the common marmoset, a primate, and then administered hrHGF
intrathecally. We conducted a first-in-human phase I trial of intrathecal hrHGF
in 15 Japanese patients with ALS (Warita H, 2019). Based on the results, we are
conducting a phase II trial of intrathecal hrHGF for patients with ALS.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is increasingly used as an animal model 
for biomedical research; however, gastrointestinal diseases causing significant
morbidity are endemic in many captive marmoset colonies. Establishing gut
microbiome patterns in a marmoset colony may aid in clinical decision-making and 
model reproducibility. A standardized method of sample collection and storage is 
essential for proper interpretation of microbiome data. While microbiome studies 
commonly utilize fecal samples, the goal of this study was to determine whether
the microbiome profile from a rectal swab performed on a sedated animal was
comparable to the microbiome profile from a fecal sample. During routine physical
exams, paired fecal and rectal swab samples were collected from each of 23
marmosets. DNA was extracted from all fecal and rectal swab samples and 16S
ribosomal RNA gene sequences were amplified and analyzed. Initial comparison of
the relative abundance of bacterial phyla between paired samples had a r2 value
of 0.70 with S of 0.08 with no significant differences in α and β diversity
metrics between fecal and rectal samples. Initial analysis however, revealed 5
discordant fecal-rectal pairs which corresponded only with the 5 rectal swabs
that were classified as free of visible fecal matter during collection. Exclusion
of these 5 pairs resulted in an optimized fit of the data as evidenced by a r2
value of 0.91 with S of 0.05. These results demonstrate that rectal swabs are a
reliable method for profiling the fecal microbiome in the marmoset since the
bacterial composition from a rectal swab with visible fecal contents correlated
well with the bacterial composition from a fecal sample from the same marmoset.
This study highlights the importance of standardized sample collection methods
and exclusion of inappropriate samples.

Humans and some animal species show flexibility in vocal production either
voluntarily or in response to environmental cues. Studies have shown rapid
spectrotemporal changes in speech or vocalizations during altered auditory
feedback in humans, songbirds and bats. Non-human primates, however, have long
been considered lacking the ability to modify spectrotemporal structures of their
vocalizations. Here we tested the ability of the common marmoset (Callithrix
jacchus), a highly vocal New World primate species to alter spectral and temporal
structures of their species-specific vocalizations in the presence of
perturbation signals. By presenting perturbation noises while marmosets were
vocalizing phee calls, we showed that they were able to change in real-time the
duration or spectral trajectory of an ongoing phee phrase by either terminating
it before its completion, making rapid shifts in fundamental frequency or in some
cases prolonging the duration beyond the natural range of phee calls. In some
animals, we observed fragmented phee calls which were not produced by marmosets
in their natural environment. Interestingly, some perturbation-induced changes
persisted even in the absence of the perturbation noises. These observations
provide further evidence that marmoset monkeys are capable of rapidly modulating 
their vocal structure and suggested potential voluntary vocal control by this
non-human primate species.

The ability to extract the direction of the other's gaze allows us to shift our
attention to an object of interest to the other and to establish joint attention.
By mapping one's own intentions on the object of joint attention, humans develop 
a Theory of (the other's) Mind (TOM), a functional sequence possibly disrupted in
autism. Gaze following of both humans and old world monkeys is orchestrated by
very similar cortical architectures, strongly suggesting homology. Also new world
monkeys, a primate suborder that split from the old world monkey line about 35
million years ago, have complex social structures and one member of this group,
the common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) are known to follow human head-gaze.
However, the question is if they use gaze following to establish joint attention 
with conspecifics. Here we show that this is indeed the case. In a free choice
task, head-restrained marmosets prefer objects gazed at by a conspecific and,
moreover, they exhibit considerably shorter choice reaction times for the same
objects. These findings support the assumption of an evolutionarily old domain
specific faculty shared within the primate order and they underline the potential
value of marmosets in studies of normal and disturbed joint attention.

Comment in
    Lab Anim (NY). 2020 Jan;49(1):18.

Optogenetics is now a fundamental tool for investigating the relationship between
neuronal activity and behavior. However, its application to the investigation of 
motor control systems in nonhuman primates is rather limited, because optogenetic
stimulation of cortical neurons in nonhuman primates has failed to induce or
modulate any hand/arm movements. Here, we used a tetracycline-inducible gene
expression system carrying CaMKII promoter and the gene encoding a
Channelrhodopsin-2 variant with fast kinetics in the common marmoset, a small New
World monkey. In an awake state, forelimb movements could be induced when
Channelrhodopsin-2-expressing neurons in the motor cortex were illuminated by
blue laser light with a spot diameter of 1 mm or 2 mm through a cranial window
without cortical invasion. Forelimb muscles responded 10 ms to 50 ms after
photostimulation onset. Long-duration (500 ms) photostimulation induced discrete 
forelimb movements that could be markerlessly tracked with charge-coupled device 
cameras and a deep learning algorithm. Long-duration photostimulation mapping
revealed that the primary motor cortex is divided into multiple domains that can 
induce hand and elbow movements in different directions. During performance of a 
forelimb movement task, movement trajectories were modulated by weak
photostimulation, which did not induce visible forelimb movements at rest, around
the onset of task-relevant movement. The modulation was biased toward the
movement direction induced by the strong photostimulation. Combined with calcium 
imaging, all-optical interrogation of motor circuits should be possible in
behaving marmosets.

Baseline locomotion and behavioral traits in the common marmoset Parkinson's
disease model were examined to provide basic information for preclinical
evaluations of medical treatments. A single regimen of
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine at a cumulative dose of 5 mg/kg as
the free base over three consecutive days was administered subcutaneously to 10
marmosets. Data obtained from these marmosets were compared to
pre-1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine levels or
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine free marmosets. After the single
regimen, reduced daily locomotion, a measure of immobility (a primary sign of
Parkinsonism), was observed for more than a year. A moving tremor was also
observed by visual inspection during this period. When apomorphine (0.13 mg/kg,
s.c.) was administered, either right or left circling behavior was observed in a 
cylindrical chamber in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine marmosets,
suggestive of unequal neural damage between the two brain hemispheres to
different extents. MRI revealed that T1 relaxation time in the right substantia
nigra correlated with right circling in
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine marmosets. Histology was supportive 
of dopaminergic neural loss in the striatum. These results increase our
understanding of the utility and limitations of the Parkinson's disease model in 
marmosets with a single 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine regimen, and
provide reference data for efficacious preclinical evaluations.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a non-human primate that provides
valuable models for neuroscience and aging research due to its anatomical
similarities to humans and relatively short lifespan. This study was carried out 
to examine whether aged marmosets develop glaucoma, as seen in humans. We found
that 11% of the aged marmosets presented with glaucoma-like characteristics; this
incident rate is very similar to that in humans. Magnetic resonance imaging
showed a significant volume loss in the visual cortex, and histological analyses 
confirmed the degeneration of the lateral geniculate nuclei and visual cortex in 
the affected marmosets. These marmosets did not have elevated intraocular
pressure, but showed an increased oxidative stress level, low cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF) pressure, and low brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and TrkB
expression in the retina, optic nerve head and CSF. Our findings suggest that
marmosets have potential to provide useful information for the research of eye
and the visual system.

Marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) are small non-human primates that are gaining
popularity in biomedical and preclinical research, including the neurosciences.
Phylogenetically, these animals are much closer to humans than rodents. They also
display complex behaviors, including a wide range of vocalizations and social
interactions. Here, an effective stereotaxic neurosurgical procedure for
implantation of recording electrode arrays in the common marmoset is described.
This protocol also details the pre- and postoperative steps of animal care that
are required to successfully perform such a surgery. Finally, this protocol shows
an example of local field potential and spike activity recordings in a freely
behaving marmoset 1 week after the surgical procedure. Overall, this method
provides an opportunity to study the brain function in awake and freely behaving 
marmosets. The same protocol can be readily used by researchers working with
other small primates. In addition, it can be easily modified to allow other
studies requiring implants, such as stimulating electrodes, microinjections,
implantation of optrodes or guide cannulas, or ablation of discrete tissue
regions.

Common marmosets have attracted considerable attention as a small standard
primate model in biomedical research. However, no marmoset diabetes model is
available. Here, we established a marmoset diabetes model via the combination of 
partial pancreatectomy and intravenous streptozotocin (STZ). A partial
pancreatectomy was performed in 11 common marmosets and multiple STZ doses were
intravenously administered. Diabetes was diagnosed upon sustained hyperglycaemia 
(nonfasting blood glucose level >200 mg/dl). Blood glucose and biochemistry were 
periodically assessed, in addition to glucose tolerance testing, continual blood 
glucose determination using a continuous glucose monitoring system, urine testing
and histological evaluation. In 8 of the 11 animals (73%), diabetes mellitus was 
induced. The diabetic marmosets also showed abnormal intravenous and oral glucose
tolerance test results. Blood glucose levels decreased in response to human
insulin administration. The hyperglycaemic state was irreversible and persisted
for more than 3 months, and the animals' condition was manageable via daily
insulin administration. Thus, diabetes can be successfully induced and maintained
in the common marmoset via partial pancreatectomy and STZ administration. This
protocol effectively generates a valuable animal model for studying disease
pathogenesis, risk factors and therapeutic interventions, including islet
transplantation.

The common marmoset (marmoset; Callithrix jacchus) harbors various desired
features as a non-human primate (NHP) model for neuroscience research. Recently, 
efforts have been made to induce neural cells in vitro from marmoset pluripotent 
stem cells (PSCs), including embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent 
stem cells (iPSCs), which are characterized by their capacity to differentiate
into all cell types from the three germ layers. Successful generation of marmoset
neural cells is not only invaluable for understanding neural development and for 
modeling neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders, but is also necessary for
the phenotypic screening of genetically-modified marmosets. However, differences 
in the differentiation propensity among PSC lines hamper the applicability and
the reproducibility of differentiation methods. To overcome this limitation, we
evaluated the efficacy of small molecules for neural differentiation of marmoset 
ESCs (cjESCs) and iPSCs using multiple differentiation methods. By immunochemical
and transcriptomic analyses, we confirmed that our methods using the small
molecules are efficient for various differentiation protocols by either enhancing
the yield of a mixture of neural cells including both neurons and glial cells, or
a pure population of neurons. Collectively, our findings optimized in vitro
neural differentiation methods for marmoset PSCs, which would ultimately help
enhance the utility of the animal model in neuroscience.

The frontal eye field (FEF) is a critical region for the deployment of overt and 
covert spatial attention. Although investigations in the macaque continue to
provide insight into the neural underpinnings of the FEF, due to its location
within a sulcus, the macaque FEF is virtually inaccessible to
electrophysiological techniques such as high-density and laminar recordings. With
a largely lissencephalic cortex, the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a
promising alternative primate model for studying FEF microcircuitry. Putative
homologies have been established with the macaque FEF on the basis of
cytoarchitecture and connectivity; however, physiological investigation in awake,
behaving marmosets is necessary to physiologically locate this area. Here, we
addressed this gap using intracortical microstimulation in a broad range of
frontal cortical areas in three adult marmosets (two males, one female). We
implanted marmosets with 96-channel Utah arrays and applied microstimulation
trains while they freely viewed video clips. We evoked short-latency fixed vector
saccades at low currents (<50 μA) in areas 45, 8aV, 8C, and 6DR. We observed a
topography of saccade direction and amplitude consistent with findings in
macaques and humans: small saccades in ventrolateral FEF and large saccades
combined with contralateral neck and shoulder movements encoded in dorsomedial
FEF. Our data provide compelling evidence supporting homology between marmoset
and macaque FEF and suggest that the marmoset is a useful primate model for
investigating FEF microcircuitry and its contributions to oculomotor and
cognitive functions.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The frontal eye field (FEF) is a
critical cortical region for overt and covert spatial attention. The
microcircuitry of this area remains poorly understood because in the macaque, the
most commonly used model, it is embedded within a sulcus and is inaccessible to
modern electrophysiological and imaging techniques. The common marmoset is a
promising alternative primate model due to its lissencephalic cortex and
potential for genetic manipulation. However, evidence for homologous cortical
areas in this model remains limited and unclear. Here, we applied
microstimulation in frontal cortical areas in marmosets to physiologically
identify FEF. Our results provide compelling evidence for an FEF in the marmoset 
and suggest that the marmoset is a useful model for investigating FEF
microcircuitry.

In our drug discovery program, we identified a novel orally available and
brain-penetrant phosphodiesterase (PDE) 1 inhibitor,
3-methyl-7-(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-4-yl)-2-{[trans-4-(trifluoromethyl)cyclohexyl]-me
thoxy}imidazo[5,1-f][1,2,4]triazin-4(3H)-one (DSR-141562). In the present study, 
we characterized the preclinical profile of DSR-141562. This compound has
preferential selectivity for predominantly brain-expressed PDE1B over other PDE1 
family members, and high selectivity for the PDE1 family over other PDE families 
and 65 other tested biologic targets. Oral administration of DSR-141562 at 10
mg/kg slightly elevated the cGMP concentration, and it potently enhanced the
increase of cGMP induced by a dopamine D1 receptor agonist in mouse brains. The
cGMP level in monkey cerebrospinal fluid was also elevated after treatment with
DSR-141562 at 30 and 100 mg/kg and could be used as a translational biomarker.
Since PDE1B is believed to regulate dopaminergic and glutamatergic signal
transduction, we evaluated the effects of this compound using
schizophrenia-related behavioral assays. DSR-141562 at 3-30 mg/kg potently
inhibited methamphetamine-induced locomotor hyperactivity in rats, while it had
only minimal effects on the spontaneous locomotor activity. Furthermore,
DSR-141562 at 1-100 mg/kg did not induce any signs of catalepsy in rats.
DSR-141562 at 0.3-3 mg/kg reversed social interaction and novel object
recognition deficits induced by repeated treatment with an N-methyl-D-aspartate
receptor antagonist, phencyclidine, in mice and rats, respectively. In common
marmosets, DSR-141562 at 3 and 30 mg/kg improved the performance in object
retrieval with detour tasks. These results suggest that DSR-141562 is a
therapeutic candidate for positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms in
schizophrenia. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This is the first paper showing that a
phosphodiesterase 1 inhibitor is efficacious in animal models for positive and
negative symptoms associated with schizophrenia. Furthermore, we demonstrated
that this compound improved cognitive function in the common marmoset, a nonhuman
primate.

Background: Recently, the use of common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) has
increased in biomedical research as an animal model. This study aimed to test
fecal samples to monitor bacterial and parasite infections in common marmoset at 
the Laboratory Animal Center of Osong Medical Innovation Foundation in Korea.
Methods: To monitor bacteria and parasites in common marmoset, we tested 43 fecal
samples of 43 common marmosets by culture and parasitological test in 2014.
Infection by Chilomastix mesnili was determined by PCR method.
Results: We identified nonpathogenic bacteria such as Proteus mirabilis and
Escherichia coli in feces of normal common marmosets. Interestingly, C. mesnili
was isolated from a healthy common marmoset by fecal centrifugation concentration
and PCR. The monkey infected with C. mesnili was treated with metronidazole.
After the treatment, C. mesnili were not found in feces using fecal
centrifugation concentration and PCR.
Conclusion: This is the first case report of C. mesnili infection in common
marmoset. Treatment with metronidazole is found to be highly effective in
eradicating C. mesnili infection in common marmoset.

Metformin has beneficial effects on several age-related diseases (e.g., diabetes,
obesity, cancer) and extends lifespan in nematodes and mice. Acarbose, an
FDA-approved agent for treating type 2 diabetes, prevents breakdown of complex
carbohydrates. Both compounds have been suggested as potential anti-aging
interventions and acarbose has been shown to extend mouse longevity by the
Intervention Testing Program (ITP). One potential next step is to assess the
effect of these interventions on healthspan and lifespan in non-human primates.
The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a small new world monkey with a
relatively short life span and small size, both valuable for the translation
potential of this nonhuman primate species for the study of aging and chronic
disease. However, the dosing and assessment of potential side effects of either
metformin or acarbose in this species have yet to be assessed. This study
evaluated the pharmacokinetics of two dosage levels each of metformin or acarbose
(given separately) in two small groups of young marmosets (n = 5/group) treated
for 24 h to define the pharmacokinetics of each drug. The ability to rapidly and 
reliably dose socially housed marmosets with an oral form of acarbose or
metformin that is well tolerated indicates that this species is a reliable model 
for testing acarbose and metformin in a safe and efficient way in a long-term
intervention.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a small-bodied New World primate
increasing in prominence as a model animal for neuroscience research. The
lissencephalic cortex of this primate species provides substantial advantages for
the application of electrophysiological techniques such as high-density and
laminar recordings, which have the capacity to advance our understanding of local
and laminar cortical circuits and their roles in cognitive and motor functions.
This is particularly the case with respect to the oculomotor system, as critical 
cortical areas of this network such as the frontal eye fields (FEF) and lateral
intraparietal area (LIP) lie deep within sulci in macaques. Studies of
cytoarchitecture and connectivity have established putative homologies between
cortical oculomotor fields in marmoset and macaque, but physiological
investigations of these areas, particularly in awake marmosets, have yet to be
carried out. Here we addressed this gap by probing the function of posterior
parietal cortex of the common marmoset with electrical microstimulation. We
implanted two animals with 32-channel Utah arrays at the location of the putative
area LIP and applied microstimulation while they viewed a video display and made 
untrained eye movements. Similar to previous studies in macaques, stimulation
evoked fixed-vector and goal-directed saccades, staircase saccades, and
eyeblinks. These data demonstrate that area LIP of the marmoset plays a role in
the regulation of eye movements, provide additional evidence that this area is
homologous with that of the macaque, and further establish the marmoset as a
valuable model for neurophysiological investigations of oculomotor and cognitive 
control.NEW & NOTEWORTHY The macaque monkey has been the preeminent model for
investigations of oculomotor control, but studies of cortical areas are limited, 
as many of these areas are buried within sulci in this species. Here we applied
electrical microstimulation to the putative area LIP of the lissencephalic cortex
of awake marmosets. Similar to the macaque, microstimulation evoked contralateral
saccades from this area, supporting the marmoset as a valuable model for studies 
of oculomotor control.

Pyrrole-imidazole (PI) polyamides are novel gene silencers that strongly bind the
promoter region of target genes in a sequence-specific manner to inhibit gene
transcription. We created a PI polyamide targeting human TGF-β1 (hTGF-β1). To
develop this PI polyamide targeting hTGF-β1 (Polyamide) as a practical medicine
for treating progressive renal diseases, we examined the effects of Polyamide in 
two common marmoset models of nephropathy. We performed lead optimization of PI
polyamides that targeted hTGF-β1 by inhibiting in a dose-dependent manner the
expression of TGF-β1 mRNA stimulated by PMA in marmoset fibroblasts. Marmosets
were housed and fed with a 0.05% NaCl and magnesium diet and treated with
cyclosporine A (CsA; 37.5 mg/kg/day, eight weeks) to establish chronic
nephropathy. We treated the marmosets with nephropathy with Polyamide (1
mg/kg/week, four weeks). We also established a unilateral urethral obstruction
(UUO) model to examine the effects of Polyamide (1 mg/kg/week, four times) in
marmosets. Histologically, the renal medulla from CsA-treated marmosets showed
cast formation and interstitial fibrosis in the renal medulla.
Immunohistochemistry showed strong staining of Polyamide in the renal medulla
from CsA-treated marmosets. Polyamide treatment (1 mg/kg/week, four times)
reduced hTGF-β1 staining and urinary protein excretion in CsA-treated marmosets. 
In UUO kidneys from marmosets, Polyamide reduced the glomerular injury score and 
tubulointerstitial injury score. Polyamide significantly suppressed hTGF-β1 and
snail mRNA expression in UUO kidneys from the marmosets. Polyamide effectively
improved CsA- and UUO-associated nephropathy, indicating its potential
application in the prevention of renal fibrosis in progressive renal diseases.

OBJECTIVE: Spinal cord injury remains an ailment with no comprehensive cure, and 
affected patients suffer from a greatly diminished quality of life. This large
population could significantly benefit from prosthetic technologies to replace
missing limbs, reanimate nonfunctional limbs, and enable new modes of
technologies to restore muscle control and function. While cortically driven
brain machine interfaces have achieved great success in interfacing with an
external device to restore lost functions, interfacing with the spinal cord can
provide an additional site to record motor control signals, which can have its
own advantages, despite challenges from using a smaller non-human primate (NHP)
model. The goal of this study is to develop such a spinal cord neural interface
to record motor signals from the high cervical levels of the spinal cord in a
common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) model. Approach and main results. Detailed
methods are discussed for this smaller NHP model that includes behavioral
training, surgical methods for electrode placement, connector placement and wire 
handling, electrode specifications and modifications for accessing high cervical 
level interneurons and motorneurons. The study also discusses the methods and
challenges involved in behavioral multi-channel extracellular recording from the 
marmoset spinal cord, including the major recording failure mechanisms
encountered during the study.
SIGNIFICANCE: Marmosets provide a good step between rodent and larger NHP models 
due to their small size, ease of handling, cognitive abilities, and similarities 
to other primate motor systems. The study shows the feasibility of recording
spinal cord signals and using marmosets as a smaller NHP model in behavioral
neuroscience studies. Interfacing with the spinal cord in chronically implanted
animals can provide useful information about how motor control signals within the
spinal cord are transformed to cause limb movements.

Saccadic tasks are often used to index aberrations of cognitive function in
patient populations, with several neuropsychiatric and neurologic disorders
characterized by saccadic dysfunction. The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus)
has received recent attention as an additional primate model for studying the
neural basis of these dysfunctions - marmosets are amenable to a host of genetic 
manipulation techniques and have a lissencephalic cortex, which is well suited
for a variety of recording techniques (e.g., calcium imaging, laminar
electrophysiology). Because the marmoset cortex is mostly lissencephalic,
however, the locations of frontal saccade-related regions (e.g., frontal eye
fields (FEF)) are less readily identified than in Old World macaque monkeys.
Further, although high quality histology-based atlases do exist for marmosets,
identifying these regions based on histology alone is not always accurate, with
the cytoarchitectonic boundaries often inconsonant with functional boundaries. As
such, there is a need to map the functional location of these regions directly.
Task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is of utility in this
regard, allowing for detection of whole-brain signal changes in response to
moving stimuli. Here, we conducted task-based fMRI in marmosets at ultra-high
field (9.4 T) during a free-viewing visuo-saccadic task. We also conducted the
same task in humans at ultra-high field (7 T) to validate that our simple task
was indeed evoking the visuo-saccadic circuitry we expected (as defined by a
meta-analysis of fMRI saccade studies). In the marmosets, we found that the task 
evoked a robust visuo-saccadic topology, with visual cortex (V1, V2, V3, V4)
activation extending ventrally to MT, MST, FST and dorsally into V6, 19M, 23V.
This topology also included putative cingulate eye field (area 32 and 24d),
posterior parietal cortex (with strongest activation in lateral intraparietal
area (LIP)), and a frontolateral peak in area 8 aV in marmosets, extending into
45, 46, 8aD, 6DR, 8c, 6 aV, 6DC. Overall, these results support the view that
marmosets are a promising preclinical modelling species for studying saccadic
dysfunction related to neuropsychiatric or neurodegenerative human brain
diseases.

Knock-in (KI) gene targeting can be employed for a wide range of applications in 
stem cell research. However, vectors for KI require multiple complicated
processes for construction, including multiple times of digestion/ligation steps 
and extensive restriction mapping, which has imposed limitations for the robust
applicability of KI gene targeting. To circumvent this issue, here we introduce
versatile and systematic methods for generating KI vectors by molecular cloning. 
In this approach, we employed the Multisite Gateway technology, an efficient in
vitro DNA recombination system using proprietary sequences and enzymes. KI vector
construction exploiting these methods requires only efficient steps, such as PCR 
and recombination, enabling robust KI gene targeting. We show that combinatorial 
usage of the KI vectors generated using this method and site-specific nucleases
enabled the precise integration of fluorescent protein genes in multiple loci of 
human and common marmoset (marmoset; Callithrix jacchus) pluripotent stem cells. 
The methods described here will facilitate the usage of KI technology and
ultimately help to accelerate stem cell research.

Preexisting neutralizing antibody (NAb) against human adenovirus serotype 5
(AdHu5) can reduce the immunogenicity of AdHu5 vector-based vaccine, thus
inhibiting the host's immune response and utility of other homologous vectors.
Common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a small new world primate, has attracted
considerable attention for its potential as a preclinical research model of
vaccine development. However, the prevalence of anti-AdHu5 NAb activity in common
marmosets bred in China remains unknown. A recombinant adenovirus expressing
luciferase and Zs Green reporter genes were constructed to detect NAb against
rAdHu5 by flow cytometry (FCM) and chemiluminescence (CL) assay. Five of 25
marmosets (20%) presented AdHu5 NAb detectable by FCM. Four animals had low titer
(1/16), while the fifth one reached 1/64. While by CL assay, 7 of 25 (28%)
marmosets were anti-AdHu5 NAb positive. Four animals, two of whom were negative
by FCM, also had low titer NAb (1/16), suggesting assay discrepancy at low
levels. Two marmosets, 1/32 titer by CL, were at 1/16 by FCM. A single animal
showed a high titer with both assays (1/128 and 1/64 by CL and FCM,
respectively). The CL method was simpler, more sensitive, accurate, and stable.
The low prevalence of preexisting anti-AdHu5 NAb in marmosets provides important 
background information on the feasibility and applicability of using marmosets as
a preclinical research model for vaccine development.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is one of the most widespread neurodevelopmental
disorders, characterized by impairment in social interactions, and restricted
stereotyped behaviors. Using immunohistochemistry and positron emission
tomography (PET), several studies have provided evidence of the existence of
activated microglia in ASD patients. Recently, we developed an animal model of
ASD using the new world monkey common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) and
demonstrated ASD-like social impairment after the in utero administration of
valproic acid (VPA). To characterize microglia in this marmoset model of ASD from
early toddler to adult, morphological analyses of microglia in VPA marmosets and 
age-matched unexposed (UE) marmosets were performed using immunohistochemistry
for microglia-specific markers, Iba1, and P2RY12. The most robust morphological
difference between VPA marmosets and UE marmosets throughout the life span
evaluated were the microglia processes in VPA marmosets being frequently
segmented by thin and faintly Iba1-positive structures. The segmentation of
microglial processes was only rarely observed in UE marmosets. This feature of
segmentation of microglial processes in VPA marmosets can also be observed in
images from previous studies on ASD conducted in humans and animal models.
Apoptotic cells have been shown to have segmented processes. Therefore, our
results might suggest that microglia in patients and animals with ASD symptoms
could frequently be in the apoptotic phase with high turnover rates of microglia 
found in some pathological conditions.

Critique of Pure Marmoset.

The common marmoset, a New World (platyrrhine) monkey, is currently being
fast-tracked as a non-human primate model species, especially for genetic
modification but also as a general-purpose model for research on the brain and
behavior bearing on the human condition. Compared to the currently dominant
primate model, the catarrhine macaque monkey, marmosets are notable for certain
evolutionary specializations, including their propensity for twin births, their
very small size (a result of phyletic dwarfism), and features related to their
small size (rapid development and relatively short lifespan), which result in
these animals yielding experimental results more rapidly and at lower cost.
Macaques, however, have their own advantages. Importantly, macaques are more
closely related to humans (which are also catarrhine primates) than are
marmosets, sharing approximately 20 million more years of common descent, and are
demonstrably more similar to humans in a variety of genomic, molecular, and
neurobiological characteristics. Furthermore, the very specializations of
marmosets that make them attractive as experimental subjects, such as their rapid
development and short lifespan, are ways in which marmosets differ from humans
and in which macaques more closely resemble humans. These facts warrant careful
consideration of the trade-offs between convenience and cost, on the one hand,
and biological realism, on the other, in choosing between non-human primate
models of human biology. Notwithstanding the advantages marmosets offer as
models, prudence requires continued commitment to research on macaques and other 
primate species.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a promising new model for study of
neurophysiological basis of behavior in primates. Like other primates, it relies 
on saccadic eye movements to monitor and explore its environment. Previous
reports have demonstrated some success in training marmosets to produce
goal-directed actions in the laboratory. However, the number of trials per
session has been relatively small, thus limiting the utility of marmosets as a
model for behavioral and neurophysiological studies. In this article, we report
the results of a series of new behavioral training and neurophysiological
protocols aimed at increasing the number of trials per session while recording
from the cerebellum. To improve the training efficacy, we designed a precisely
calibrated food regulation regime that motivates the subjects to perform saccade 
tasks, resulting in ~1,000 reward-driven trials on a daily basis. We then
developed a multichannel recording system that uses imaging to target a desired
region of the cerebellum, allowing for simultaneous isolation of multiple
Purkinje cells in the vermis. In this report, we describe 1) the design and
surgical implantation of a computer tomography (CT)-guided, subject-specific head
post, 2) the design of a CT- and MRI-guided alignment tool for trajectory
guidance of electrodes mounted on an absolute encoder microdrive, 3) development 
of a protocol for behavioral training of subjects, and 4) simultaneous recordings
from pairs of Purkinje cells during a saccade task.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Marmosets
present the opportunity to investigate genetically based neurological disease in 
primates, in particular, diseases that affect social behaviors, vocal
communication, and eye movements. All of these behaviors depend on the integrity 
of the cerebellum. We present training methods that better motivate the subjects,
allowing for improved performance, and we also present electrophysiological
techniques that precisely target the subject's cerebellum, allowing for
simultaneous isolation of multiple Purkinje cells.

The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine (FLX) is widely used to
treat depression and anxiety disorders. Chronic FLX treatment reportedly induces 
cellular responses in the brain, including increased adult hippocampal and
cortical neurogenesis and reversal of neuron maturation in the hippocampus,
amygdala, and cortex. However, because most previous studies have used rodent
models, it remains unclear whether these FLX-induced changes occur in the primate
brain. To evaluate the effects of FLX in the primate brain, we used
immunohistological methods to assess neurogenesis and the expression of neuronal 
maturity markers following chronic FLX treatment (3 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks) in
adult marmosets (n = 3 per group). We found increased expression of doublecortin 
and calretinin, markers of immature neurons, in the hippocampal dentate gyrus of 
FLX-treated marmosets. Further, FLX treatment reduced parvalbumin expression and 
the number of neurons with perineuronal nets, which indicate mature fast-spiking 
interneurons, in the hippocampus, but not in the amygdala or cerebral cortex. We 
also found that FLX treatment increased the generation of cortical interneurons; 
however, significant up-regulation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis was not
observed in FLX-treated marmosets. These results suggest that dematuration of
hippocampal neurons and increased cortical neurogenesis may play roles in
FLX-induced effects and/or side effects. Our results are consistent with those of
previous studies showing hippocampal dematuration and increased cortical
neurogenesis in FLX-treated rodents. In contrast, FLX did not affect hippocampal 
neurogenesis or dematuration of interneurons in the amygdala and cerebral cortex.

Specialization of the left and right hemispheres to control behavioural responses
may represent one of the mechanisms underlying individual differences in
personality structure, as well as the preferential use of one hand. The present
study investigated the relationship between personality and hand preference in
common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus), a little New World monkey that presents
highly consistent and stable individual hand preferences for simple reaching. To 
address this issue, data on 56 different behaviours from the species' behavioural
repertoire were measured in 10 different laboratory tests and during observations
under social conditions on 16 adult common marmosets. Stable behavioural
variables were aggregated a priori into 13 personality traits. Exploratory Factor
Analysis (EFA) on personality traits was carried out to verify the presence of
major personality factors, and their relationship with direction and strength of 
individual hand preferences was assessed by multiple regression, taking into
account sex and age of the subjects. The largest number of species-specific
behaviours so far investigated in this species was taken into account and robust 
temporal stability between two testing periods was verified. We confirm that
common marmosets are characterized by specific and stable personality profiles. A
single personality factor, accounting for about 38% of the total variance, was
found by EFA, that describes the interest towards unusual and new experiences and
resembles the human Openness domain. The strength of the hand preference was
found to be predicted by this personality factor, that we named Inquisitiveness. 
Present results highlight common marmoset as a useful primate model for the study
of the relationship between personality and lateralization.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a small New World non-human primate
indigenous to northeastern Brazil. This species has been attracting the attention
of biomedical researchers and neuroscientists for its ease of handling and colony
maintenance, unique behavioral characteristics, and several human-like traits,
such as enriched social vocal communication and strong relationships between
parents and offspring. Its high reproductive efficiency makes it particularly
amenable for use in the development of transgenic and genome editing technologies
in a non-human primate model. Our group has recently generated transgenic
marmosets with germ line transmission, opening new avenues in primate research.
In this chapter, we describe recent advances in neuroscience and disease research
using common marmosets, and we outline potential uses of genome editing in
non-human primates toward the development of knock-in/knock-out marmosets.

The objective of this study is to assess the response of telemetered common
marmosets to multiple cardiac ion channel inhibitors and to clarify the
usefulness of this animal model in evaluating the effects of drug candidates on
electrocardiogram (ECG). Six multiple cardiac ion channel inhibitors (sotalol,
astemizole, flecainide, quinidine, verapamil and terfenadine) were orally
administered to telemetered common marmosets and changes in QTc, PR interval and 
QRS duration were evaluated. Drugs plasma levels were determined to compare the
sensitivity in common marmosets to that in humans. QTc prolongation was observed 
in the marmosets dosed with sotalol, astemizole, flecainide, quinidine, verapamil
and terfenadine. PR prolongation was noted after flecainide and verapamil
administration, and QRS widening occurred following treatment with flecainide and
quinidine. Drugs plasma levels associated with ECG changes in marmosets were
similar to those in humans, except for verapamil-induced QTc prolongation.
Verapamil-induced change is suggested due to body temperature decrease. These
results indicate that telemetered common marmoset is a useful animal for
evaluation of the ECG effects of multiple cardiac ion channel inhibitors and the 
influence of body temperature change should be considered in the assessment.

Genetic variation in the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4) is associated with
vulnerability to affective disorders and pharmacotherapy efficacy. We recently
identified sequence polymorphisms in the common marmoset SLC6A4 repeat region
(AC/C/G and CT/T/C) associated with individual differences in anxiety-like trait,
gene expression, and response to antidepressants. The mechanisms underlying the
effects of these polymorphisms are unknown, but a key mediator of serotonin
action is the serotonin 2A receptor (5HT2A). Thus, we correlated 5HT2A binding
potential (BP) and RNA gene expression in 16 SLC6A4 genotyped marmosets with
responsivity to 5HT2A antagonism during the human intruder test of anxiety.
Voxel-based analysis and RNA measurements showed a reduction in 5HT2A BP and gene
expression specifically in the right posterior insula of individuals homozygous
for the anxiety-related variant AC/C/G. These same marmosets displayed an
anxiogenic, dose-dependent response to the human intruder after 5HT2A
pharmacological antagonism, while CT/T/C individuals showed no effect. A
voxel-based correlation analysis, independent of SLC6A4 genotype, revealed that
5HT2A BP in the adjacent right anterior insula and insula proisocortex was
negatively correlated with trait anxiety scores. Moreover, 5HT2A BP in both
regions was a good predictor of the size and direction of the acute emotional
response to the human intruder threat after 5HT2A antagonism. Our findings
suggest that genetic variation in the SLC6A4 repeat region may contribute to the 
trait anxious phenotype via neurochemical changes in brain areas implicated in
interoceptive and emotional processing, with a critical role for the right insula
5HT2A in the regulation of affective responses to threat.

[Prion-like Propagation of Pathological α-Synuclein in Vivo].

[Article in Japanese]

α-Synuclein (αS) is the major component of the filamentous inclusions that
constitute the defining characteristic of neurodegenerative synucleinopathies,
including Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and multiple system
atrophy. αS is deposited in a hyperphosphorylated and ubiquitinated form with a
β-sheet-rich fibrillar structure in diseased brains. In 2008, some researchers
reported that embryonic neurons transplanted into Parkinson's disease brains had 
Lewy body-like pathologies, suggesting that pathological αS propagates from
diseased neurons to young neurons. Subsequently, a growing body of evidence
supported the cell-to-cell spread of αS pathologies. Recent studies have revealed
that intracerebral injection of insoluble αS into wild-type mice can induce
prion-like propagation of phosphorylated αS pathology even 1 month after
injection, while injection into αS-knockout mice failed to induce any pathology. 
We also showed that intracerebral injection of insoluble αS into adult common
marmoset brains results in the spreading of abundant αS pathology. These in vivo 
experiments clearly indicate that insoluble αS has prion-like properties and that
it propagates through neural networks. The underlying mechanisms of αS
propagation are still poorly understood, but αS propagation model animals could
be helpful in elucidating the pathogenetic mechanisms and developing drugs for
synucleinopathies.

Recent studies have indicated that direct administration of viral vectors or
small compounds to the inner ear may aid in the treatment of Sensorineural
hearing loss (SNHL). However, due to species differences between humans and
rodents, translating experimental results into clinical applications remains
challenging. The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a New World monkey, is
considered a pre-clinical animal model. In the present study, we describe
morphometric data acquired from the temporal bone of the common marmoset in order
to define the routes of topical drug administration to the inner ear. Dissection 
and diffusion tensor tractography (DTT) were performed on the fixed cadaverous
heads of 13 common marmosets. To investigate potential routes for drug
administration to the inner ear, we explored the anatomy of the round window,
oval window (OW), semicircular canal, and endolymphatic sac (ES). Among these,
the approach via the round window with posterior tympanotomy appeared feasible
for delivering drugs to the inner ear without manipulating the tympanic membrane,
minimizing the chances of conductive hearing loss. The courses of four critical
nerves [including the facial nerve (FN)] were visualized using three-dimensional 
(3D) DTT, which may help to avoid nerve damage during surgery. Finally, to
investigate the feasibility of actual drug administration, we measured the volume
of the round window niche (RWN), which was approximately 0.9 μL. The present
findings may help to establish experimental standards for evaluating new
therapies in this primate model.

Although wasting marmoset syndrome (WMS) is one of the biggest problems facing
captive marmoset colonies, the mechanisms underlying its pathogenesis remain
unclear. In our clinical experience, it is difficult to cure WMS-affected
marmosets with severe hypoalbuminemia. Thus, the mechanisms underlying
hypoalbuminemia in WMS must be understood. In the present study, we investigated 
whether intestinal protein loss, a known reason for hypoalbuminemia, occurs in
this disease. Fecal α1-proteinase inhibitor (α1-PI, also known as α1-antitrypsin)
has been used to diagnose intestinal protein loss in other species. To develop an
assay system for this protein, marmoset α1-PI was purified from plasma and
antibodies against it were developed using the purified protein. Using the
antibodies, a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to measure
marmoset α1-PI was developed, and its detection sensitivity for fecal samples was
∼20-fold higher than that of a commercial kit for human α1-PI. From this ELISA,
the reference intervals for serum and feces of healthy marmosets were 0.87-1.85
mg/ml and 0.53-395.58 μg/g, respectively. The average concentrations of α1-PI in 
serum and feces of seven WMS-affected marmosets were 1.17 mg/ml and 1357.58 μg/g,
respectively. Although there were no significant differences in the serum
concentrations between healthy and WMS-affected marmosets, the fecal
concentrations were significantly higher in WMS-affected marmosets than in
healthy individuals, suggesting that intestinal protein loss occurs in WMS.
Intestinal protein loss of WMS-affected marmosets was significantly attenuated
with treatment, suggesting that it is one of the mechanisms involved in the
hypoalbuminemia observed in WMS.

The biology of fertility, early development, and pregnancy is variable across
mammalian species. In addition, while the physiology and pathophysiology of human
diseases can be investigated in other animal models (principally, rodents),
differences between human and lower mammals often present limitations in the
applicability of physiological processes from rodent models to human biology.
Since 1984, when the first live birth from rhesus monkey in vitro fertilization
and embryo transfer was reported (Bavister et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci
81:2218-2222, 1984), there has been progress in the implementation of assisted
reproductive technologies with several nonhuman primate (NHP) species that play
important roles in biomedical research. In recent years, the significance of this
progress has been amplified by the development of genomic editing approaches for 
facile genetic manipulation of the embryo, including methods now applied to NHPs 
(Liu et al., Cell Stem Cell 14:323-328, 2014; Niu et al., Cell 156:836-843,
2014). In this review, we summarize current protocols and practices for the
common marmoset. It is our intention to provide current state-of-the-art
protocols for gamete procurement and in vitro fertilization techniques, so that
laboratories wishing to implement experimental embryology in marmoset models will
have a basic set of tools with which to initiate such studies.

VIIq31.

Sajuthi D, Tosi AJ.

Human chromosome 7 has been the focus of many behavioral, genetic, and medical
studies because it carries genes related to cancer and neurodevelopment. We
examined the evolution of the chromosome 7 homologs, and the 7q31 region in
particular, using chromosome painting analyses and 3 paint probes derived from
(i) the whole of chimpanzee chromosome VII (wcVII), (ii) human 7q31 (h7q31), and 
(iii) the chimpanzee homolog VIIq31 (cVIIq31). The wcVII probe was used instead
of the whole human chromosome 7 because the chimpanzee contains additional
C-bands and revealed large areas of synteny conservation as well as fragmentation
across 20 primate species. Analyses focusing specifically on the 7q31 homolog and
vicinity revealed considerable conservation across lineages with 2 exceptions.
First, the probes verified an insertion of repetitive sequence at VIIq22 in
chimpanzees and bonobos and also detected the sequence in most subtelomeres of
the African apes. Second, a paracentric inversion with a breakpoint in the
cVIIq31 block was found in the common marmoset, confirming earlier studies.
Subsequent in silico comparative genome analysis of 17 primate species revealed
that VIIq31.1 is more significantly conserved at the sequence level than other
regions of chromosome VII, which indicates that its components are likely
responsible for critical shared traits across the order, including conditions
necessary for proper human development and wellbeing.

The common marmoset is a small nonhuman primate in which the application of
transgenesis and genetic knockout techniques allows the generation of
gene-modified models of human diseases. However, its longer generation time than 
that of rodents is a major obstacle to the widespread use of gene-modified
marmosets for biomedical research. In this study, we examined the feasibility of 
shortening the generation time by using prepubertal marmoset males as gamete
donors. We collected late round stage spermatids (Steps 5-7), elongated
spermatids, and testicular spermatozoa from the testis of a prepubertal
11-month-old male marmoset and injected them into in vitro-matured oocytes. After
7 days in culture, two embryos from elongated spermatid injection and two embryos
from sperm injection were transferred into two separate recipient females. The
recipient female that received elongated spermatid injection-derived embryos
became pregnant and gave birth to one female infant. This is the first
demonstration that a spermatid from a prepubertal male primate can support
full-term development. Using this method, we can expect to obtain offspring of
gene-modified males 6 months to a year earlier than with natural mating.

A novel Bifidobacterium strain, MRM 9.3T, was isolated from a faecal sample of a 
baby common marmoset (Callithrixjacchus). Cells were Gram-stain-positive,
non-motile, non-sporulating, non-haemolytic, facultatively anaerobic and fructose
6-phosphate phosphoketolase-positive. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA
genes as well as multilocus sequences (representing hsp60, rpoB, clpC, dnaJ and
dnaG genes) and the core genomes revealed that strain MRM 9.3T exhibited
phylogenetic relatedness to Bifidobacterium myosotis DSM 100196T. Comparative
analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences confirmed the phylogenetic results showing
the highest gene sequence identity with strain B.ifidobacterium myosotis DSM
100196T (95.6 %). The average nucleotide identity, amino acid average identity
and in silico DNA-DNA hybridization values between MRM 9.3T and DSM 100196T were 
79.9, 72.1 and 28.5 %, respectively. Phenotypic and genotypic features clearly
showed that the strain MRM 9.3T represents a novel species, for which the name
Bifidobacterium jacchi sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is MRM 9.3T (=DSM
103362T =JCM 31788T).

The common marmoset (marmoset; Callithrix jacchus) shows anatomical and
physiological features that are in common with humans. Establishing induced
pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from marmosets holds promise for enhancing the
utility of the animal model for biomedical and preclinical studies. However, in
spite of the presence of some previous reports on marmoset iPSCs, the
reprogramming technology in marmosets is still under development. In particular, 
the efficacy of RNA-based reprogramming has not been thoroughly investigated. In 
this study, we attempted RNA-based reprogramming for deriving iPSCs from marmoset
fibroblasts. Although we failed to derive iPSC colonies from marmoset fibroblasts
by using a conventional RNA-based reprogramming method previously validated in
human fibroblasts, we succeeded in deriving colony-forming cells with a modified 
induction medium supplemented with a novel set of small molecules. Importantly,
following one-week culture of the colony-forming cells in conventional embryonic 
stem cell (ESC) medium, we obtained iPSCs which express endogenous pluripotent
markers and show a differentiation potential into all three germ layers. Taken
together, our results indicate that RNA-based reprogramming, which is valuable
for deriving transgene-free iPSCs, is applicable to marmosets.

Tau is a microtubule-associated protein expressed in neuronal axons.
Hyperphosphorylated tau is a major component of neurofibrillary tangles, a
pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Hyperphosphorylated tau
aggregates are also found in many neurodegenerative diseases, collectively
referred to as "tauopathies," and tau mutations are associated with familial
frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Previous studies have generated
transgenic mice with mutant tau as tauopathy models, but nonhuman primates, which
are more similar to humans, may be a better model to study tauopathies. For
example, the common marmoset is poised as a nonhuman primate model for
investigating the etiology of age-related neurodegenerative diseases. However, no
biochemical studies of tau have been conducted in marmoset brains. Here, we
investigated several important aspects of tau, including expression of different 
tau isoforms and its phosphorylation status, in the marmoset brain. We found that
marmoset tau does not possess the "primate-unique motif" in its N-terminal
domain. We also discovered that the tau isoform expression pattern in marmosets
is more similar to that of mice than that of humans, with adult marmoset brains
expressing only four-repeat tau isoforms as in adult mice but unlike in adult
human brains. Of note, tau in brains of marmoset newborns was phosphorylated at
several sites associated with AD pathology. However, in adult marmoset brains,
much of this phosphorylation was lost, except for Ser-202 and Ser-404
phosphorylation. These results reveal key features of tau expression and
phosphorylation in the marmoset brain, a potentially useful nonhuman primate
model of neurodegenerative diseases.

Evidence of an age-related increase of β-synuclein (SNCB) in several parts of the
visual system including the retina has been reported. SNCB is thought to function
as an antagonist of α-synuclein in neurodegenerative diseases, but the exact role
of SNCB remains unclear. The presented work studies two different aspects of the 
onset and role of SNCB in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). First, the
topographical and intracellular distributions of SNCB in the RPE of non-human
marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus) were evaluated in paraffin-embedded eyes and
RPE whole mounts from different developmental stages (neonatal, adolescent, and
adult). Thus, revealed distinct lifetime-related alterations of the topographical
and intracellular distributions of SNCB in the primate macula compared to the
retinal periphery. Furthermore, the function and influences of SNCB on
ARPE-19 cells and primary porcine RPE (ppRPE) cells were characterized by
exposing these cells with recombinant SNCB (rSNCB) at different concentrations.
Moreover, apoptosis, protein- and mRNA-expression levels of factors of the
p53/MDM2 signaling cascade and inflammation- and oxidation-related genes were
investigated. The observed dose-depended decreased apoptosis rates together with 
the PLD2 mediated activation of the p53 pathway promotes senescence-related
processes in SNCB exposed common ARPE-19 cells from human origin. Further,
increased HMOX1 and NOX4 levels indicate increased oxidative stress and
inflammatory responses triggered by SNCB. The obtained differences in the
distribution of SNCB in primate RPE together with alterations of cellular
functions in rSNCB-exposed RPE cells (e.g., ARPE-19, ppRPE) support SNCB-related 
effects like inflammatory response and stress-related properties on RPE over
lifetime. The possible functional relevance of SNCB in physiological aging
converting into a pathophysiological condition should be investigated in further 
studies.

Staphylococcal enterotoxins (SEs) produced by Staphylococcus aureus are known as 
causative agents of emetic food poisoning. We previously demonstrated that SEA
binds with submucosal mast cells and evokes mast cell degranulation in a small
emetic house musk shrew model. Notably, primates have been recognized as the
standard model for emetic assays and analysis of SE emetic activity. However, the
mechanism involved in SEA-induced vomiting in primates has not yet been
elucidated. In the present study, we established common marmosets as an emetic
animal model. Common marmosets were administered classical SEs, including SEA,
SEB and SEC, and exhibited multiple vomiting responses. However, a non-emetic
staphylococcal superantigen, toxic shock syndrome toxin-1, did not induce emesis 
in these monkeys. These results indicated that the common marmoset is a useful
animal model for assessing the emesis-inducing activity of SEs. Furthermore,
histological analysis uncovered that SEA bound with submucosal mast cells and
induced mast cell degranulation. Additionally, ex vivo and in vivo
pharmacological results showed that SEA-induced histamine release plays a
critical role in the vomiting response in common marmosets. The present results
suggested that 5-hydroxytryptamine also plays an important role in the
transmission of emetic stimulation on the afferent vagus nerve or central nervous
system. We conclude that SEA induces histamine release from submucosal mast cells
in the gastrointestinal tract and that histamine contributes to the SEA-induced
vomiting reflex via the serotonergic nerve and/or other vagus nerve.

Induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells hold great promise for regenerative medicine
and the treatment of various diseases. Before proceeding to clinical trials, it
is important to test the efficacy and safety of iPS cell-based treatments using
experimental animals. The common marmoset is a new world monkey widely used in
biomedical studies. However, efficient methods that could generate iPS cells from
a variety of cells have not been established. Here, we report that marmoset cells
are efficiently reprogrammed into iPS cells by combining RNA transfection and
chemical compounds. Using this novel combination, we generate transgene
integration-free marmoset iPS cells from a variety of cells that are difficult to
reprogram using conventional RNA transfection method. Furthermore, we show this
is similarly effective for human and cynomolgus monkey iPS cell generation. Thus,
the addition of chemical compounds during RNA transfection greatly facilitates
reprogramming and efficient generation of completely integration-free safe iPS
cells in primates, particularly from difficult-to-reprogram cells.

As a primate animal model for neuroscience research, the common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus) provides an unprecedented opportunity to gain a better
understanding of the human brain function and pathophysiology of neurological and
psychiatric disorders, thereby helping in the diagnosis and treatment of those
disorders. The marmoset is particularly useful in studying the neural mechanisms 
underlying social behavior, as their prosocial behavior and visual and vocal
communication systems are well-developed. Despite recent advances in
biotechnology such as the creation of genetically engineered marmosets, our
understanding of the marmoset brain, including its dysfunction in disease, at the
circuit level remains limited due to the lack of comprehensive knowledge of the
neuronal connections in the marmoset brain. Here we describe the development of
genetic and viral engineering techniques for a particular type of neuron in
non-transgenic animals. These approaches, combined with rabies viral tracing,
imaging, and electrophysiology, will make it possible to map the connectome and
relate neuronal connectivity to function in the marmoset brain. Such
circuit-level studies will open a new avenue for non-human primate research that 
can bridge the gap between basic research and human studies.

The genetic and biological similarity between non-human primates and humans has
ensured the continued use of primates in biomedical research where other species 
cannot be used. Health-monitoring programmes for non-human primates provide an
approach to monitor and control both endemic and incoming agents that may cause
zoonotic and anthroponotic disease or interfere with research outcomes. In 1999
FELASA recommendations were published which aimed to provide a harmonized
approach to health monitoring programmes for non-human primates. Scientific and
technological progress, understanding of non-human primates and evolving
microbiology has necessitated a review and replacement of the current
recommendations. These new recommendations are aimed at users and breeders of the
commonly used non-human primates; Macaca mulatta (Rhesus macaque) and Macaca
fascicularis (Cynomolgus macaque). In addition, other species including
Callithrix jacchus (Common marmoset) Saimiri sciureus (Squirrel monkey) and
others are included. The important and challenging aspects of non-human primate
health-monitoring programmes are discussed, including management protocols to
maintain and improve health status, health screening strategies and procedures,
health reporting and certification. In addition, information is provided on
specific micro-organisms and the recommended frequency of testing.

Two strictly anaerobic strains (MB11T and MB56) were isolated from common
marmoset (Callithrixjacchus) faeces. Cells of the two strains were
Gram-stain-negative, pleomorphic short (strain MB11T) or long (strain MB56) rods.
Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that both
isolates were related to the genus Phascolarctobacterium. They had 16S rRNA gene 
sequences similarities lower than 93 % to previously described species,
Phascolarctobacterium faecium ACM 3679T and Phascolarctobacterium succinatutens
YIT 12067T, and 98.7 % between themselves. DNA-DNA hybridization values showed
that strains MB11T and MB56 were the same species. The genomic DNA G+C content of
strains MB11T and MB56 were 47.3-47.4 mol% and 47.7-48.0 mol%. The isolates had
different enzymatic activities compared with P. succinatutens JCM 16074T and
different major cellular fatty acids compared with P. faecium ACM 3679T.
Substrate availability revealed that they utilized not only succinate, but also
pyruvate. With pyruvate supplementation, they produced both propionate and
acetate, while only propionate production occured with succinate. As suggested by
the phylogenic and physiological properties of strains MB11T and MB56, we propose
the name Phascolarctobacteriumwakonense sp. nov. with the type strain MB11T (=JCM
32899T=DSM 107697T).

Current neuroprosthetics rely on stable, high quality recordings from chronically
implanted microelectrode arrays (MEAs) in neural tissue. While chronic
electrophysiological recordings and electrode failure modes have been reported
from rodent and larger non-human primate (NHP) models, chronic recordings from
the marmoset model have not been previously described. The common marmoset is a
New World primate that is easier to breed and handle compared to larger NHPs and 
has a similarly organized brain, making it a potentially useful smaller NHP model
for neuroscience studies. This study reports recording stability and signal
quality of MEAs chronically implanted in behaving marmosets. Six adult male
marmosets, trained for reaching tasks, were implanted with either a 16-channel
tungsten microwire array (five animals) or a Pt-Ir floating MEA (one animal) in
the hand-arm region of the primary motor cortex (M1) and another MEA in the
striatum targeting the nucleus accumbens (NAcc). Signal stability and quality was
quantified as a function of array yield (active electrodes that recorded action
potentials), neuronal yield (isolated single units during a recording session),
and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Out of 11 implanted MEAs, nine provided
functional recordings for at least three months, with two arrays functional for
10 months. In general, implants had high yield, which remained stable for up to
several months. However, mechanical failure attributed to MEA connector was the
most common failure mode. In the longest implants, signal degradation occurred,
which was characterized by gradual decline in array yield, reduced number of
isolated single units, and changes in waveform shape of action potentials. This
work demonstrates the feasibility of longterm recordings from MEAs implanted in
cortical and deep brain structures in the marmoset model. The ability to
chronically record cortical signals for neural prosthetics applications in the
common marmoset extends the potential of this model in neural interface research.

The amygdaloid complex (AC) is a heterogeneous aggregate of nuclei located in the
rostromedial region of the temporal lobe. In addition to being partly connected
among themselves, the AC nuclei are strongly interconnected with the cerebral
cortex, striatum, basal forebrain, hypothalamus and brainstem. Animal and human
functional studies have established that the AC is a central hub of the neuronal 
networks supporting emotional responsivity, particularly its negative/aversive
components. Dysfunction of AC circuits in humans has been implicated in anxiety, 
depression, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. The small New-World marmoset
monkey (Callithrix jacchus) has recently become a key model for neuroscience
research. However, the nuclear and fiber tract organization of marmoset AC has
not been examined in detail. Thus, the extent to which it can be compared to the 
AC of Old-World (human and macaque) primates is yet unclear. Here, using Nissl
and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) histochemical stains as a reference, we analyzed 
the cytoarchitecture and nuclear parcellation of the marmoset AC. In addition,
given the increasing relevance of tractographic localization for high-resolution 
in vivo imaging studies in non-human primates, we also identified the myelin
fiber tracts present within and around the AC as revealed by the Gallyas method. 
The present study provides a detailed atlas of marmoset AC. Moreover, it reveals 
that, despite phylogenetic distance and brain size differences, every nucleus and
myelinated axon bundle described in human and macaque studies can be confidently 
recognized in marmosets.

In autism spectrum disorder (ASD), disrupted functional and structural
connectivity in the social brain has been suggested as the core biological
mechanism underlying the social recognition deficits of this neurodevelopmental
disorder. In this study, we aimed to identify genetic and neurostructural
abnormalities at birth in a non-human primate model of ASD, the common marmoset
with maternal exposure to valproic acid (VPA), which has been reported to display
social recognition deficit in adulthood. Using a comprehensive gene expression
analysis, we found that 20 genes were significantly downregulated in VPA-exposed 
neonates. Of these, Frizzled3 (FZD3) and PIK3CA were identified in an axon
guidance signaling pathway. FZD3 is essential for the normal development of the
anterior commissure (AC) and corpus callosum (CC); hence, we performed diffusion 
tensor magnetic resonance imaging with a 7-Tesla scanner to measure the
midsagittal sizes of these structures. We found that the AC size in VPA-exposed
neonates was significantly smaller than that in age-matched controls, while the
CC size did not differ. These results suggest that downregulation of the genes
related to axon guidance and decreased AC size in neonatal primates may be linked
to social brain dysfunctions that can happen later in life.

BACKGROUND: Callithrix jacchus, generally known as the common marmoset, has
recently garnered interest as an experimental primate model for better
understanding the basis of human social behavior, architecture and function.
Modelling human neurological and psychological diseases in marmosets can enhance 
the knowledge obtained from rodent research for future pre-clinical studies.
Hence, comprehensive and quantitative assessments of marmoset behaviors are
crucial. However, systems for monitoring and analyzing marmoset behaviors have
yet to be established.
NEW METHOD: In this paper, we present a novel multimodal system, MarmoDetector,
for the automated 3D analysis of marmoset behavior under freely moving
conditions. MarmoDetector allows the quantitative assessment of marmoset
behaviors using computerised tracking analysis techniques that are based on a
Kinect system equipped with video recordings, infrared images and depth analysis.
RESULTS: Using MarmoDetector, we assessed behavioral circadian rhythms
continuously over several days in home cages. In addition, MarmoDetector detected
acute, transient complex behaviors of alcohol injected marmosets.
COMPARISON TO EXISTING METHOD: Compared to 2D recording, MarmoDetector detects
activities more precisely and is very sensitive as we could detect behavioral
defects specifically induced by alcohol administration.
CONCLUSION: MarmoDetector facilitates the rapid and accurate analysis of marmoset
behavior and will enhance research on the neural basis of brain disorders.

In November 2015, an 83-d-old juvenile male common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) 
in good body condition was found dead in his family cage with no previous
premonitory signs. Necropsy revealed a gas-distended abdomen, feces-distended
large bowel, and a full-thickness distal colonic perforation resulting in fecal
peritonitis. The distal colon ended in a blind pouch at 7 mm prior to the
expected anal opening, consistent with atresia ani. Here we present this case,
briefly discuss the human and veterinary literature regarding correction of
anorectal malformations, and highlight the importance of identifying such
devastating congenital defects in breeding colonies while limiting the disruption
and handling of seemingly healthy, young NHP raised in a complex social setting.

Platy-1 elements are Platyrrhine-specific, short interspersed elements originally
discovered in the Callithrix jacchus (common marmoset) genome. To date, only the 
marmoset genome has been analyzed for Platy-1 repeat content. Here, we report
full-length Platy-1 insertions in other New World monkey (NWM) genomes (Saimiri
boliviensis, squirrel monkey; Cebus imitator, capuchin monkey; and Aotus
nancymaae, owl monkey) and analyze the amplification dynamics of lineage-specific
Platy-1 insertions. A relatively small number of full-length and lineage-specific
Platy-1 elements were found in the squirrel, capuchin, and owl monkey genomes
compared with the marmoset genome. In addition, only a few older Platy-1
subfamilies were recovered in this study, with no Platy-1 subfamilies younger
than Platy-1-6. By contrast, 62 Platy-1 subfamilies were discovered in the
marmoset genome. All of the lineage-specific insertions found in the squirrel and
capuchin monkeys were fixed present. However, ∼15% of the lineage-specific
Platy-1 loci in Aotus were polymorphic for insertion presence/absence. In
addition, two new Platy-1 subfamilies were identified in the owl monkey genome
with low nucleotide divergences compared with their respective consensus
sequences, suggesting minimal ongoing retrotransposition in the Aotus genus and
no current activity in the Saimiri, Cebus, and Sapajus genera. These comparative 
analyses highlight the finding that the high number of Platy-1 elements
discovered in the marmoset genome is an exception among NWM analyzed thus far,
rather than the rule. Future studies are needed to expand upon our knowledge of
Platy-1 amplification in other NWM genomes.

Marmosets are small New World primates that are posited to become an important
preclinical animal model for studying intractable human brain diseases. A
critical step in the development of marmosets as a viable model for human brain
dysfunction is to characterize brain networks that are homologous with human
network topologies. In this regard, the use of functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) holds tremendous potential for functional brain mapping in
marmosets. Although possible, implementation of hardware for fMRI in awake
marmosets (free of the confounding effects of anesthesia) is not trivial due to
the technical challenges associated with developing specialized imaging hardware.
Here, we describe the design and implementation of a marmoset holder and
head-fixation system with an integrated receive coil for awake marmoset fMRI.
This design minimized head motion, with less than 100  μm of translation and 0.5 
degrees of rotation over 15 consecutive resting state fMRI runs (at 15 min each) 
across 3 different marmosets. The fMRI data was of sufficient quality to reliably
extract 8 resting state networks from each animal with only 60-90 min of resting 
state fMRI acquisition per animal. The restraint system proved to be an efficient
and practical solution for securing an awake marmoset and positioning a receive
array within minutes, limiting stress to the animal. This design is also amenable
for multimodal imaging, allowing for electrode or lens placement above the skull 
via the open chamber design. All computer-aided-design (CAD) files and
engineering drawings are provided as an open resource, with the majority of the
parts designed to be 3D printed.

Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) was first identified as a potent mitogen for
mature hepatocytes, and has also gained attention as a strong neurotrophic factor
in the central nervous system. We found that during the acute phase of spinal
cord injury (SCI) in rats, c-Met, the specific receptor for HGF, increases
sharply, while the endogenous HGF up-regulation is relatively weak. Introducing
exogenous HGF into the spinal cord by injecting an HGF-expressing viral vector
significantly increased the neuron and oligodendrocyte survival, angiogenesis,
and axonal regeneration, to reduce the area of damage and to promote functional
recovery in rats after SCI. Other recent studies in rodents have shown that
exogenously administered HGF during the acute phase of SCI reduces astrocyte
activation to decrease glial scar formation, and exerts anti-inflammatory effects
to reduce leukocyte infiltration. We also reported that the intrathecal infusion 
of recombinant human HGF (intrathecal rhHGF) improves neurological hand function 
after cervical contusive SCI in the common marmoset, a non-human primate. Based
on these collective results, we conducted a phase I/II clinical trial of
intrathecal rhHGF for patients with acute cervical SCI who showed a modified
Frankel grade of A/B1/B2 72 h after injury onset, from June 2014 to May 2018.

Models of primate sociality focus on the costs and benefits of group living and
how factors such as rank, feeding competition, alliance formation, and
cooperative behavior shape within-group social relationships. We conducted a
series of controlled field experiments designed to investigate how resource
distribution (one or three of four reward platforms) and amount of food on a
reward platform affected foraging strategies and individual feeding success in
four groups of wild common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) living in the Caatinga 
of northeastern Brazil. At our field site, common marmoset groups are
characterized by a single breeding female who can produce twin litters twice per 
year, strong social cohesion, and cooperative infant care provided principally by
several adult male helpers. We found that except for the dominant breeding
female, rank (based on aggression) was not a strong predictor of feeding success.
Although the breeding female in each group occupied the highest rank position and
obtained the greatest daily feeding success, all other group members, including
adults and juveniles experienced relatively equal feeding success across most
experimental conditions. This was accomplished using a balance of behavioral
strategies related to contest competition, scramble competition (associated with 
a finder's advantage), and social tolerance (sharing the same feeding platform). 
Based on these results, the social structure of common marmosets is best
described as "single female dominance," with the breeding female maximizing food 
intake needed to offset the energetic costs associated with reproductive twinning
and the ability to produce two litters per year. Cooperative infant caregiving,
in which the number of helpers is positively correlated with offspring
survivorship, requires a set of behavioral strategies that serve to reduce
contest competition and promote prosocial behaviors at feeding sites.

Chronic lymphocytic enteritis (CLE) is a frequent disease in common marmosets.
However, no diagnostic test for early detection of CLE is available. Mast cells
have an important role in gastrointestinal disease. The purpose of this study was
to measure fecal concentrations of N-methylhistamine (NMH), a breakdown product
of histamine metabolism, in common marmosets. A previously established NMH gas
chromatography-mass spectrometry assay for canine feces and urine was used, and
partial validation was performed. The reference intervals (n = 30) established
for fecal NMH concentrations in common marmoset were 118.2 ng/g or less for a
single fecal sample, 121.7 ng/g or less for the 3-d mean, and less than or equal 
to 167.5 ng/g for the 3-d maximum. Considerable day-to-day variation was observed
in fecal NMH concentrations; the mean %CV was 42.2% (minimum, 7.1%; maximum,
141.4%). Fecal NMH concentrations were measured in 14 marmosets for which
necropsy reports were available; 7 of the 8 marmosets with CLE and the 1 animal
with lymphoma and ulcerative enteritis had increased fecal NMH concentrations.
Increased fecal NMH concentrations may serve as a potential marker for CLE;
however, further studies exploring the role of mast cells in marmosets with CLE
are needed.

Electrocorticography (ECoG) allows the monitoring of electrical field potentials 
from the cerebral cortex with high spatiotemporal resolution. Recent development 
of thin, flexible ECoG electrodes has enabled conduction of stable recordings of 
large-scale cortical activity. We have developed a whole-cortical ECoG array for 
the common marmoset. The array continuously covers almost the entire lateral
surface of cortical hemisphere, from the occipital pole to the temporal and
frontal poles, and it captures whole-cortical neural activity in one shot. This
protocol describes a chronic implantation procedure of the array in the epidural 
space of the marmoset brain. Marmosets have two advantages regarding ECoG
recordings, one being the homologous organization of anatomical structures in
humans and macaques, including frontal, parietal, and temporal complexes. The
other advantage is that the marmoset brain is lissencephalic and contains a large
number of complexes, which are more difficult to access in macaques with ECoG,
that are exposed to the brain surface.These features allow direct access to most 
cortical areas beneath the surface of the brain. This system provides an
opportunity to investigate global cortical information processing with high
resolutions at a sub-millisecond order in time and millimeter order in space.

With rapid aging of the world's population, the demand for research, for a better
understanding of aging and aging-related disorders, is increasing. Ideally, such 
research should be conducted on human subjects. However, due to ethical
considerations, animals such as rodents and monkeys are used as alternatives.
Among these alternative models, non-human primates are preferred because of their
similarities with humans. The small South American common marmoset (Callithrix
jacchus) may offer several advantages over other non-human primates in terms of
its smaller size, shorter life-span, and dental anatomy identical to humans. The 
purpose of this study was to determine the viability of using the marmoset as a
human oral disease model. We collected saliva samples from eight marmosets and
eight human subjects. Prokaryotic DNA was extracted from the saliva samples, and 
16S bacterial rRNA gene sequencing was performed on each of the samples. Our
results indicated that the types of oral microbiomes detected among human and
marmoset samples were nearly indistinguishable. In contrast, the oral microbiomes
of our human and marmoset subjects were distinctly different from those reported 
for rats and dogs, which are currently popular research animals. The oral
microbiomes of marmosets showed greater diversity than those of humans. However, 
the oral microbiota of marmosets exhibited less variation than those of humans,
which may be attributed to the fact that the marmoset subjects were kept in a
controlled environment with identical lifestyles. The characteristics of its oral
microbiota, combined with other technical advantages, suggest that the marmoset
may provide the best animal model thus far for the study of oral health. This
study characterized the oral microbes of the marmoset, thereby providing
information to support future application of the marmoset as a model for
age-related oral disease.

BACKGROUND: Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in the common
marmoset is a nonhuman primate model of multiple sclerosis (MS) that shares
numerous clinical, radiological, and pathological features with MS. Among the
clinical features are motor and sensory deficits that are highly suggestive of
spinal cord (SC) damage.
OBJECTIVE: To characterize the extent and nature of SC damage in symptomatic
marmosets with EAE using a combined magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
histopathology approach.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: SC tissues from five animals were scanned using 7 T MRI to
collect high-resolution ex vivo images. Lesions were segmented and classified
based on shape, size, and distribution along the SC. Tissues were processed for
histopathological characterization (myelin and microglia/macrophages).
Statistical analysis, using linear mixed-effects models, evaluated the
association between MRI and histopathology.
RESULTS: Marmosets with EAE displayed two types of SC lesions: focal and subpial 
lesions. Both lesion types were heterogeneous in size and configuration and
corresponded to areas of marked demyelination with high density of inflammatory
cells. Inside the lesions, the MRI signal was significantly correlated with
myelin content (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings underscore the relevance of this nonhuman primate EAE
model for better understanding mechanisms of MS lesion formation in the SC.

Genome editing technology greatly facilitates the genetic modification of various
cells and animals. The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a small non-human
primate which exhibits high reproductive efficiency, is a widely used animal
model in biomedical research. Developing genome editing techniques in the common 
marmoset will further enhance its utility. Here, we report the successful
establishment of a knock-in (KI) method for marmoset embryonic stem cells (ESCs),
which is based on the CRISPR-Cas9 system. The use of CRISPR-Cas9, mediated by
homologous recombination (HR), enhanced the KI efficiency in marmoset ESCs.
Furthermore, we succeeded in performing KI in early-stage marmoset embryos. In
the course of the experiments, we found that HR in the marmoset ESCs is innately 
highly efficient. This suggested that the marmoset possesses a repair mechanism
for DNA double-strand breaks. The current study will facilitate the generation of
genetically modified marmosets and gene function analysis in the marmoset.

PURPOSE: Ex vivo brains have different MRI properties than in vivo brains because
of chemical changes caused by fixative solutions, which change the signal
intensity and/or tissue contrast on MR images. In this study, we investigated and
compared the MRI properties of in vivo and ex vivo brains.
METHODS: Using a Bruker 9.4T experimental scanner unit for animals (Biospin GmbH,
Ettlingen, Germany), we performed this study on the common marmoset. We measured 
the relaxation and diffusion values in the white matter and cortex of common
marmosets and compared these values between in vivo brains (n = 20) and ex vivo
brains (n = 20). Additionally, we observed the relationship between the tissue
fixation duration and MRI properties by imaging a brain that underwent long-term 
fixation in a preliminary examination (n = 1).
RESULTS: The T1 values of ex vivo brains were decreased compared with those of in
vivo brains; however, there were no significant difference in the T2 and T2*
values of in vivo and ex vivo brains. Axial, radial, and mean diffusivity values 
of ex vivo brains decreased to approximately 65% and 52% of those of in vivo
brains in the cortex and white matter, respectively. Conversely, fractional
anisotropy values were not significantly different between in vivo and ex vivo
brains.
CONCLUSION: The T1 values and diffusion coefficient values of the ex vivo brains 
were strikingly different than those of the in vivo brains. Conversely, there
were no significant changes in the T2, T2* or fractional anisotropy values.
Altogether, the dehydration caused by tissue fixation and the reduction in brain 
temperature were involved in changing the relaxation and diffusion coefficient
values. Here, it was difficult to specify all factors causing these changes.
Further detailed study is needed to examine changes in MRI properties.

Understanding the connectivity architecture of entire vertebrate brains is a
fundamental but difficult task. Here we present an integrated neuro-histological 
pipeline as well as a grid-based tracer injection strategy for systematic
mesoscale connectivity mapping in the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).
Individual brains are sectioned into ~1700 20 µm sections using the tape transfer
technique, permitting high quality 3D reconstruction of a series of histochemical
stains (Nissl, myelin) interleaved with tracer labeled sections. Systematic
in-vivo MRI of the individual animals facilitates injection placement into
reference-atlas defined anatomical compartments. Further, by combining the
resulting 3D volumes, containing informative cytoarchitectonic markers, with
in-vivo and ex-vivo MRI, and using an integrated computational pipeline, we are
able to accurately map individual brains into a common reference atlas despite
the significant individual variation. This approach will facilitate the
systematic assembly of a mesoscale connectivity matrix together with
unprecedented 3D reconstructions of brain-wide projection patterns in a primate
brain.

One of the essential linguistic and musical faculties of humans is the ability to
recognize the structure of sound configurations and to extract words and melodies
from continuous sound sequences. However, monkeys' ability to process the
temporal structure of sounds is controversial. Here, to investigate whether
monkeys can analyze the temporal structure of auditory patterns, two common
marmosets were trained to discriminate auditory patterns in three experiments. In
Experiment 1, the marmosets were able to discriminate trains of either 0.5- or
2-kHz tones repeated in either 50- or 200-ms intervals. However, the marmosets
were not able to discriminate ABAB from AABB patterns consisting of A
(0.5-kHz/50-ms pulse) and B (2-kHz/200-ms pulse) elements in Experiment 2, and A 
(0.5-kHz/50-ms pulse) and B (0.5-kHz/200-ms pulse) [or A (0.5-kHz/200-ms pulse)
and B (2-kHz/200-ms pulse)] in Experiment 3. Consequently, the results indicated 
that the marmosets could not perceive tonal structures in terms of the temporal
configuration of discrete sounds, whereas they could recognize the acoustic
features of the stimuli. The present findings were supported by cognitive and
brain studies that indicated a limited ability to process sound sequences.
However, more studies are needed to confirm the ability of auditory sequence
perception in common marmosets.

Common marmosets are small New World primates that have been increasingly used in
biomedical research. This report presents efficient protocols for assessment of
the parameters of adaptive cell-mediated immunity in common marmosets, including 
the major subpopulations of lymphocytes and main markers of T- and B-cell
maturation and activation using flow cytometry with a multicolor panel of
fluorescently labelled antibodies. Blood samples from eight common marmosets were
stained with fluorescently labeled monoclonal antibodies against their population
markers (CD45, CD3, CD20, CD4, CD8) and lymphocyte maturation and activation
markers (CD69, CD62L, CD45RO, CD107a and CD27) and analyzed by flow cytometry.
Within the CD45+ population, 22.7±5.5% cells were CD3- CD20+ and 67.6±6.3% were
CD3+CD20-. The CD3+ subpopulation included 55.7±5.5% CD3+CD4+CD8- and 34.3±3.7%
CD3+CD4-CD8+ cells. Activation and maturation markers were expressed in the
following lymphocyte proportions: CD62L on 54.0±10.7% of CD3+CD4+ cells and
74.4±12.1% of CD3+CD8+ cells; CD69 on 2.7±1.2% of CD3+CD4+ cells and 1.2±0.5% of 
CD3+CD8+ cells; CD45RO on 1.6±0.6% of CD3+CD4+ cells and 1.8±0.7% of CD3+CD8+
cells; CD107a on 0.7±0.5% of CD3+CD4+ cells and 0.5±0.3% of CD3+CD8+ cells; CD27 
on 94.6±2.1% of CD3+ cells and 8.9±3.9% CD20+ cells. Female and male subjects
differed in the percentage of CD3+CD4+CD45RO+ cells (1.9±0.5 in females vs
1.1±0.2 in males; p < 0.05). The percentage of CD20+CD27+ cells was found to
highly correlate with animals' age (r = 0.923, p < 0.005). The basal parameters
of adaptive cell-mediated immunity in naïve healthy marmosets without markers of 
systemic immune activation were obtained. These parameters and the described
procedures are crucial in documenting the changes induced in common marmosets by 
prophylactic and therapeutic immune interventions.

When offspring share a womb, interactions among fetuses can impart lasting
impressions on phenotypic outcomes. Such intrauterine interactions often are
mediated by sex steroids (estrogens and androgens) produced by the developing
fetuses. In many mammals, intrauterine interactions between brothers and sisters 
lead to masculinization of females, which can induce fitness consequences. Many
litter-bearing primates, though, seem to escape androgen-mediated litter effects,
begging why? Here, we investigated how the sex composition (i.e., same- or
mixed-sex) of litters influences perinatal outcomes in the common marmoset monkey
(Callithrix jacchus), using a combination of physiological, morphological, and
behavioural assays. We hypothesized that androgens from male fetuses would
mediate developmental differences across litter types. We found that newborns
(24-36 hours old) from same- and mixed-sex litters were indistinguishable by
urinary androgen profiles, birth weights, morphometrics, and behaviour. However, 
monkeys born into same- and mixed-sex litters exhibited subtle morphological and 
neurobehavioral differences later in the perinatal period, independent of their
androgen profiles. Our findings suggest that while androgens from male fetuses
likely do not organize their siblings' phenotypes, perinatal stimuli may initiate
divergent developmental trajectories among siblings, which, in turn, promotes
inter-individual variability within families.

Effective antiviral treatments for MERS-CoV are urgently needed. LCA60 is a
MERS-CoV-neutralizing monoclonal antibody isolated from a convalescent MERS
patient. Previously, it was shown that treatment with LCA60 resulted in reduced
disease and virus titers in mouse models of MERS-CoV infection. Here, we tested
the prophylactic efficacy of LCA60 in the common marmoset model of MERS-CoV
infection. Intravenous administration of LCA60 one day before virus challenge
resulted in high levels of MERS-CoV-neutralizing activity in circulating blood.
Clinically, there was a moderate benefit of treatment with LCA60 including
reduced respiratory involvement. Although viral lung loads were not reduced in
LCA60-treated animals as compared to controls, there were fewer pathological
changes in the lungs. Thus, prophylactic LCA60 treatment could be implemented to 
reduce disease burden in contacts of confirmed MERS-CoV patients.

Chitin is a polymer of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc) and a main constituent of 
insects' exoskeleton. Insects are rich in protein with high energy conversion
efficiency. Recently, we have reported that acidic chitinases (Chia) act as
digestive enzymes in mouse, pig and chicken (omnivorous) but not in dog
(carnivorous) and bovine (herbivorous), indicating that feeding behavior affects 
Chia expression levels, and determines chitin digestibility in the particular
animals. Common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) belongs to New World monkey family 
and provides a potential bridge between mouse models and human diseases. Common
marmoset is an insectivorous nonhuman primate with unknown expression levels and 
enzymatic functions of the Chia homologue, CHIA. Here, we report that common
marmoset highly expresses pepsin-, trypsin- and chymotrypsin-resistant CHIA in
the stomach. We show that CHIA is most active at pH 2.0 and degrades chitin and
mealworm shells into GlcNAc dimers under gastrointestinal conditions. Although
common marmoset and crab-eating monkey (Old World monkey) have two CHIA genes in 
their genomes, they primarily express one gene in the stomach. Thus, this study
is the first to investigate expression levels and enzymatic functions of CHIA in 
a New World primate, contributing to the understanding of dietary adaptation and 
digestion in this taxon.

Cognitive control often requires suppression of prepotent stimulus-driven
responses in favor of less potent alternatives. Suppression of prepotent saccades
has been shown to require proactive inhibition in the frontoparietal saccade
network. Electrophysiological evidence in macaque monkeys has revealed neural
correlates of such inhibition in this network; however, the interlaminar
instantiation of inhibitory processes remains poorly understood because these
areas lie deep within sulci in macaques, rendering them inaccessible to laminar
recordings. Here, we addressed this gap by exploiting the mostly lissencephalic
cortex of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). We inserted linear electrode 
arrays into areas 8Ad-the putative marmoset frontal eye field-and the lateral
intraparietal area of two male marmosets and recorded neural activity during
performance of a task comprised of alternating blocks of trials requiring a
saccade either toward a large, high-luminance stimulus or the inhibition of this 
prepotent response in favor of a saccade toward a small, low-luminance stimulus. 
We observed prominent task-dependent activity in both alpha/gamma bands of the
LFP and discharge rates of single neurons in area 8Ad during a prestimulus task
epoch in which the animals had been instructed which of these two tasks to
perform but before peripheral stimulus onset. These data are consistent with a
model in which rhythmic alpha-band activity in deeper layers inhibits spiking in 
upper layers to support proactive inhibitory saccade control.SIGNIFICANCE
STATEMENT Failures to inhibit automatic saccadic responses are a hallmark of many
neuropsychiatric disorders, but how this process is implemented across the
cortical layers in the frontoparietal saccade network remains unknown because
many of the areas are inaccessible to laminar recordings in macaques. Here, we
investigated laminar neural activity in marmoset monkeys, which have a smooth
cortex. Monkeys were required either to generate or inhibit a prepotent saccade
response. In area 8Ad, the putative frontal eye field in marmosets, rhythmic
alpha-band activity (9-14 Hz) was higher in deeper layers and spiking activity
was lower in upper layers when the animals were instructed to suppress a saccade 
toward a peripheral stimulus. Reduced alpha power during task preparation may be 
the underlying common neural basis of a saccade suppression deficit.

Astrocytes are among the most numerous cells in the brain and fulfill diverse
functions in homeostasis and regulation of neuronal activity. Astrocytes also
dramatically change their properties in response to brain injury or disease, a
process called reactive gliosis. Precisely how astrocytes contribute to healthy
brain function and play differential roles in brain pathology and regeneration
remain important areas of investigation. To better understand the properties of
astrocytes, more sophisticated approaches for probing their rich and complex
anatomical and molecular features are needed to fully determine their
contribution to brain physiology. Here we present an efficient and
straightforward immunolabeling protocol to obtain high-resolution
fluorescence-based images from fixed nonhuman primate (common marmoset Callithrix
jacchus) and human brain samples. Importantly, the protocol is useful for
obtaining images from samples that have been stored in fixative solutions (such
as formalin) for years. This approach is especially useful for three-dimensional,
multichannel confocal microscopy and can be optimized for super-resolution
techniques such as stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy. We also
present a strategy for using specific combinations of markers to define the
phenotypic variations and cellular/subcellular properties of astrocytes to better
predict the function of these cells on their surrounding brain microenvironment.

Traditional animal models have been used to make seminal discoveries in
biomedical research including a better understanding of the biology of the aging 
process. However, translation of these findings from laboratory to clinical
populations has likely been hindered due to fundamental biological and
physiological differences between common laboratory animals and humans. Non-human
primates (NHP) may serve as an effective bridge towards translation, and
short-lived NHP like the common marmoset offer many advantages as models for
aging research. Here, we address these advantages and discuss what is currently
understood about the changes in physiology and pathology that occur with age in
the marmoset. In addition, we discuss how aging research might best utilize this 
model resource, and outline an ongoing study to address whether pharmaceutical
intervention can slow aging in the marmoset. With this manuscript, we clarify how
common marmosets might assist researchers in geroscience as a potential model for
pre-clinical translation.

Breast cancer patients using aromatase inhibitors (AIs) as an adjuvant therapy
often report side effects, including hot flashes, mood changes, and cognitive
impairment. Despite long-term use in humans, little is known about the effects of
continuous AI administration on the brain and cognition. We used a primate model 
of human cognitive aging, the common marmoset, to examine the effects of a 4-week
daily administration of the AI letrozole (20 μg, p.o.) on cognition, anxiety,
thermoregulation, brain estrogen content, and hippocampal pyramidal cell
physiology. Letrozole treatment was administered to both male and female
marmosets and reduced peripheral levels of estradiol (E2), but unexpectedly
increased E2 levels in the hippocampus. Spatial working memory and intrinsic
excitability of hippocampal neurons were negatively affected by the treatment
possibly due to increased hippocampal E2. While no changes in hypothalamic E2
were observed, thermoregulation was disrupted by letrozole in females only,
indicating some impact on hypothalamic activity. These findings suggest adverse
effects of AIs on the primate brain and call for new therapies that effectively
prevent breast cancer recurrence while minimizing side effects that further
compromise quality of life.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are 
used as an adjuvant therapy for estrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer and are 
associated with side effects, including hot flashes, depression/anxiety, and
memory deficits severe enough for many women to discontinue this life-saving
treatment. AIs are also used by men, yet sex differences in the reported side
effects have not been systematically studied. We show that AI-treated male and
female marmosets exhibit behavioral changes consistent with these CNS symptoms,
as well as elevated hippocampal estradiol and compromised hippocampal physiology.
These findings illustrate the need for (1) a greater understanding of the precise
mechanisms by which AIs impact brain function and (2) the development of new
treatment approaches for breast cancer patients that minimize adverse effects on 
the brain.

Recently, the common marmoset has been proposed as a non-human primate model of
aging. Their short lifespan coupled with pathologies that are similar to humans
make them an ideal model to understand the genetic, metabolic, and environmental 
factors that influence aging and longevity. However, many of the underlying
physiological changes that occur with age in the marmoset are unknown. Here, we
attempt to determine if individual metabolites are predictive of future death and
to recapitulate past metabolomic results after a change in environment (move
across the country) was imposed on a colony of marmosets. We first determined
that low levels of tryptophan metabolism metabolites were associated with risk of
death in a 2-year follow-up in the animals, suggesting these metabolites may be
used as future biomarkers of mortality. We also discovered that betaine
metabolism and methionine metabolism are associated with aging regardless of
environment for the animals, or of metabolomic assay technique. These two
metabolic pathways are therefore of particular interest to examine as future
targets for health and lifespan extending interventions. Many of the pathways
associated with age in our first study of marmoset metabolomics were not found to
have significant age effects in our second study, suggesting more work is needed 
to understand the reproducibility of large scale metabolomic studies in mammalian
models. Overall, we were able to show that while several metabolomics markers
show promise in understanding health and lifespan relationships with aging, it is
possible that choice of technique for assay and reproducibility in these types of
studies are still issues that need to be examined further.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a small New World primate species
that has been recently targeted as a potentially powerful preclinical model of
human prefrontal cortex dysfunction. Although the structural boundaries of
frontal cortex were described in marmosets at the start of the 20th century
(Brodmann, 1909) and refined more recently (Paxinos et al., 2012), the broad
functional boundaries of marmoset frontal cortex have yet to be established. In
this study, we sought to functionally derive boundaries of the marmoset lateral
frontal cortex (LFC) using ultra-high field (9.4 T) resting-state functional
magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI). We collected RS-fMRI data in seven (four
females, three males) lightly anesthetized marmosets and used a data-driven
hierarchical clustering approach to derive subdivisions of the LFC based on
intrinsic functional connectivity. We then conducted seed-based analyses to
assess the functional connectivity between these clusters and the rest of the
brain. The results demonstrated seven distinct functional clusters within the
LFC. The functional connectivity patterns of these clusters with the rest of the 
brain were also found to be distinct and organized along a rostrocaudal gradient,
consonant with those found in humans and macaques. Overall, these results support
the view that marmosets are a promising preclinical modeling species for studying
LFC dysfunction related to neuropsychiatric or neurodegenerative human brain
diseases.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The common marmoset is a New World primate that
has garnered recent attention as a powerful complement to canonical Old World
primate (e.g., macaques) and rodent models (e.g., rats, mice) for preclinical
modeling of the human brain in healthy and diseased states. A critical step in
the development of marmosets for such models is to characterize functional
network topologies of frontal cortex in healthy, normally functioning marmosets, 
that is, how these circuitries are functionally divided and how those topologies 
compare to human circuitry. To our knowledge, this is the first study to

MD-3 is a novel anti-human ICAM-1 monoclonal antibody that induces T cell
tolerance in humanized mice via modulation of dendritic cell differentiation and 
efficiently suppresses the development of collagen-induced arthritis. This effect
has also been observed in xenograft rejection in nonhuman primates, where grafts 
survived for more than 2.5 years following MD-3 administration. Here, we show
that MD-3 can attenuate experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) that was 
induced in common marmoset monkeys by immunization with human myelin
oligodendrocyte glycoproteins. MD-3 administration was initiated 1 week after
immunization and efficiently delayed the development of EAE phenotypes, although 
the disease was not completely prevented. Based on the results of
histopathological examination, MD-3 treatment greatly suppressed total
inflammation with respect to demyelination, as well as T cell and microglial
infiltration in the brain. However, the antibody response against myelin
oligodendrocyte glycoprotein was not suppressed with this treatment protocol.
These observations suggest that the MD-3 antibody has beneficial effects on the
treatment of EAE via the suppression of T cell-mediated cellular responses.

Animal models that recapitulate the human pathophysiology have been developed as 
useful research tools. Although laboratory mice are widely used, they are
phylogenetically "distant" to humans. New world monkeys, such as the common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) have steadily gained prominence. In this report,
marmosets are explored as an alternate in vivo model to investigate infection and
immunity of Zika virus (ZIKV). Multimodal platforms, including ultrasound and
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), flow cytometry, and multiplex microbead
immunoassays were established to comprehensively decipher immune responses and
pathophysiological outcomes. While ZIKV-infected marmosets had detectable ZIKV
RNA load in various body fluids, animals did not develop any observable lesions
in their testes and brains as shown by ultrasound and MRI. Immune-phenotyping
detected differences in the numbers of B cells, CD8+ T cells and HLADR+ NK cells 
during the first two weeks of infection. Neutralizing ZIKV-specific antibodies
were elicited to high levels and targeted epitopes in the E protein. This study
presents a one-stop-shop platform to study infection and pathophysiology in
marmosets. While marmoset-specific research tools are being refined, the research
values of these animals present them as a good model for immune-based therapies.

Neural activity in the middle temporal (MT) area is modulated by the direction
and speed of motion of visual stimuli. The area is buried in a sulcus in the
macaque, but exposed to the cortical surface in the marmoset, making the marmoset
an ideal animal model for studying MT function. To better understand the details 
of the roles of this area in cognition, underlying anatomical connections need to
be clarified. Because most anatomical tracing studies in marmosets have used
retrograde tracers, the axonal projections remain uncharacterized. In order to
examine axonal projections from MT, we utilized adeno-associated viral (AAV)
tracers, which work as anterograde tracers by expressing either green or red
fluorescent protein in infected neurons. AAV tracers were injected into three
sites in MT based on retinotopy maps obtained via in vivo optical intrinsic
signal imaging. Brains were sectioned and divided into three series, one for
fluorescent image scanning and two for myelin and Nissl substance staining to
identify specific brain areas. Overall projection patterns were similar across
the injections. MT projected to occipital visual areas V1, V2, V3 (VLP) and V4
(VLA) and surrounding areas in the temporal cortex including MTC (V4T), MST, FST,
FSTv (PGa/IPa) and TE3. There were also projections to the dorsal visual pathway,
V3A (DA), V6 (DM) and V6A, the intraparietal areas AIP, LIP, MIP, frontal A4ab
and the prefrontal cortex, A8aV and A8C. There was a visuotopic relationship with
occipital visual areas. In a marmoset in which two tracer injections were made,
the projection targets did not overlap in A8aV and AIP, suggesting topographic
projections from different parts of MT. Most of these areas are known to send
projections back to MT, suggesting that they are reciprocally connected with it.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) has garnered recent attention as a
potentially powerful preclinical model and complement to other canonical
mammalian models of human brain diseases (e.g., rodents and Old World non-human
primates). With a granular frontal cortex and the advent of transgenic
modifications, marmosets are well positioned to serve as neuropsychiatric models 
of prefrontal cortex dysfunction. A critical step in the development of marmosets
for such models is to characterize functional network topologies of frontal
cortex in healthy, normally functioning marmosets. Here, we sought to
characterize the intrinsic functional connectivity of anterior cingulate cortex
(ACC) in marmosets using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging
(RS-fMRI). Seven lightly anesthetized marmosets were imaged at ultra-high field
(9.4 T) and hierarchical clustering was employed to extract functional clusters
of ACC from the RS-fMRI data. The data demonstrated three functionally discrete
clusters within ACC. The functional connectivity between these clusters with the 
rest of the brain was also found to be distinct, supporting the hypothesis that
ACC subregions serve different circuits and their concomitant functions. In a
separate seed-based analysis, we also sought to delineate finer-grained patterns 
of ACC connectivity between marmoset primary motor area 4ab and putative eye
movement areas (8aD and 8aV). This analysis demonstrated distinct patterns of ACC
functional connectivity between motor and eye movement regions that overlapped
well with what has been shown in humans and macaques. Overall, these results
demonstrate that marmosets have a network topology of ACC that resembles that of 
Old World primates, giving further credence to the use of marmosets for
preclinical studies of intractable human brain diseases.

We investigated the viability of a combined repeated dose toxicity study,
including toxicokinetics (TK), in common marmosets according to the ICH-S4,
ICH-S3A and ICH-S7A Guidelines using valsartan as test article whose non-clinical
repeated dose toxicity studies had been conducted using this species for
regulatory purpose. Valsartan was administered orally to 3 animals/sex at 200
mg/kg/day for 2 weeks. In addition to the routine parameters in repeated dose
toxicity studies, safety pharmacology parameters (examinations of the central
nervous, respiratory and cardiovascular systems) were also evaluated. The Plasma 
Micro Sampling Toxicokinetics (PMS-TK) method required ultrasensitive
quantitation, was employed to evaluate the relationship between toxic changes and
plasma concentrations as well as the effects of frequent blood sampling in
individual animals. In valsartan, toxic findings (a deteriorated physical
condition; moribundity of one male and one female on Day 14; sporadic vomitus;
decreases in body weights and food consumption; decreases in erythrocytic
parameters; and renal changes such as an increase in urea nitrogen, dilation of
the tubules and hypertrophy of the tubular epithelium) were similar and plasma
concentrations comparable to the results in the approval information.
Furthermore, no side effects caused by frequent blood sampling were confirmed in 
the negative control group. Consequently, a combined repeated dose toxicity study
including TK analysis using the PMS-TK method is viable in common marmosets and
contributes to animal welfare.

It is well established that human life expectancy increases considerably with an 
ever-growing number of people suffering from age-related cognitive decline and
degenerative brain diseases. This necessitates the development of animal models
to counteract or stop the progression of the decline early enough. Presently,
primate models are few, and many studies argue for the marmoset as an interesting
primate model presenting a short life span and being easily available in research
laboratories. In this article, we propose the marmoset as a valid model for
cognitive decline. Using a computer touch screen, we trained 35 marmosets from 2 
to 14 years of age to perform reversal learning and delayed-matching-to-position 
tasks. We found typical age-related cognitive deficits related to executive
functions and spatial working memory. Applying a recursive algorithm, we detected
2 critical periods from which deficits appear. Mainly, response strategy deficits
appear from age 4, whereas impairments in inhibitory control appear from age 7-8.
Furthermore, the presence of outliers, sometimes at an early age, suggests
pathological cognitive deficits that would require imaging exploration in
parallel to behavior.

INTRODUCTION: The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a small New World monkey,
has been widely used as a biological model in neuroscience to elucidate neural
circuits involved in cognition and to understand brain dysfunction in
neuropsychiatric disorders. In this regard, the availability of gene expression
data derived from next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies represents an
opportunity for a molecular contextualization. Sexual dimorphism account for
differences in diseases prevalence and prognosis. Here, we explore sex
differences on frontal cortex of gene expression in common marmoset's adults.
METHODS: Gene expression profiles in six different tissues (cerebellum, frontal
cortex, liver, heart, and kidney) were analyzed in male and female marmosets. To 
emphasize the translational value of this species for behavioral studies, we
focused on sex-biased gene expression from the frontal cortex of male and female 
in common marmosets and compared to humans (Homo sapiens).
RESULTS: In this study, we found that frontal cortex genes whose expression is
male-biased are conserved between marmosets and humans and enriched with
"house-keeping" functions. On the other hand, female-biased genes are more
related to neural plasticity functions involved in remodeling of synaptic
circuits, stress cascades, and visual behavior. Additionally, we developed and
made available an application-the CajaDB-to provide a friendly interface for
genomic, expression, and alternative splicing data of marmosets together with a
series of functionalities that allow the exploration of these data. CajaDB is
available at cajadb.neuro.ufrn.br.
CONCLUSION: The data point to differences in gene expression of male and female
common marmosets in all tissues analyzed. In frontal cortex, female-biased
expression in synaptic plasticity, stress, and visual processing might be linked 
to biological and behavioral mechanisms of this sex. Due to the limited sample
size, the data here analyzed are for exploratory purposes.

Advances in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computational analysis
technology have enabled comparisons among various primate brains in a
three-dimensional electronic format. Results from comparative studies provide
information about common features across primates and species-specific features
of neuroanatomy. Investigation of various species of non-human primates is
important for understanding such features, but the majority of comparative MRI
studies have been based on experimental primates, such as common marmoset,
macaques, and chimpanzee. A major obstacle has been the lack of a database that
includes non-experimental primates' brain MRIs. To facilitate scientific
discoveries in the field of comparative neuroanatomy and brain evolution, we
launched a collaborative project to develop an open-resource repository of
non-human primate brain images obtained using ex vivo MRI. As an initial open
resource, here we release a collection of structural MRI and diffusion tensor
images obtained from 12 species: pygmy marmoset, owl monkey, white-fronted
capuchin, crab-eating macaque, Japanese macaque, bonnet macaque, toque macaque,
Sykes' monkey, red-tailed monkey, Schmidt's guenon, de Brazza's guenon, and lar
gibbon. Sixteen postmortem brain samples from the 12 species, stored in the Japan
Monkey Centre (JMC), were scanned using a 9.4-T MRI scanner and made available
through the JMC collaborative research program (
http://www.j-monkey.jp/BIR/index_e.html ). The expected significant contributions
of the JMC Primates Brain Imaging Repository include (1) resources for
comparative neuroscience research, (2) preservation of various primate brains,
including those of endangered species, in a permanent digital form, (3) resources
with higher resolution for identifying neuroanatomical features, compared to
previous MRI atlases, (4) resources for optimizing methods of scanning large
fixed brains, and (5) references for veterinary neuroradiology. User-initiated
research projects beyond these contributions are also anticipated.

BACKGROUND: Congenital fused labia (CFL) is defined as a failure or significant
delay in the opening of the juvenile sealed labia majora. This phenotype is known
to be variably common in adult captive female marmosets but has never been
investigated in detail before.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Here, we define, describe and quantify the variations in
the degree of closure of the vulva in 122 captive marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) 
from 1.2 to 42 months old and include colony analysis.
RESULTS: There was a negative correlation between the degree of labial fusion and
animal age after prepubertal period (P < 0.05). CFL females had higher number CFL
relatives (4.3 ± 0.6 vs 2.4 ± 0.5 for non-CFL, P < 0.05) and more external
ancestors compared to non-CFL (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results therefore suggest that CFL phenotype is most likely
associated with epigenetic effects induced by the captive environment and colony 
management strategy of extensive crossing of family lines to promote
heterozygosity.

Chronic diarrhea in laboratory-bred marmosets poses a serious health problem
during experiments. Despite a growing demand for laboratory-bred experimental
marmosets, the mechanisms underlying the development of diarrhea and measures for
its treatment and prevention remain unclear. To explore the factors affecting
development of chronic diarrhea in laboratory-bred marmosets, the gut microbiota 
composition (GMC) of 58 laboratory-bred marmosets, including 19 animals with
chronic diarrhea, was analyzed using terminal restriction fragment length
polymorphism. We found that the GMCs in these animals cluster into two groups
that differ significantly in rate of chronic diarrhea (56.5% in one group,
Cluster 1, and 17.1% in Cluster 2). Additionally, a higher α-diversity and a
lower proportion of Bifidobacterium spp. according to quantitative PCR was found 
the animals in the Cluster 1 than in those in Cluster 2. Taken together, our
findings indicate that there is a relationship between GMC and development of
chronic diarrhea in laboratory-bred marmosets. This is the first study to
highlight the potential of assessing GMC in relation to development of chronic
diarrhea in laboratory-bred marmosets.

BACKGROUND: Pseudotyping of a lentiviral vector with fusion glycoproteins
composed of rabies virus glycoprotein (RVG) and vesicular stomatitis virus
glycoprotein (VSVG) segments achieves high gene transfer efficiency through
retrograde transport in the nervous system. In our previous study, we determined 
the junction of RVG/VSVG segments of glycoproteins that enhances the transduction
efficiency of the neuron-specific retrograde gene transfer (NeuRet) vector
(termed fusion glycoprotein type E or FuG-E).
NEW METHOD: We aimed to optimize the amino acid residue at position 440 in the
membrane-proximal region of FuG-E to improve the efficiency of retrograde gene
transfer in the brain.
RESULTS: We constructed variants of FuG-E with 18 kinds of single amino acid
substitutions at residue 440 to generate lentiviral vectors pseudotyped with
these variants, and tested in vivo gene transfer of the vectors in the mouse
brain. The FuG-E (P440E) variant, in which proline was substituted by glutamate
at residue 440 in FuG-E, showed the greatest retrograde gene transfer efficiency 
in the brain, bearing the property of the NeuRet vector. The FuG-E (P440E)
pseudotype also displayed efficient retrograde gene transfer in the common
marmoset brain.
COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: The NeuRet vector with the FuG-E (P440E)
variant demonstrated higher retrograde gene transfer efficiency into different
neural pathways compared with the parental FuG-E vector.
CONCLUSIONS: The FuG-E (P440E) pseudotype provides a powerful tool to investigate
neural circuit mechanisms underlying various brain functions and for gene therapy
trials of neurological and neurodegenerative diseases.

BACKGROUND: The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is one of the most studied
Neotropical primates regarding reproduction. However, little has been reported on
the black-tufted-ear marmoset (Callithrix penicillata), which may produce fertile
hybrids with other Callithrix. This is the first study to evaluate sperm freezing
from black-tufted-ear marmoset.
METHODS: Testicles from all animals were measured, and semen was collected by
penile vibrostimulation. Samples were analyzed after collection, after chilling
and addition of glycerol, and after thawing.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Fresh semen from both species was similar in many
aspects. Additionally, there is a relationship between total motility, plasma
membrane integrity, and acrosome integrity observed in sperm samples from both
species. We managed to evaluate fresh and thawed sperm with suitable methods for 
use under zoo or field conditions. However, TEST egg yolk with glycerol at 4% and
6% concentration was not effective for sperm protection in both species during
cryopreservation.

With increasing attention on the developmental causes of neuropsychiatric
disorders, appropriate animal models are crucial to identifying causes and
assessing potential interventions. The common marmoset is an ideal model as it
has sophisticated social/emotional behavior, reaching adulthood within 2 years of
birth. Magnetic resonance imaging was used in an accelerated longitudinal cohort 
(n = 41; aged 3-27 months; scanned 2-7 times over 2 years). Splines were used to 
model nonlinear trajectories of grey matter volume development in 53 cortical
areas and 16 subcortical nuclei. Generally, volumes increased before puberty,
peaked, and declined into adulthood. We identified 3 milestones of grey matter
development: I) age at peak volume; II) age at onset of volume decline; and III) 
age at maximum rate of volume decline. These milestones differentiated growth
trajectories of primary sensory/motor cortical areas from those of association
cortex but also revealed distinct trajectories between association cortices.
Cluster analysis of trajectories showed that prefrontal cortex was the most
heterogenous of association regions, comprising areas with distinct milestones
and developmental trajectories. These results highlight the potential of
high-field structural MRI to define the dynamics of primate brain development and
importantly to identify when specific prefrontal circuits may be most vulnerable 
to environmental impact.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is uniquely suited for longitudinal
studies of cognitive aging, due to a relatively short lifespan, sophisticated
cognitive abilities, and patterns of brain aging that resemble those of humans.
We examined cognitive function and fine motor skills in male and female marmosets
(mean age ∼5 at study entry) followed longitudinally for 2 years. Each year,
monkeys were tested on a reversal learning task with three pairs of stimuli
(n = 18, 9 females) and a fine motor task requiring them to grasp small rewards
from two staircases (Hill and Valley test, n = 12, 6 females). There was little
evidence for a decline in cognitive flexibility between the two time points, in
part because of practice effects. However, independent of year of testing,
females took longer than males to reach criterion in the reversals, indicating
impaired cognitive flexibility. Motivation was unlikely to contribute to this
effect, as males refused a greater percentage of trials than females in the
reversals. With regards to motor function, females were significantly faster than
males in the Hill and Valley task. From Year 1 to Year 2, a slight slowing of
motor function was observed in both sexes, but accuracy decreased significantly
in males only. This study (1) demonstrates that marmosets exhibit sex differences
in cognitive flexibility and fine motor function that resemble those described in
humans; (2) that changes in fine motor function can already be detected at
middle-age; and (3) that males may experience greater age-related changes in fine
motor skills than females. Additional data points will determine whether these
sex and age differences persist over time.

BACKGROUND: Common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) are potentially useful nonhuman
primate models for preclinical studies. Information for major drug-metabolizing
cytochrome P450 (P450) enzymes is now available that supports the use of this
primate species as an animal model for drug development. Here, we collect and
provide an overview of information on the activities of common marmoset hepatic
and intestinal microsomes with respect to 28 typical human P450 probe oxidations.
RESULTS: Marmoset P450 2D6/8-dependent R-metoprolol O-demethylation activities in
hepatic microsomes were significantly correlated with those of midazolam 1'- and 
4-hydroxylations, testosterone 6β-hydroxylation, and progesterone
6β-hydroxylation, which are probe reactions for marmoset P450 3A4/5/90. In
marmosets, the oxidation activities of hepatic microsomes and intestinal
microsomes were roughly comparable for midazolam and terfenadine. Overall,
multiple forms of marmoset P450 enzymes in livers and intestines had generally
similar substrate recognition functionalities to those of human and/or cynomolgus
monkey P450 enzymes.
CONCLUSION: The marmoset could be a model animal for humans with respect to the
first-pass extraction of terfenadine and related substrates. These findings
provide a foundation for understanding individual pharmacokinetic and
toxicological results in nonhuman primates as preclinical models and will help to
further support understanding of the molecular mechanisms of human P450 function.

Following a certain type-specific number of mitotic divisions, terminally
differentiated cells undergo proliferative senescence, thwarting efforts to
expand different cell populations in vitro for the needs of scientific research
or medical therapies. The primary cause of this phenomenon is the progressive
shortening of the telomeres and the subsequent activation of cell cycle control
pathways leading to a block of cell proliferation. Restoration of telomere length
by transgenic expression of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) usually
results in bypassing of the replicative senescence and ultimately in cell
immortalization. To date, there have not been any reports regarding
immortalization of cells from common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), an important 
non-human primate model for various human diseases, with the use of exogenous
human TERT (hTERT). In this study, marmoset fibroblasts were successfully
immortalized with transposon-integrated transgenic hTERT and expanded in vitro
for over 500 population doublings. Calculation of population doubling levels
(PDL) showed that the derived hTERT-transgenic lines had significantly higher
proliferation potential than the wild-type fibroblasts, which reached only a
maximum of 46 doublings. However, the immortalized cells exhibited differences in
the morphology compared with the control fibroblasts and transcriptome analysis
also revealed changes in the gene expression patterns. Finally, the karyotypes of
all hTERT-transgenic cell lines showed various aberrations such as presence of
extra Chromosome 17, isochromosome 21q, or tetraploidy. By single-cell expansion 
of the least affected monoclonal immortalized line, one sub-clonal line with
normal karyotype was established, suggesting the possibility to derive immortal
marmoset cells with normal karyotypes. The results of this study are an important
step towards the development and optimization of methods for the production of
immortalized cells from common marmoset monkeys.

Artificial visual stimuli for animal experiments: An experimental evaluation in a
prey capture context with common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus).

Experimenters often use images of real objects to simulate interactions between
animal subjects or visual stimuli on a touchscreen to test animal cognition.
However, the degree to which nonhuman animals recognize 2-D images as
representing the corresponding real objects remains debated. The common marmoset 
monkey (Callithrix jacchus) has been described as a species that spontaneously
shows natural behaviors to 2-D images, for example, grasping behaviors to insects
and fear responses to snakes. In this study, we tested 10 monkeys with their
favorite food item (crickets), 2-D images (a photo and videos of a cricket), and 
a 3-D plastic model to reevaluate marmoset's spontaneous responses to 2-D images 
and to explore which artificial visual stimuli can motivate spontaneous
interactions. The monkeys showed grasping behavior to the real cricket and the
3-D plastic model, but to none of the 2-D images. Our experiment suggests that
depth information is the most important factor eliciting predatory behavior from 
the marmosets, and, therefore, a stimulus produced by a 3-D printer could be a
good alternative when a spontaneous interaction or a convincing stimulus is
required. Furthermore, this work serves as a cautionary tale for those using 2-D 
image presentations with marmosets, and perhaps other animal species. (PsycINFO

BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to develop and analytically validate 
a radioimmunoassay (RIA) for the measurement of alpha1 -proteinase inhibitor (α1 
-PI) concentrations in serum and feces from the common marmoset.
METHODS: Serum samples (n = 30) and 3-day fecal samples (n = 30) were obtained
from healthy marmosets. An RIA was established and validated by determination of 
sensitivity, working range, dilutional parallelism, spiking recovery, and intra- 
and interassay variability. A reference interval for mα1 -PI in serum and feces
was established.
RESULTS: Sensitivity and upper limit of the working range were 0.75 and
100.62 μg/L, respectively. Observed-to-expected (O/E) ratios for serial dilutions
ranged from 89.9% to 123.0% (mean ±SD: 106.0 ± 11.5%) for 8 serum samples, and
from 90.6% to 132.7% (mean ±SD: 107.6 ± 19.2%) for 4 fecal samples. O/E ratios
for spiking recovery ranged from 97.6% to 104.4% (mean ±SD: 101.3 ± 3%) for 4
serum samples, and from 97.5% to 101.4% (mean ±SD: 99.2 ± 1.8%) for 4 fecal
samples and 3 different spiking concentrations. Coefficients of variation (CV)
for intra-assay variability for 8 serum samples ranged from 1.7% to 10.6% and
2.2% to 5.1% in the 8 fecal samples. The interassay CV for eight serum samples
ranged from 1.3% to 9.9%, and from 1.0% to 6.7% in the 8 fecal samples. The
reference interval in serum was determined to be 1047-1484 μg/L. The reference
interval in serum was determined to be 1047-1484 μg/L. The reference interval for
the 3-day mean fecal concentration, and 3-day maximum fecal concentration were
determined to be 32.4-124.4 μg/g and 39.1-158.7 μg/g of feces, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The developed assay is sensitive, linear, accurate, precise, and
reproducible. Further studies are needed to determine the clinical utility of
this assay.

To understand brain circuits of cognitive behaviors under natural conditions, we 
developed techniques for imaging neuronal activities from large neuronal
populations in the deep layer cortex of the naturally behaving common marmoset.
Animals retrieved food pellets or climbed ladders as a miniature fluorescence
microscope monitored hundreds of calcium indicator-expressing cortical neurons in
the right primary motor cortex. This technique, which can be adapted to other
brain regions, can deepen our understanding of brain circuits by facilitating
longitudinal population analyses of neuronal representation associated with
cognitive naturalistic behaviors and their pathophysiological processes.

Estrogen depletion leads to bone loss in almost all mammals with frequent regular
ovarian cycles. However, subordinate adult female common marmosets (Callithrix
jacchus) undergo socially induced anovulation and hypoestrogenism without
clinically apparent adverse skeletal consequences. Thus, we speculated that this 
non human primate might have evolved a mechanism to avoid estrogen-depletion bone
loss. To test this possibility, we performed three experiments in which
lumbar-spine (L5-L6) bone mineral content (BMC) and density (BMD) were assessed
using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry: (i) cross-sectionally in 13 long-term
ovariectomized animals and 12 age- and weight-matched controls undergoing
ovulatory cycles; (ii) longitudinally in 12 animals prior to, 3-4 and 6-7 months 
following ovariectomy (ovx), and six controls; and (iii) cross-sectionally in
nine anovulatory subordinate and nine dominant females. In Experiments 1 and 3,
plasma estradiol and estrone concentrations were measured and uterine dimensions 
were obtained by ultrasound in a subset of animals as a marker of functional
estrogen depletion. Estrogen levels, uterine trans-fundus width, and uterine
dorso-ventral diameter were lower in ovariectomized and subordinate females than 
in those undergoing ovulatory cycles. However, no differences were found in L5-L6
BMC or BMD. These results indicate that estrogen depletion, whether surgically or
socially induced, is not associated with lower bone mass in female common
marmosets. Thus, this species may possess unique adaptations to avoid bone loss
associated with estrogen depletion.

Rodent laboratory animals, such as mice and rats have been greatly contributing
to biomedical research. Although its usefulness would not change in the future,
nonhuman primates (NHPs) also offer excellent models for preclinical research to 
assess safety and efficacy of developing novel therapeutic approaches because of 
their similarities of genetics, metabolism and physiological characteristics to
humans. Recent years, the gene modification technology in nonhuman primates has
been developed. In fact, pre-clinical studies using nonhuman primates are
increasing in the world, especially in the neuroscience research field. Among the
NHPs, the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is one of a suitable NHP
laboratory animal for producing genetically modified models because they are
fecund animal. This article outlines the common marmoset and that of the disease 
models.

cells has been demonstrated in the human pituitary. However, considering the
difficulty in fully examining the stem/progenitor cell properties in the human
pituitary, in the present study, we analyzed the SOX2-positive cells in the
pituitary of the adult common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), which is used as a
non-human primate model. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that localization
pattern of SOX2-positive cells in the common marmoset pituitary was similar to
that observed in the rodent pituitary, i.e., in the two types of niches (marginal
cell layer and parenchymal-niche) and as scattered single cells in the parenchyma
of the anterior lobe. Furthermore, most of the SOX2-positive cells express S100
and were located in the center or interior of LAMININ-positive micro-lobular
structures. Collectively, the present study reveals properties of SOX2-positive
cells in the common marmoset pituitary and suggests that the common marmoset
proves to be a useful tool for analyzing pituitary stem/progenitor cells in a
non-human primate model.

A 6-y-old, intact, pair-housed male common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus)
presented with acute onset dyspnea and tachypnea immediately after sedation with 
alfaxalone; a history of gradual weight loss initiated the examination under
sedation. Thoracic radiographs revealed significant right-lung consolidation,
with a vesicular gas pattern in the right caudodorsal lung field, pleural
effusion, and dorsal displacement of the heart. The marmoset was euthanized due
to his unstable condition and poor prognosis. At necropsy, the cranial and middle
lobes of the right lung were homogenously dark red-brown, enlarged, edematous,
and twisted around the longitudinal axis at the hilus. The left lung lobes were
pale pink and slightly edematous. In light of the clinical and gross necropsy
findings, acute torsion of the right cranial and middle lung lobes was diagnosed.
Predisposing conditions for lung lobe torsion include trauma, neoplasia,
pulmonary disease, previous thoracic surgery, and diaphragmatic hernia, but none 
of these applied to this case. Initial therapy for lung lobe torsion is to
stabilize the patient and treat for underlying conditions, with prompt surgical
resection as the treatment of choice. To our knowledge, this report is the first 
description of lung lobe torsion in an experimentally unmanipulated New World
NHP.

We studied personality, subjective well-being, and hair cortisol level, in common
marmosets Callithrix jacchus, a small, cooperatively breeding New World monkey,
by examining their associations with one another and genotypes. Subjects were 68 
males and 9 females that lived in the RIKEN Center for Life Science Technologies.
Personality and subjective well-being were assessed by keeper ratings on two
questionnaires, hair samples were obtained to assay cortisol level and buccal
swabs were used to assess AVPR1a, OPRM1 and DAT genotypes. Three personality
domains-Dominance, Sociability, and Neuroticism-were identified. Consistent with 
findings in other species, Sociability and Neuroticism were related to higher and
lower subjective well-being, respectively. Sociability was also associated with
higher hair cortisol levels. The personality domains and hair cortisol levels
were heritable and associated with genotypes: the short form of AVPR1a was
associated with lower Neuroticism and the AA genotype of the A111T SNP of OPRM1
was related to lower Dominance, lower Neuroticism, and higher hair cortisol
level. Some genetic associations were not in directions that one would expect
given findings in other species. These findings provide insights into the
proximate and ultimate bases of personality in common marmosets, other primates
and humans.

Drugs modulating the metabotropic glutamate type 2 receptor (mGluR2) activity may
have therapeutic benefits in treating a large spectrum of neuro-psychiatric
disorders, from schizophrenia to Parkinson's disease, both as a symptomatic
therapy and potential disease-modifying paradigm. LY-487,379 is a highly
selective mGluR2 positive allosteric modulator that is widely used to study
mGluR2 function using experimental animal models. The common marmoset is a small 
primate that has long been used in neuroscience. However, given its small size
and small circulating blood volume, conducting studies to determine the PK
profile of LY-487,379 is challenging. We developed and validated a sensitive and 
selective analytical method that enables quantification of LY-487,379 using a
limited volume of plasma (10 μL). The analytical method consists of protein
precipitation followed by high-performance liquid chromatography with heat
assisted electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HPLC-HESI-MS/MS). The
chromatographic separation was achieved using gradient elution with a mobile
phase consisting of acetonitrile and 0.01% formic acid in water on a Thermo
Scientific Aquasil C18 analytical column (100 × 2.1 mm I.D., 5 μm) operating at
40 °C and at a flow rate of 300 μL/min. The method displays a linear relationship
ranging from 0.2 to 100 ng/mL. Intra- and inter-day relative standard deviations 
are <1.4% and 7.9%, respectively and the relative error ranged from -6.9 to 9.7%.
The method was used to quantify LY-487,379 in both rat and marmoset plasma, and
PK parameters were determined after a single subcutaneous dose of 1.0 mg kg-1 in 
both species and significant differences in Cmax, AUC and T1/2 were observed.

Blockade of serotonin 2A (5-HT2A) receptors is regarded as an anti-dyskinetic and
anti-psychotic strategy in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the 5-HT2A
antagonists tested so far exhibited affinity for other receptors, which might
have played a role in their action. EMD-281,014 is the most selective 5-HT2A
antagonist available, with approximately 2,000-fold selectivity over serotonin 2C
(5-HT2C) receptors. EMD-281,014 was previously tested in the clinic and has high 
translational potential. In the present study, we assessed the effect of
EMD-281,014 on dyskinesia and psychosis in the
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-lesioned common marmoset. We 
first determined the pharmacokinetic profile of EMD-281,014 in the marmoset,
after which doses leading to clinically-relevant plasma levels (0.01, 0.03 and
0.1 mg/kg) or vehicle were administered to MPTP-lesioned marmosets, in
combination with L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA). The effects of
EMD-281,014 on dyskinesia, psychosis-like behaviours (PLBs) and parkinsonism were
then evaluated. When added to l-DOPA, EMD-281,014 (0.03 and 0.1 mg/kg) reduced
peak dose dyskinesia, by 41.8% and 54.5% (P < 0.05 and P < 0.001), when compared 
to l-DOPA/vehicle. EMD-281,014 (0.03 and 0.1 mg/kg) also significantly reduced
the severity of peak dose PLBs, by 42.5% and 45.9% (P < 0.05 and P < 0.001), when
compared to vehicle. The anti-dyskinetic and anti-psychotic effects of
EMD-281,014 were achieved without interfering with l-DOPA anti-parkinsonian
action. Our results suggest that highly-selective 5-HT2A receptor blockade with
EMD-281,014 is an effective way to alleviate both dyskinesia and psychosis in PD,
without adversely affecting parkinsonian disability.

Bifidobacterium is a diverse genus of anaerobic, saccharolytic bacteria that
colonize many animals, notably humans and other mammals. The presence of these
bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract represents a potential coevolution between
the gut microbiome and its mammalian host mediated by diet. To study the
relationship between bifidobacterial gut symbionts and host nutrition, we
analyzed the genome of two bifidobacteria strains isolated from the feces of a
common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a primate species studied for its ability
to subsist on host-indigestible carbohydrates. Whole genome sequencing identified
these isolates as unique strains of Bifidobacterium callitrichos. All three
strains, including these isolates and the previously described type strain,
contain genes that may enable utilization of marmoset dietary substrates. These
include genes predicted to contribute to galactose, arabinose, and trehalose
metabolic pathways. In addition, significant genomic differences between strains 
suggest that bifidobacteria possess distinct roles in carbohydrate metabolism
within the same host. Thus, bifidobacteria utilize dietary components specific to
their host, both humans and non-human primates alike. Comparative genomics
suggests conservation of possible coevolutionary relationships within the primate
clade.

The high case-fatality rate of confirmed MERS-CoV infections underlines the
urgent need for an effective treatment to reduce the disease severity and
mortality. REGN3051 and REGN3048 are two fully human neutralizing monoclonal
antibodies (mAb) against MERS-CoV that reduced virus replication in mice
expressing human DPP4 upon prophylactic and therapeutic treatment. Here, we
evaluated the prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of REGN3048 and REGN3051 in
the common marmoset model of MERS-CoV infection. Intravenous administration of
mAb resulted in high levels of MERS-CoV-neutralizing activity in circulating
blood. When animals were treated with mAbs one day before challenge, respiratory 
disease was less severe and, in animals treated with both REGN3048 and REGN3051, 
viral loads in the lungs were reduced. However, therapeutic treatment on day one 
after challenge was less efficacious as it did not prevent the development of
severe respiratory disease and all treated animals developed bronchointerstitial 
pneumonia of similar severity as the control animals. Thus, mAb administration
may be more effective in a prophylactic treatment regimen rather than treatment
of MERS.

STUDY QUESTION: Are monkey testicular peritubular cells (MKTPCs) from the common 
marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus) a suitable translational model for the study
of human testicular peritubular cells (HTPCs)?
SUMMARY ANSWER: MKTPCs can be isolated and propagated in vitro, retain
characteristic markers for testicular peritubular cells and their proteome
strongly (correlation coefficient of 0.78) overlaps with the proteome of HTPCs.
WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Smooth-muscle-like peritubular cells form the wall of
seminiferous tubules, transport sperm, are immunologically active, secrete a
plethora of factors and may contribute to the spermatogonial stem cell niche.
Mechanistic studies are hampered by heterogeneity of human samples.
STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: We established a culture method for MKTPCs and
characterized these cells from six young adult animals (2-3 years). To examine
whether they qualify as a translational model we also examined HTPCs from seven
men and compared the proteomes of both groups.
PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: We used explant cultures to obtain
MKTPCs, which express smooth muscle markers (calponin (CNN1), smooth muscle actin
(ACTA2)), lack FSH-receptors (FSHR) and LH-receptors (LHCGR), but possess
androgen receptors (AR). MKTPCs can be passaged at least up to eight times,
without discernable phenotypic changes. Mass-spectrometry-based analyses of the
MKTPC and HTPC proteomes were performed.
MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: We established a method for isolation and
cultivation of MKTPCs, and provide a comprehensive analysis of their protein
repertoire. The results let us conclude that MKTPCs are suitable as a non-human
primate model to study peritubular cell functions.
LARGE SCALE DATA: List of identified proteins in MKTPCs by liquid
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry is accessible at the ProteomeXchange
(identifier PXD009394).
LIMITATIONS, REASON FOR CAUTION: This is an in vitro cellular non-human primate
model used to provide a window into the role of these cells in the human testis.
WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Previous studies with HTPCs from patients
revealed a degree of heterogeneity, possibly due to age, lifestyle and medical
history of the individual human donors. We anticipate that the new translational 
model, derived from young healthy non-human primates, may allow us to circumvent 
these issues and may lead to a better understanding of the role of peritubular
cells.

Common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is emerging as a clinically relevant
nonhuman primate model for various diseases, but is hindered by the availability 
of marmoset cell lines, which are critical for understanding the disease
pathogenesis and drug/toxicological screening prior to animal testing. Here we
describe the generation of immortalized marmoset hepatic progenitor cells (MHPCs)
by lentivirus-mediated transfer of the simian virus 40 large T antigen gene in
fetal liver polygonal cells. MHPCs proliferate indefinitely in vitro without
chromosomal alteration and telomere shortening. These cells possess hepatic
progenitor cell-specific gene expression profiles with potential to differentiate
into both hepatocytic and cholangiocytic lineages in vitro and in vivo and also
can be genetically modified. Importantly, injected MHPCs repopulated the injured 
liver of fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (Fah)-deficient mice with hepatocyte-like 
cells. MHPCs also engraft as cholangiocytes into bile ducts of
3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine (DDC)-induced bile ductular injured
mice. MHPCs provide a tool to enable efficient derivation and genetic
modification of both hepatocytes and cholangiocytes for use in disease modeling, 
tissue engineering, and drug screening.

Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is an important mosquito-borne veterinary and
human pathogen that has caused large outbreaks of severe disease throughout
Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. Currently, no licensed vaccine or therapeutics 
exists to treat this potentially deadly disease. The explosive nature of RVFV
outbreaks and the severe consequences of its accidental or intentional
introduction into RVFV-free areas provide the impetus for the development of
novel vaccine candidates for use in both livestock and humans. Rationally
designed vaccine candidates using reverse genetics have been used to develop
deletion mutants of two known RVFV virulence factors, the NSs and NSm genes.
These recombinant viruses were demonstrated to be protective and immunogenic in
rats, mice, and sheep, without producing clinical illness in these animals. Here,
we expand upon those findings and evaluate the single deletion mutant (ΔNSs
rRVFV) and double deletion mutant (ΔNSs-ΔNSm rRVFV) vaccine candidates in the
common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a non-human primate (NHP) model resembling 
severe human RVF disease. We demonstrate that both the ΔNSs and ΔNSs-ΔNSm rRVFV
vaccine candidates were found to be safe and immunogenic in the current study.
The vaccinated animals received a single dose of vaccine that led to the
development of a robust antibody response. No vaccine-induced adverse reactions, 
signs of clinical illness or infectious virus were detected in the vaccinated
marmosets. All vaccinated animals that were subsequently challenged with RVFV
were protected against viremia and liver disease. In summary, our results provide
the basis for further development of the ΔNSs and ΔNSs-ΔNSm rRVFV as safe and
effective human RVFV vaccines for this significant public health threat.

Natural sound is composed of various frequencies. Although the core region of the
primate auditory cortex has functionally defined sound frequency preference maps,
how the map is organized in the auditory areas of the belt and parabelt regions
is not well known. In this study, we investigated the functional organizations of
the core, belt, and parabelt regions encompassed by the lateral sulcus and the
superior temporal sulcus in the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). Using
optical intrinsic signal imaging, we obtained evoked responses to band-pass noise
stimuli in a range of sound frequencies (0.5-16 kHz) in anesthetized adult
animals and visualized the preferred sound frequency map on the cortical surface.
We characterized the functionally defined organization using histologically
defined brain areas in the same animals. We found tonotopic representation of a
set of sound frequencies (low to high) within the primary (A1), rostral (R), and 
rostrotemporal (RT) areas of the core region. In the belt region, the tonotopic
representation existed only in the mediolateral (ML) area. This representation
was symmetric with that found in A1 along the border between areas A1 and ML. The
functional structure was not very clear in the anterolateral (AL) area. Low
frequencies were mainly preferred in the rostrotemplatal (RTL) area, while high
frequencies were preferred in the caudolateral (CL) area. There was a portion of 
the parabelt region that strongly responded to higher sound frequencies (>5.8
kHz) along the border between the rostral parabelt (RPB) and caudal parabelt
(CPB) regions.

Cooperatively breeding common marmosets raise their infants with the help of
other adult group members, but individual care-taking contribution can vary
considerably. We tested four hypotheses that may explain this variation within
marmoset family groups. The pay-for-help hypothesis argues that allogrooming is
used strategically by parents to pay helpers for helping. The
pay-for-infant-access hypothesis claims that helpers use allogrooming as payment 
for infant-access. The intrinsic predisposition hypothesis suggests that more
affiliative individuals are also more motivated for infant-care, and the
relationship quality hypothesis that individuals involved in highly affiliative
relationships with main caregivers contribute more to infant-care. To test these 
hypotheses, we followed five marmoset family groups over a total of eight
reproductive cycles, and quantified affiliative behavior, infant-carrying, and
food sharing over six to 12 weeks around infant-birth. We found no evidence for
either the pay-for-help or pay-for-infant-access hypotheses nor did intrinsic
prosocial predisposition determine individual infant-care. Mutual dyadic
affiliation, however, was positively linked to infant-carrying and food sharing
in female and male breeders and in male helpers. This suggests that cooperation
during infant-care is mediated by relationship quality rather than strategic
grooming in marmosets. Overall, these results may also contribute to a better
understanding of cooperation in humans.

During its most recent outbreak across the Americas, Zika virus (ZIKV) was
surprisingly shown to cause fetal loss and congenital malformations in acutely
and chronically infected pregnant women. However, understanding the underlying
pathogenesis of ZIKV congenital disease has been hampered by a lack of relevant
in vivo experimental models. Here we present a candidate New World monkey model
of ZIKV infection in pregnant marmosets that faithfully recapitulates human
disease. ZIKV inoculation at the human-equivalent of early gestation caused an
asymptomatic seroconversion, induction of type I/II interferon-associated genes
and proinflammatory cytokines, and persistent viremia and viruria. Spontaneous
pregnancy loss was observed 16-18 days post-infection, with extensive active
placental viral replication and fetal neurocellular disorganization similar to
that seen in humans. These findings underscore the key role of the placenta as a 
conduit for fetal infection, and demonstrate the utility of marmosets as a highly
relevant model for studying congenital ZIKV disease and pregnancy loss.

Corepresentation During Joint Action in Marmoset Monkeys ( Callithrix jacchus).

Miss FM(1), Burkart JM(1).

Behavioral coordination is a fundamental element of human cooperation. It is
facilitated when individuals represent not only their own actions but also those 
of their partner. Identifying whether action corepresentation is unique to humans
or also present in other species is therefore necessary to fully understand the
evolution of human cooperation. We used the auditory joint Simon task to assess
whether action corepresentation occurs in common marmosets, a monkey species that
engages extensively in coordinated action during cooperative infant care. We
found that marmosets indeed show a joint Simon effect. Furthermore, when
coordinating their behavior in the joint task, they were more likely to look at
their partner than in a joint control condition. Corepresentation is thus not
unique to humans but also present in the cooperatively breeding marmosets. Since 
marmosets are small-brained monkeys, our results suggest that routine
coordination in space and time, rather than complex cognitive abilities, plays a 
role in the evolution of corepresentation.

Multiple sclerosis is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central
nervous system. Although it has been extensively studied, the proximate trigger
of the immune response remains uncertain. Experimental autoimmune
encephalomyelitis in the common marmoset recapitulates many radiological and
pathological features of focal multiple sclerosis lesions in the cerebral white
matter, unlike traditional experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in rodents. 
This provides an opportunity to investigate how lesions form as well as the
relative timing of factors involved in lesion pathogenesis, especially during
early stages of the disease. We used MRI to track experimental autoimmune
encephalomyelitis lesions in vivo to determine their age, stage of development,
and location, and we assessed the corresponding histopathology post-mortem. We
focused on the plasma protein fibrinogen-a marker for blood-brain barrier leakage
that has also been linked to a pathogenic role in inflammatory demyelinating
lesion development. We show that fibrinogen has a specific spatiotemporal
deposition pattern, apparently deriving from the central vein in early
experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis lesions <6 weeks old, and preceding
both demyelination and visible gadolinium enhancement on MRI. Thus, fibrinogen
leakage is one of the earliest detectable events in lesion pathogenesis. In
slightly older lesions, fibrinogen is found inside microglia/macrophages,
suggesting rapid phagocytosis. Quantification demonstrates positive correlation
of fibrinogen deposition with accumulation of inflammatory cells, including
microglia/macrophages and T cells. The peak of fibrinogen deposition coincides
with the onset of demyelination and axonal loss. In samples from chronic multiple
sclerosis cases, fibrinogen was found at the edge of chronic active lesions,
which have ongoing demyelination and inflammation, but not in inactive lesions,
suggesting that fibrinogen may play a role in sustained inflammation even in the 
chronic setting. In summary, our data support the notion that fibrinogen is a key
player in the early pathogenesis, as well as sustained inflammation, of
inflammatory demyelinating lesions.

Spermatogonial behavior in marmoset: a new generation, their kinetics and niche.

STUDY QUESTION: Could a more detailed evaluation of marmoset spermatogonial
morphology, kinetics and niches using high-resolution light microscopy (HRLM)
lead to new findings?
SUMMARY ANSWER: Three subtypes of marmoset undifferentiated spermatogonia, which 
were not evenly distributed in terms of number and position along the basal
membrane, and an extra premeiotic cell division not present in humans were
identified using HRLM.
WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: The seminiferous epithelium cycle (SEC) of marmosets is
divided into nine stages when based on the acrosome system, and several
spermatogenic stages can usually be recognized within the same tubular
cross-section. Three spermatogonial generations have been previously described in
marmosets: types Adark, Apale and B spermatogonia.
STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Testes from five adult Callithrix penicillata were 
fixed by glutaraldehyde perfusion via the cardiac route and embedded in Araldite 
plastic resin for HRLM evaluation. Semi-thin sections (1 μm) were analyzed
morphologically and morphometrically to evaluate spermatogonial morphology and
kinetics (number, mitosis and apoptosis), spermatogenesis efficiency and the
spermatogonial niche.
PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Shape and nuclear diameter, the
presence and distribution of heterochromatin, the granularity of the euchromatin,
as well as the number, morphology and degree of nucleolar compaction were
observed for morphological characterization. Kinetics analyses were performed for
all spermatogonial subtypes and preleptotene spermatocytes, and their mitosis and
apoptosis indexes determined across all SEC stages. Spermatogenesis parameters
(mitotic, meiotic, Sertoli cell workload and general spermatogenesis efficiency) 
were determined through the counting of Adark and Apale spermatogonia,
preleptotene and pachytene primary spermatocytes, round spermatids, and Sertoli
cells at stage IV of the SEC.
MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: This is the first time that a study in
marmosets demonstrates: the existence of a new spermatogonial generation (B2);
the presence of two subtypes of Adark spermatogonia with (AdVac) and without
(AdNoVac) nuclear rarefaction zones; the peculiar behavior of AdVac spermatogonia
across the stages of the SEC, suggesting that they are quiescent stem
spermatogonia; and that AdVac spermatogonia are located close to areas in which
blood vessels, Leydig cells and macrophages are concentrated, suggesting a niche 
area for these cells.
LARGE SCALE DATA: Not applicable.
LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The C. penicillata spermatogonial kinetics
evaluated here consider spermatogonial number across the SEC and their mitotic
and apoptotic figures identified in HRLM sections. Therefore, caution is required
when comparing absolute values between species. Although morphometric evaluation 
has suggested that AdVac spermatogonia are stem cells, a functional proof of this
is still missing. It is known that parameters of the spermatogenic process in C. 
penicillata have similarities with those of the common marmoset C. jacchus,
however, a detailed study of spermatogonial morphology, kinetics and niche has
not yet been performed in C. jacchus, and a full comparison of the two species is
not possible.
WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Our findings in C. penicillata contribute to 
a better understanding of the spermatogonial behavior and spermatogenesis
efficiency in non-human primates. Given the phylogenetic closeness of the
marmoset to the human species, similar processes might occur in humans.
Therefore, marmosets may be an excellent model for studies regarding human
testicular biology, fertility and related disorders.

Common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) are potentially useful nonhuman primate
models for preclinical studies. An anti-inflammatory drug, diclofenac is
reportedly metabolized mainly by human cytochrome P450 (P450) 2C9 to
4'-hydroxydiclofenac and minorly by P450 3A4 to 5-hydroxydiclofenac that leads to
reactive intermediates. In this study, in vivo pharmacokinetics in six marmosets 
and in vitro metabolism in nine marmoset liver microsomes were analyzed using
diclofenac to evaluate marmosets as preclinical drug metabolism models. In
wild-type marmosets genotyped for P450 2C19 p.[(Phe7Leu; Ser254Leu; Ile469Thr)], 
plasma levels of 5-hydroxydiclofenac and 4'-hydroxydiclofenac were roughly
similar, but the homozygotes showed approximately three-times higher plasma
levels of 5-hydroxydiclofenac than those of 4'-hydroxydiclofenac after oral
administrations of diclofenac (50 mg/kg). Nine marmoset liver microsomes
catalyzed mainly diclofenac 5-hydroxylation with no significant effects of the
the P450 2C19 genotype, and partly diclofenac 4'-hydroxylation that depended on
the P450 2C19 genotype, at substrate concentrations of 10 µM and 100 µM. Both
Michaels-Menten constant Km values for diclofenac 4'-hydroxylation in human and
marmoset liver microsomes were ∼30 μM and those for diclofenac 5-hydroxylation
were ∼120 μM. Ketoconazole significantly suppressed only diclofenac
5-hydroxylation in marmoset or human liver microsomes at 0.030 μM, indicating
main contribution of P450 3A enzymes, which were found to be P450 3A5/90 using
recombinant marmoset P450 3A enzymes. These results suggest that marmosets would 
be a functional animal model for in vivo and in vitro metabolites likely
generated via arene oxide intermediates of diclofenac by P450 3A enzymes in
humans, primarily because marmosets lack the ortholog of human P450 2C9.

Learning and memory processes are similarly organized in humans and monkeys;
therefore, monkeys can be ideal models for analyzing human aging processes and
neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. With the development of
novel gene modification methods, common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) have been 
suggested as an animal model for neurodegenerative diseases. Furthermore, the
common marmoset's lifespan is relatively short, which makes it a practical animal
model for aging. Working memory deficits are a prominent symptom of both dementia
and aging, but no data are currently available for visual working memory in
common marmosets. The delayed matching-to-sample task is a powerful tool for
evaluating visual working memory in humans and monkeys; therefore, we developed a
novel procedure for training common marmosets in such a task. Using visual
discrimination and reversal tasks to direct the marmosets' attention to the
physical properties of visual stimuli, we successfully trained 11 out of 13
marmosets in the initial stage of the delayed matching-to-sample task and
provided the first available data on visual working memory in common marmosets.
We found that the marmosets required many trials to initially learn the task
(median: 1316 trials), but once the task was learned, the animals needed fewer
trials to learn the task with novel stimuli (476 trials or fewer, with the
exception of one marmoset). The marmosets could retain visual information for up 
to 16 s. Our novel training procedure could enable us to use the common marmoset 
as a useful non-human primate model for studying visual working memory deficits
in neurodegenerative diseases and aging.

BACKGROUND: A vaccine against all four dengue virus (DENV) serotypes includes the
formulation of one genotype of each serotype. Although genetic similarities among
genotypes within a serotype are higher as compared to those among serotypes,
differences in the immunogenicity of the included genotypes would be a critical
issue in maximizing successful dengue vaccine development. Thus, we determined
the neutralizing antibody responses against three genotypes of dengue virus
serotype 2 (DENV-2), namely Cosmopolitan, Asian I, and Asian/American, after
primary and secondary inoculation with DENV-2 in a dengue animal model, the
common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).
METHODS: A total of fifty-four plasma samples were obtained from thirty-four
marmosets that were inoculated with clinically-isolated DENV strains or DENV
candidate vaccines, were used in this study. Plasma samples were obtained from
marmosets after primary inoculation with DENV-2 infection, secondary inoculation 
with homologous or heterologous genotypes, and tertiary inoculation with
heterologous DENV. Neutralizing antibody titers against DENV-2 (Cosmopolitan,
Asian I, and Asian/American genotypes) and DENV-1 were determined using a
conventional plaque reduction neutralization assay.
RESULTS: In marmosets that were inoculated with the Cosmopolitan genotype in
primary infection, neutralizing antibody neutralized 3 genotypes, and the titers 
to Asian I genotype were significantly higher than those to homologous
Cosmopolitan genotype. After secondary DENV-2 infection with heterologous
genotype (Asian I in primary and Asian/American in secondary), neutralizing
antibody titers to Asian/American genotype was significantly higher than those
against Cosmopolitan and Asian I genotypes. Following tertiary infection with
DENV-1 following DENV-2 Asian I and Cosmopolitan genotypes, neutralizing antibody
titers to Asian/American were also significantly higher than those against
Cosmopolitan and Asian I genotypes.
CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrated that different levels of neutralizing 
antibodies were induced against variable DENV-2 genotypes after primary,
secondary and tertiary infections, and that neutralizing antibody titers to some 
heterologous genotypes were higher than those to homologous genotypes within a
serotype. The results indicate that heterogeneity and homogeneity of infecting
genotypes influence the levels and cross-reactivity of neutralizing antibodies
induced in following infections. The results also suggest that certain genotypes 
may possess advantage in terms of breakthrough infections against vaccination.

Hearing research has long been facilitated by rodent models, although in some
diseases, human symptoms cannot be recapitulated. The common marmoset (Callithrix
jacchus) is a small, easy-to-handle New World monkey which has a similar anatomy 
of the temporal bone, including the middle ear ossicular chains and inner ear to 
humans, than in comparison with that of rodents. Here, we report a reproducible, 
safe, and rational surgical approach to the cochlear round window niche for the
drug delivery to the inner ear of the common marmoset. We adopted posterior
tympanotomy, a procedure used clinically in human surgery, to avoid manipulation 
of the tympanic membrane that may cause conductive hearing loss. This surgical
procedure did not lead to any significant hearing loss. This approach was
possible due to the large bulla structure of the common marmoset, although the
lateral semicircular canal and vertical portion of the facial nerve should be
carefully considered. This surgical method allows us to perform the safe and
accurate administration of drugs without hearing loss, which is of great
importance in obtaining pre-clinical proof of concept for translational research.

Vocalizations are often used by animals to communicate and mediate social
interactions. Animals may benefit from eavesdropping on calls from other species 
to avoid predation and thus increase their chances of survival. Here we use both 
observational and experimental evidence to investigate eavesdropping and how
acoustic signals may mediate interactions between two sympatric and endemic
primate species (common marmosets and blonde capuchin monkeys) in a fragment of
Atlantic Rainforest in Northeastern Brazil. We observed 22 natural vocal
encounters between the study species, but no evident visual or physical contact
over the study period. These two species seem to use the same area throughout the
day, but at different times. We broadcasted alarm and long distance calls to and 
from both species as well as two control stimuli (i.e., forest background noise
and a loud call from an Amazonian primate) in our playback experiments. Common
marmosets showed anti-predator behavior (i.e., vigilance and flight) when exposed
to blonde capuchin calls both naturally and experimentally. However, blonde
capuchin monkeys showed no anti-predator behavior in response to common marmoset 
calls. Blonde capuchins uttered long distance calls and looked in the direction
of the speaker following exposure to their own long distance call, whereas they
fled when exposed to their own alarm calls. Both blonde capuchin monkeys and
common marmosets showed fear behaviors in response to the loud call from a
primate species unknown to them, and showed no apparent response to the forest
background noise. Common marmoset responses to blonde capuchin calls suggests
that the latter is a potential predator. Furthermore, common marmosets appear to 
be eavesdropping on calls from blonde capuchin monkeys to avoid potentially
costly encounters with them.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a nonhuman primate that is used for
preclinical research on stem cell transplantation therapies due to its similarity
to human beings as well as its small size, enabling researchers to perform
experiments without preparing a large number of cells. In this study, we
developed a marmoset hepatic fibrosis model for regenerative medicine research.
Six female marmosets aged 4-6 years were administered thioacetamide (TAA) at a
dose of 2.5-40 mg/kg two or three times a week. Hepatic fibrosis was assessed by 
liver biopsy when blood chemistry indicated liver damage. Administration of TAA
increased total bile acid, aspartate aminotransferase, and total bilirubin and
decreased serum albumin levels. Following more than 11 weeks of continuous
injection of TAA, histological analyses detected hepatic fibrosis in all animals.
Type IV collagen 7S serum levels in animals with hepatic fibrosis were
significantly higher than in normal animals as a possible marker of hepatic
fibrosis in marmosets. Serial liver biopsies following the last administration of
TAA revealed that induced fibrosis remained up to 11 weeks. The results suggest
that continuous TAA administration induces persistent hepatic fibrosis in the
common marmoset and this nonhuman primate hepatic fibrosis model have the
possibility to evaluate the therapeutic effects of test samples to ameliorate
hepatic fibrosis.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) represents a promising nonhuman primate 
model for the study of human diseases because of its small size, ease of
handling, and availability of gene-modified animals. Here, we aimed to devise
reproductive technology for marmoset spermatid injection using immature males for
a possible rapid generational turnover. Spermatids at each step could be
identified easily by their morphology under differential interference microscopy:
thus, early round spermatids had a round nucleus with a few nucleolus-like
structures and abundant cytoplasm, as in other mammals. The spermatids acquired
oocyte-activating capacity at the late round spermatid stage, as confirmed by the
resumption of meiosis and Ca2+ oscillations upon injection into mouse oocytes.
The spermatids could be cryopreserved efficiently with a simple medium containing
glycerol and CELL BANKER®. Late round or elongated spermatids first appeared at
10-12 months of age, 6-8 months before sexual maturation. Marmoset oocytes
microinjected with frozen-thawed late round or elongated spermatids retrieved
from a 12-month-old male marmoset developed to the 8-cell stage without the need 
for artificial oocyte activation stimulation. Thus, it might be possible to
shorten the intergeneration time by spermatid injection, from 2 years (by natural
mating) to 13-15 months including gestation.

Objectives In order to facilitate the study of vocalizations in emerging genetic 
common marmoset models of neurodegenerative disorders, we aimed to analyze
call-type changes across age in a translational research environment. We
hypothesized that acoustic parameters of vocalizations would change with age,
reflecting growth of the vocal apparatus and a maturation of control needed to
make adult-like calls. Methods Nineteen developing common marmosets were
longitudinally video- and audio-recorded between the ages of 1-149 days in a
naturalistic setting without any vocalization elicitation protocol. Vocalizations
were coded for call type (cry, tsik, trill, phee, and trill-phee) and analyzed
for duration (sec), minimum and maximum frequency (Hz), and bandwidth (Hz). Mixed
model linear regressions were performed to assess the effects of age on call
parameters listed above for each call type. Results Cries decreased in duration
(P = 0.038), maximum frequency (P = 0.047), and bandwidth (P = 0.023) with age.
Tsik calls decreased in duration (P = 0.002) and increased in minimum frequency
(P = 0.004) and maximum frequency (P = 0.005) with age. Trill calls increased in 
duration (P = 0.003), and trillphee bandwidth (P = 0.031) decreased with age.
Discussion Our results demonstrate that development of common marmoset
vocalizations is call type dependent and that changes in acoustic parameters can 
be detected without complex vocalization elicitation paradigms or specialized
audio recording equipment. Thus, we demonstrate the feasibility of a naturalistic
protocol to collect and objectively analyze marmoset vocalizations
longitudinally. This approach may be useful for studying vocal communication
deficits in genetic models of neurodegenerative disorders.

We present a new 3D digital brain atlas of the non-human primate, common marmoset
monkey (Callithrix jacchus), with MRI and coregistered Nissl histology data. To
the best of our knowledge this is the first comprehensive digital 3D brain atlas 
of the common marmoset having normalized multi-modal data, cortical and
sub-cortical segmentation, and in a common file format (NIfTI). The atlas can be 
registered to new data, is useful for connectomics, functional studies,
simulation and as a reference. The atlas was based on previously published work
but we provide several critical improvements to make this release valuable for
researchers. Nissl histology images were processed to remove illumination and
shape artifacts and then normalized to the MRI data. Brain region segmentation is
provided for both hemispheres. The data is in the NIfTI format making it easy to 
integrate into neuroscience pipelines, whereas the previous atlas was in an
inaccessible file format. We also provide cortical, mid-cortical and white matter
boundary segmentations useful for visualization and analysis.

Hybrid palm oil, which contains higher levels of oleic acid and lower saturated
fatty acids in comparison with African palm oil, has been proposed to be somehow 
equivalent to extra virgin olive oil. However, the biological effects of its
consumption are poorly described. Here we have explored the effects of its
overconsumption on lipid metabolism in a non-human primate model, the common
marmoset. Dietary supplementation of marmoset with hyperlipidic diet containing
hybrid palm oil for 3 months did not modify plasma lipids levels, but increased
glucose levels as compared to the supplementation with African palm oil. Liver
volume was unexpectedly found to be more increased in marmosets consuming hybrid 
palm oil than in those consuming African palm oil. Hepatic total lipid content
and circulating transaminases were dramatically increased in animals consuming
hybrid palm oil, as well as an increased degree of fibrosis. Analysis of liver
miRNAs showed a selective modulation of certain miRNAs by hybrid palm oil, some
of which were predicted to target genes involved in cell adhesion molecules and
peroxisomal pathways. Our data suggest that consumption of hybrid palm oil should
be monitored carefully, as its overconsumption compared to that of African palm
oil could involve important alterations to hepatic metabolism.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a useful experimental animal to
evaluate the pharmacokinetics of drug candidates. Cytochrome P450 (P450) 2B
enzyme in marmoset livers has been identified; however, only limited information 
on the enzymatic properties and distribution has been available. Marmoset P450
2B6 amino acids showed high sequence identities (>86%) with those of primates
including humans and cynomolgus monkeys. Phylogenetic analysis using amino acid
sequences indicated that marmoset P450 2B6 was closer to human and cynomolgus
monkey P450 2B6 than to P450 2B orthologs of other species, including pigs, dogs,
rabbits and rodents. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis using
specific primers showed P450 2B6 mRNA predominantly expressed in livers among the
five marmoset tissues, similar to those of humans and cynomolgus monkeys.
Marmoset P450 2B6 heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli membranes oxidized
7-ethoxycoumarin, pentoxyresorufin, propofol and testosterone, at roughly similar
rates to those of humans and/or cynomolgus monkeys. A high capacity of marmoset
P450 2B6 with propofol 4-hydroxylation (at low ionic strength conditions) with a 
low Km value was relatively comparable to that for marmoset livers. These results
collectively indicated a high propofol 4-hydroxylation activity of P450 2B6
expressed in marmoset livers.

The common marmoset (CM; Callithrix jacchus) is a small New World monkey with a
high rate of pregnancy and is maintained in closed colonies as an experimental
animal species. Although CMs are used for immunological research, such as studies
of autoimmune disease and infectious disease, their immunological characteristics
are less defined than those of other nonhuman primates. We and others have
analyzed antigen recognition-related molecules, the development of hematopoietic 
stem cells (HSCs), and the molecules involved in the immune response. CMs
systemically express Caja-G, a major histocompatibility complex class I molecule,
and the ortholog of HLA-G, a suppressive nonclassical HLA class I molecule. HSCs 
express CD117, while CD34 is not essential for multipotency. CD117+ cells
developed into all hematopoietic cell lineages, but compared with human HSCs, B
cells did not extensively develop when HSCs were transplanted into an
immunodeficient mouse. Although autoimmune models have been successfully
established, sensitization of CMs with some bacteria induced a low protective
immunity. In CMs, B cells were observed in the periphery, but IgG levels were
very low compared with those in humans and mice. This evidence suggests that CM
immunity is partially suppressed systemically. Such immune regulation might
benefit pregnancy in CMs, which normally deliver dizygotic twins, the placentae
of which are fused and the immune cells of which are mixed. In this review, we
describe the CM immune system and discuss the possibility of using CMs as a model
of human immunity.

Animal models have been critical in building evidence that the prenatal
experience and intrauterine environment are capable of exerting profound and
permanent effects on metabolic health through developmental programming of
obesity. However, despite physiological and evolutionary similarities, nonhuman
primate models are relatively rare. The common marmoset monkey ( Callithrix
jacchus) is a New World monkey that has been used as a biomedical model for well 
more than 50 years and has recently been framed as an appropriate model for
exploring early-life impacts on later health and disease. The spontaneous,
multifactorial, and early-life development of obesity in the common marmoset make
it a valuable research model for advancing our knowledge about the role of the
prenatal and placental mechanisms involved in developmental programming of
obesity. This paper provides a brief overview of obesity in the common marmoset, 
followed by a discussion of marmoset reproduction and placental characteristics. 
We then discuss the occurrence and utility of variable intrauterine environments 
in developmental programming in marmosets. Evidence of developmental programming 
of obesity will be given, and finally, we put forward future directions and
innovations for including the placenta in developmental programming of obesity in
the common marmoset.

Banisteriopsis caapi (B. caapi) contains harmine, harmaline, and
tetrahydroharmine, has monoamine oxidase inhibitory activity, and has reported
antiparkinsonian activity in humans when imbibed as a tea; however, its effects
are poorly documented. For this reason, motor function was assessed in
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-treated common marmosets following
administration of B. caapi extract (28.4-113.6 mg/kg; po), harmine (0.1 and
0.3 mg/kg; sc), and selegiline (10 mg/kg; sc), alone or with a submaximal dose of
L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA; 4-7 mg/kg). L-DOPA reversed motor
disability, increased locomotor activity, and induced moderate dyskinesia.
B. caapi did not increase locomotor activity or induce dyskinesia but at 56.8 and
113.6 mg/kg improved motor disability. The L-DOPA response was unaltered by
co-administration of B. caapi. Harmine (0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg) produced a mild
improvement in motor disability without affecting locomotor activity or
dyskinesia but had no effect on the L-DOPA-induced antiparkinsonian response.
Selegiline (10 mg/kg) alone improved motor function to the same extent as L-DOPA,
but with only mild dyskinesia, and did not alter the response to L-DOPA, although
dyskinesia was reduced. The findings suggest that B. caapi alone has a mild
antiparkinsonian effect but does not enhance the L-DOPA response or reduce
dyskinesia.

The oculomotor system is the most thoroughly understood sensorimotor system in
the brain, due in large part to electrophysiological studies carried out in
macaque monkeys trained to perform oculomotor tasks. A disadvantage of the
macaque model is that many cortical oculomotor areas of interest lie within
sulci, making high-density array and laminar recordings impractical. Many
techniques of molecular biology developed in rodents, such as optogenetic
manipulation of neuronal subtypes, are also limited in this species. The common
marmoset ( Callithrix jacchus) possesses a smooth cortex, allowing easy access to
frontoparietal oculomotor areas, and may bridge the gap between systems
neuroscience in macaques and molecular techniques. Techniques for restraint,
training, and neural recording in these animals have been well developed in
auditory neuroscience. Those for oculomotor neuroscience, however, remain at a
relatively early stage. In this article we provide details of a custom-designed
restraint chair for marmosets, a combination head restraint/recording chamber
allowing access to cortical oculomotor areas and providing stability suitable for
eye movement and neural recordings, as well as a training protocol for oculomotor
tasks. We additionally report the results of a psychophysical study in marmosets 
trained to perform a saccade task using these methods, showing that, as in rhesus
and humans, marmosets exhibit a "gap effect," a decrease in reaction time when
the fixation stimulus is removed before the onset of a visual saccade target.
These results are the first evidence of this effect in marmosets and support the 
common marmoset model for neurophysiological investigations of oculomotor
control. NEW & NOTEWORTHY The ability to carry out neuronal recordings in
behaving primates has provided a wealth of information regarding the neural
circuits underlying the control of eye movements. Such studies require restraint 
of the animal within a primate chair, head fixation, methods of acclimating the
animals to this restraint, and the use of operant conditioning methods for
training on oculomotor tasks. In contrast to the macaque model, relatively few
studies have reported in detail methods for use in the common marmoset. In this
report we detail custom-designed equipment and methods by which we have used to
successfully train head-restrained marmosets to perform basic oculomotor tasks.

The in vivo model of pollinosis has been established using rodents, but the model
cannot completely mimic human pollinosis. We used Callithrix jacchus, the common 
marmoset (CM), to establish a pollinosis animal model using intranasal weekly
administration of cedar pollen extract with cholera toxin adjuvant. Some of the
treated CMs exhibited the symptoms of snitching, excess nasal mucus and/or
sneezing, but the period was very short, and the symptoms disappeared after
several weeks. The CD4+CD25+ cell ratio in the peripheral blood increased in CMs 
quickly after the nasal administration of cedar pollen extract, but the timing
was not parallel with the symptoms. IL-10 mRNA was enhanced in the peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), suggesting CM-induced tolerance for cedar pollen
administration. Similarly, Foxp3 mRNA was also detected in the PBMC. Additive
sensitization of these CMs with Ascaris egg administration did not enhance
chronic inflammation of type 1 allergy to induce the symptoms. These results
suggest that the environmental immune cells develop transient allergic symptoms
and subsequent immune-tolerance in the intranasally sensitized CMs.

The common marmoset has been proposed as a potential alternative to macaque
monkey as a primate model for neuroscience and medical research. Here, we have
newly developed a stereotaxic neuronal recording system for awake marmosets under
the head-fixed condition by modifying that for macaque monkeys. Using this
system, we recorded neuronal activity in the cerebral cortex of awake marmosets
and successfully identified the primary motor cortex by intracortical
microstimulation. Neuronal activities of deep brain structures, such as the basal
ganglia, thalamus, and cerebellum, in awake marmosets were also successfully
recorded referring to magnetic resonance images. Our system is suitable for
functional mapping of the brain, since the large recording chamber allows access 
to arbitrary regions over almost the entire brain, and the recording electrode
can be easily moved stereotaxically from one site to another. In addition, our
system is desirable for neuronal recording during task performance to assess
motor skills and cognitive function, as the marmoset sits in the marmoset chair
and can freely use its hands. Moreover, our system can be used in combination
with cutting-edge techniques, such as two-photon imaging and optogenetic
manipulation. This recording system will contribute to boosting neuroscience and 
medical research using marmosets.

In our previous study based on hsp60 PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism
and 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we stated that the bifidobacterial strains isolated
from the individual faecal samples of five baby common marmosets constituted
different phylogenetically isolated groups of the genus Bifidobacterium. In that 
study, we also proposed that these isolated groups potentially represented novel 
species of the genus Bifidobacterium. Out of them, Bifidobacterium aesculapii,
Bifidobacterium myosotis, Bifidobacterium tissieri and Bifidobacterium hapali,
have been described recently. Another strain, designated MRM 8.19T, has been
classified as member of the genus Bifidobacterium on the basis of positive
results for fructose-6-phosphate phosphoketolase activity and analysis of partial
16S rRNA, hsp60, clpC, dnaJ, dnaG and rpoB gene sequences. Analysis of 16S rRNA
and hsp60 gene sequences revealed that strain MRM 8.19T was related to B.
tissieri DSM 100201T (95.8 %) and to Bifidobacterium bifidum ATCC 29521T
(93.7 %), respectively. The DNA G+C composition was 63.7 mol% and the
peptidoglycan structure was l-Orn(Lys)-l-Ser. Based on the phylogenetic,
genotypic and phenotypic data reported, strain MRM 8.19T represents a novel taxon
within the genus Bifidobacterium for which the name Bifidobacterium catulorum sp.
nov. (type strain MRM 8.19T=DSM 103154T=JCM 31794T) is proposed.

Cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis, Old World Monkeys) and common marmosets 
(Callithrix jacchus, New World Monkeys) have been widely, and expectedly, used as
non-human primate models in drug development studies. Major drug-metabolizing
cytochrome P450 (P450) enzymes information is now available that supports these
primate species as animal models, and it is established that multiple forms of
cynomolgus monkey and common marmoset P450 enzymes have generally similar
substrate recognition functionality to human P450 enzymes. This research update
provides information on genetic polymorphisms of P450 enzymes in cynomolgus
monkey and common marmoset like human P450 enzymes. Information on rhesus monkeys
(Macaca mulatta), another macaque species used in drug metabolism studies, is
also included for comparison. Among a variety of cynomolgus monkey P450 variants 
investigated, typical examples include individual pharmacokinetic data for
efavirenz and R-warfarin associated with cynomolgus monkey P450 2C9 (formerly
2C43) and 2C19 (2C75) variants, respectively, and for R-omeprazole and S-warfarin
associated with marmoset P450 2C19 variants. These findings provide a foundation 
for understanding the individual pharmacokinetic and toxicological results in
non-human primates as preclinical models and will help to further support
understanding of molecular mechanisms of human P450 function. In addition to
these polymorphic P450 enzymes, effects of aging on some drug clearances mediated
by cynomolgus monkey and common marmoset P450 enzymes were found in elder animals
or animals pretreated with rifampicin. This review describes genetic and acquired
individual differences in cynomolgus monkey and common marmoset P450 enzymes
involved in drug oxidation associated with pharmacological and/or toxicological
effects.

Cortisol levels are often used as a physiological measure of the stress response 
in captive primates, with non-invasive measures of this being an important step
in welfare assessment. We report a method of collecting saliva samples
voluntarily from unrestrained captive common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus), and 
validate an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique previously unused
in this species. Saliva samples were collected from marmosets housed in pairs in 
a UK laboratory. The assay showed parallelism, precision, accuracy and
sensitivity, meeting the criteria typically used to investigate the effectiveness
of new analytical techniques. Use of Salimetrics® Oral Swabs considerably
increased the amount of cortisol recovered in comparison with previous studies
using cotton buds. However, while use of banana on the swabs can encourage
chewing, it may influence results. Although increases in cortisol levels have
traditionally been interpreted as an indicator of stress in primates, there are
many factors that affect the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, with some
studies showing decreases in cortisol levels post-stressor. Following a likely
stressful event (capture for weighing), we also found cortisol levels
significantly decreased, possibly due to social buffering or 'blunting' of the
HPA axis. Order of weighing also had an effect. The method therefore provided an 
effective non-invasive means of assessing acute changes in cortisol level that
may be more useful than previous methods, improving our ability to study
physiological aspects of welfare in primates. We discuss methodological
considerations, as well as implications of using cortisol as a measure of stress.

Here we report a retrospective analysis of negative effects of routine
enrofloxacin treatment of recurrent diarrhea on the ovary and the developing
oocytes of the common marmoset, a small New World primate. The most deleterious
effect on oocytes was observed about two months post treatment suggesting that
the enrofloxacin effect is on early growing follicles. Manifestations of toxicity
included decreased numbers of growing follicles and recovered culturable oocytes,
as well as signs of early atresia of granulosa cells. In addition, increased
amounts of holed stroma after treatment strongly suggested increased death of the
early growing follicles. Of the oocytes judged to be of adequate quality for
culture, maturation rates were not affected but fertilization of in vitro matured
MII oocytes and subsequent cleavage rates were severely reduced in the
enrofloxacin treated animals. Further, the arrested oocytes, which failed to
mature or fertilize, showed obvious meiotic spindle abnormalities.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a New-World monkey of growing
interest in neuroscience. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an essential tool
to unveil the anatomical and functional organization of the marmoset brain. To
facilitate identification of regions of interest, it is desirable to register MR 
images to an atlas of the brain. However, currently available atlases of the
marmoset brain are mainly based on 2D histological data, which are difficult to
apply to 3D imaging techniques. Here, we constructed a 3D digital atlas based on 
high-resolution ex-vivo MRI images, including magnetization transfer ratio (a
T1-like contrast), T2w images, and multi-shell diffusion MRI. Based on the
multi-modal MRI images, we manually delineated 54 cortical areas and 16
subcortical regions on one hemisphere of the brain (the core version). The 54
cortical areas were merged into 13 larger cortical regions according to their
locations to yield a coarse version of the atlas, and also parcellated into 106
sub-regions using a connectivity-based parcellation method to produce a refined
atlas. Finally, we compared the new atlas set with existing histology atlases and
demonstrated its applications in connectome studies, and in resting state and
stimulus-based fMRI. The atlas set has been integrated into the
widely-distributed neuroimaging data analysis software AFNI and SUMA, providing a
readily usable multi-modal template space with multi-level anatomical labels
(including labels from the Paxinos atlas) that can facilitate various
neuroimaging studies of marmosets.

Experimental intranasal infection of marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) with calpox
virus results in fatal disease. Route and dose used for viral inoculation of the 
test animals mimics the natural transmission of smallpox, thus representing a
suitable model to study pathogenesis and to evaluate new vaccines against
orthopoxvirus infection. However, the pathogenic mechanisms leading to death are 
still unclear. Therefore, our study aimed at investigating the kinetics of
pathological alterations to clarify the pathogenesis in calpox virus infection.
Following intranasal inoculation with two different viral doses, common marmosets
were sacrificed on days 3, 5, 7, 10 and 12 post inoculation. Collected tissue was
screened using histopathology, immunohistochemistry, transmission electron
microscopy, and virological assays. Our data suggest that primary replication
took place in nasal and bronchial epithelia followed by secondary replication in 
submandibular lymph nodes and spleen. Parallel to viremia at day 7, virus was
detectable in many organs, mainly located in epithelial cells and macrophages, as
well as in endothelial cells. Based on the onset of clinical signs, the
histological and ultrastructural lesions and the immunohistochemical distribution
pattern of the virus, the incubation period was defined to last 11 days, which
resembles human smallpox. In conclusion, the data indicate that the calpox model 
is highly suitable for studying orthopoxvirus-induced disease.

BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Bisphenol A (BPA) is an endocrine disruptor that is
widely used in the manufacture of polycarbonate plastics, epoxy resins and dental
sealants. It is known to have adverse effects on spermatogenesis in rodents. This
study was aimed to evaluate the effects of BPA in adult common marmoset owing to 
its similarities with human spermatogenesis.
METHODS: Sixteen marmosets were divided into four groups (n=4 per group) and
given oral doses of BPA (2.5, 12.5 and 25 μg/kg BW/day) for 70 days to cover two 
spermatogenic cycles, and the control group received only vehicle (honey). Testes
were processed for histological and transmission electron microscopy studies.
RESULTS: Histology of the testis showed sloughing of germ cells into the lumen,
increase in interstitial space and vacuolation of Sertoli cell cytoplasm.
Ultrastructural analysis of the testis revealed several degenerative effects on
the basement membrane, Sertoli cells, Leydig cells and other developing germ
cells in the 12.5 and 25 μg/kg BW/day groups as compared to control.
INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: The observed ultrastructural changes caused by BPA 
in testicular morphology might be indicative of a perturbed sperm production.
Considering the genetic and spermatogenic similarities of common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus) and humans, the study findings are of significance. Further 
studies are, however, needed to elucidate the mechanism of action.

Pheromones are crucial for eliciting innate responses and inducing social and
sexual behaviors in mammals. The vomeronasal receptor 1 genes, V1Rs, encode
members of a pheromone receptor family that are mainly expressed in the
vomeronasal organ (VNO). The V1R family shows extraordinary variety in gene
number among vertebrates owing to successive gene gains and losses during
evolution. Such diversity is believed to reflect a degree of dependence on the
VNO. We investigated V1R evolution in primate lineages closely related to humans 
because these VNOs show a trend toward degeneration. We performed extensive
phylogenetic analyses for V1Rs from a broad range of primate species. Although
the decline of intact genes was evident in anthropoids (hominoids, Old World
monkeys and New World monkeys), we found that a certain number of intact genes
persist in New World monkeys. In one New World monkey species, the common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), we examined seven putatively functional V1Rs using
in situ hybridization and reverse transcription-PCR. Based on their mRNA
expression patterns in the VNO and other organs, two types of V1Rs emerged: the
canonical class with VNO-specific expression, and a second group having more
ubiquitous expression in various organs as well as VNO. Furthermore, phylogenetic
analysis revealed that the class with the more widespread expression had been
retained longer in evolution than the VNO-specific type. We propose that the
acquisition of a novel non-VNO-related function(s) may have led to the survival
of a small but persistent number of V1Rs in anthropoid primates.

BACKGROUND: Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) induced by
self-myelin antigen is a widely used in multiple sclerosis (MS) model for
preclinical studies of new therapeutics and potential pathogenesis. By comparison
with rodent EAE models, EAE models in primates are more similar to MS. Some
groups have developed EAE models in primates by using common marmoset (Callithrix
jacchus). However, this model has some limitations. EAE in cynomolgus monkey
(Macaque fasciculrais) could overcome these limitations.
OBJECTIVES: The main objective of this study was to establish an ideal EAE
cynomolgus monkey model resembling human MS by immunizing human myelin
oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) protein.
METHODS: In this study, six female cynomolgus monkeys were divided into two
separate experiment groups and one monkey as the control. EAE was induced in
cynomolgus monkey by immunizing with the recombinant human myelin oligodendrocyte
glycoprotein extracellular domain (1-125) (rhMOG1-125) and a synthetic peptide,
representing peptide 34-56 of human myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein
(MOG34-56) in complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) by subcutaneous multipoint
immunization in the armpit and inguinal region and in combination with
intravenous injection of pertussis toxin, and subsequent booster immunizations
with the same dose of antigen in incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA) until the
animals developed clinically significant EAE (score≥2). The body weight, clinical
scores, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), histopathology, antibody, cytokine
profiling and antigen-specific lymphocyte proliferation were evaluated.
RESULTS: The results showed that despite the different time intervals between
onset and significant neurological deficits, all the cynomolgus monkeys immunized
with rhMOG1-125 or MOG34-56 developed clinically significant acute fulminant or
mild forms of EAE, with a success rate of 100%. The clinical courses were obvious
heterogeneity which closely resembles MS. MOG34-56 immunization was much milder
compared with rhMOG1-125 immunized individuals, at least in cynomolgus monkeys.
Inflammation and demyelinated lesions were present in the brains and spinal
cords. Immune profiling revealed high IgG levels associated with early onset of
EAE but not the course of the disease. Significant antigen-specific T lymphocyte 
responses against immunodominant epitopes of MOG were also detected.
CONCLUSION: Our results indicated rhMOG1-125 and MOG34-56 could induce
successfully EAE models resembling MS in cynomolgus monkeys. The synergistic
action of anti-myelin T cells and Abs during the pathogenesis of EAE could
establish a more ideal EAE model.

Oxidative stress is increasingly implicated as a co-factor of tissue injury in
inflammatory/demyelinating disorders of the central nervous system (CNS), such as
multiple sclerosis (MS). While rodent experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis
(EAE) models diverge from human demyelinating disorders with respect to limited
oxidative injury, we observed that in a non-human primate (NHP) model for MS,
namely EAE in the common marmoset, key pathological features of the disease were 
recapitulated, including oxidative tissue injury. Here, we investigated the
presence of oxidative injury in another NHP EAE model, i.e. in rhesus macaques,
which yields an acute demyelinating disease, which may more closely resemble
acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) than MS. Rhesus monkey EAE diverges
from marmoset EAE by abundant neutrophil recruitment into the CNS and destructive
injury to white matter. This difference prompted us to investigate to which
extent the oxidative pathway features elicited in MS and marmoset EAE are
reflected in the acute rhesus monkey EAE model. The rhesus EAE brain was
characterized by widespread demyelination and active lesions containing numerous 
phagocytic cells and to a lesser extent T cells. We observed induction of the
oxidative stress pathway, including injury, with a predilection of p22phox
expression in neutrophils and macrophages/microglia. In addition, changes in iron
were observed. These results indicate that pathogenic mechanisms in the rhesus
EAE model may differ from the marmoset EAE and MS brain due to the neutrophil
involvement, but may in the end lead to similar induction of oxidative stress and
injury.

Interest in the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) as a primate model animal
has grown recently, in part due to the successful demonstration of transgenic
marmosets. However, there is some debate as to the suitability of marmosets,
compared to more widely used animal models, such as the macaque monkey and mouse.
Especially, the usage of marmoset for animal models of human cognition and mental
disorders, is still yet to be fully explored. To examine the prospects of the
marmoset model for neuroscience research, the Marmoset Gene Atlas
(https://gene-atlas.bminds.brain.riken.jp/) provides a whole brain gene
expression atlas in the common marmoset. We employ in situ hybridization (ISH) to
systematically analyze gene expression in neonate marmoset brains, which allows
us to compare expression with other model animals such as mouse. We anticipate
that these data will provide sufficient information to develop tools that enable 
us to reveal marmoset brain structure, function, cellular and molecular
organization for primate brain research.

The differential effects of dopaminergic drugs with different pharmacological
profiles were investigated with respect to spontaneous motor activity in the
common marmoset following pretreatment with a bilateral brain infusion of
6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). Three marmosets received infusions of 6-OHDA (either 
30 or 40 μg/side) into the bilateral dopamine-rich area running from the
substantia nigra to the striatum. The motor activity of the 6-OHDA marmosets was 
compared with that of three intact marmosets. Following the administration of
apomorphine (0.5 and 1 mg/kg, subcutaneously), the 6-OHDA group showed a tendency
toward a brief increase in activity counts, suggesting denervation
supersensitivity at the dopamine receptors. After the administration of
methamphetamine (1 and 2 mg/kg, subcutaneously), the 6-OHDA group showed a
significant decrease in activity counts, indicating limited dopamine release from
the degenerated neurons. After the administration of L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine
(10 and 20 mg/kg, orally), the 6-OHDA group showed a significant increase in
activity counts without hyperexcitation, consistent with the contribution of
exogenous L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine toward dopamine synthesis in the
degenerated neurons. The present findings indicate that bilateral brain infusion 
of 6-OHDA in the marmoset may have preclinical utility as a primate model for
investigating the behavioral properties of dopaminergic drugs in brains with
dopaminergic neural deficits.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is an experimental animal that is
considered suitable for the creation of next-generation human disease models. It 
has recently been used in the reproductive technology field. Oocytes can be
effectively collected from female marmosets via ovarian stimulation with
injections of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and human chorionic gonadotropin
(hCG). The oocytes, collected about 28 h after the hCG injection, include both
premature oocytes and postmature (in vivo matured; IVO) oocytes, and the
premature oocytes can be matured by in vitro culture (in vitro matured; IVM).
Although IVM and IVO oocytes are equivalent in appearance at the MII stage, it
remains unclear whether there are differences in their properties. Therefore, we 
investigated their in vitro fertilization and developmental capacities and
cytoskeletal statuses. Our findings revealed that the IVM and IVO oocytes had
similar fertilization rates but that no IVO oocytes could develop to the
blastocyst stage. Additionally, IVO oocytes showed abnormal cytoskeletal
formation. It is concluded that IVM oocytes maintain normal function, whereas IVO
oocytes would be affected by aging and other factors when they remain for a long 
time in the ovary.

Common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) have been recognized as a useful small
non-human primate model in preclinical testing for drug development. In this
study, a cDNA of novel ATP-dependent efflux transporter ABCB1 was cloned from
marmoset liver tissue. Marmoset ABCB1 cDNA encodes a protein of 1279 amino acid
residues (MW = 141.4 kDa) containing characteristic regions of an ATP-binding
cassette (ABC) protein, two hydrophobic transmembrane regions and two cytoplasmic
nucleotide-binding regions, similar to human ABCB1. The deduced amino acid
sequences were more highly identical (95%) to those of human ABCB1 compared with 
non-primate species such as dogs, pigs and rodents (79-90%). A close evolutionary
relationship of ABCB1 among marmosets, cynomolgus and rhesus monkeys and humans
was evident from a phylogenetic analysis using ABCB1 amino acid sequences from
primates, dogs, pigs and rodents. Tissue distribution analyses by quantitative
reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction indicated that marmoset ABCB1
mRNA was most abundant in kidneys, followed by small intestines and livers,
similar to human ABCB1, and marmoset ABCB1 proteins in these tissues were also
detected by immunoblotting. These results indicated that the primary structure
and tissue distribution of ABCB1 in marmosets were similar to those of humans,
suggesting similar molecular characteristics of ABCB1 between marmosets and
humans.

The eyes absent (EYA)-like genes are essential for the formation of sensory
organs among fly (Drosophila melanogaster) and mammals. EYA4, one of the
vertebrate genes of Eya family, is reported to be causative for late-onset
mid-frequency sensorineural hearing loss in humans, while Eya4-deficient mice
exhibited congenital profound deafness and otitis media with effusion due to the 
eustachian tube dysmorphology. Because of the species difference in the
phenotype, the pathophysiology of EYA4 in the human cochlea has yet to be
elucidated. Here, we examine the expression pattern of EYA4 in the cochlea of
common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a non-human primate. The results indicated 
a distinct expression pattern of EYA4 in the adult marmoset cochleae, especially 
strong in all supporting cells, while in mouse their expressions were diminished.
Interestingly, EYA4 expression in the hair cells, supporting cells and neurons
was co-localized with sine oculis homeobox-SIX1, a transcription factor essential
for the transcriptional activity of EYA4. The results revealed inter-species
differences in the expression pattern of EYA4 gene in supporting cells between
primates and rodents. The results also indicated a fundamental role of EYA4 in
the primate auditory cells. Experiments with primate models such as marmosets or 
with human cochlear cells may provide cues about the unknown pathogenesis of
EYA4-related hearing loss.

1. Simulated clearances of R-warfarin and efavirenz were recently reported for
individual cynomolgus monkeys genotyped for cytochrome P450 2C19 and 2C9,
respectively. To expand and verify this modeling procedure, simulations of
R/S-omeprazole and R/S-warfarin clearances after oral administrations in
individual marmosets were performed using individual simplified physiologically
based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling consisting of gut, liver and central
compartments. 2. Pharmacokinetics of R/S-omeprazole were chirally determined
using the previously reported plasma microsamples in this study. The areas under 
the plasma concentration/time curves (AUC) of R-omeprazole and S-warfarin, but
not S-omeprazole and R-warfarin, after oral administrations in the P450 2C19
homozygous mutant group were significantly higher than those in the wild-type
group. These modeled hepatic intrinsic clearances were also significantly
associated with the marmoset P450 2C19 genotypes. Other parameter values, e.g.
absorption rate constants or systemic circulation volumes, were not likely
determining factors. 3. The reported individual AUC values measured in 4-6
marmosets after oral R-omeprazole and S-warfarin administrations were
significantly correlated with the AUC values predicted using the PBPK models
after virtual administrations. 4. This study indicates that clearances of
R-omeprazole, S-warfarin and related medicines associated with polymorphic P450
2C19 in individual marmosets can be simulated using simplified individual PBPK
models.

Increasing evidence suggests that personality structure differs between species, 
but the evolutionary reasons for this variation are not fully understood. We
built on earlier research on New World monkeys to further elucidate the evolution
of personality structure in primates. We therefore examined personality in 100
family-reared adult common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) from 3 colonies on a
60-item questionnaire. Principal components analyses revealed 5 domains that were
largely similar to those found in a previous study on captive, ex-pet, or
formerly laboratory-housed marmosets that were housed in a sanctuary. The
interrater reliabilities of domain scores were consistent with the interrater
reliabilities of domain scores found in other species, including humans. Four
domainsdmdash;conscientiousness, agreeableness, inquisitiveness, and
assertiveness-resembled personality domains identified in other nonhuman
primates. The remaining domain, patience, was specific to common marmosets. We
used linear models to test for sex and age differences in the personality
domains. Males were lower than females in patience, and this difference was
smaller in older marmosets. Older marmosets were lower in inquisitiveness.
Finally, older males and younger females had higher scores in agreeableness than 
younger males and older females. These findings suggest that cooperative breeding
may have promoted the evolution of social cognition and influenced the structure 
of marmoset prosocial personality characteristics. (PsycINFO Database Record

The modulation of ion channel activity by lipids is increasingly recognized as a 
fundamental component of cellular signalling. The transient receptor potential
mucolipin (TRPML) channel family belongs to the TRP superfamily and is composed
of three members: TRPML1-TRPML3. TRPMLs are the major Ca2+-permeable channels on 
late endosomes and lysosomes (LEL). They regulate the release of Ca2+ from
organelles, which is important for various physiological processes, including
organelle trafficking and fusion. Loss-of-function mutations in the MCOLN1 gene, 
which encodes TRPML1, cause the neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorder
mucolipidosis type IV, and a gain-of-function mutation (Ala419Pro) in TRPML3
gives rise to the varitint-waddler (Va) mouse phenotype. Notably, TRPML channels 
are activated by the low-abundance and LEL-enriched signalling lipid
phosphatidylinositol-3,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,5)P2), whereas other
phosphoinositides such as PtdIns(4,5)P2, which is enriched in plasma membranes,
inhibit TRPMLs. Conserved basic residues at the N terminus of the channel are
important for activation by PtdIns(3,5)P2 and inhibition by PtdIns(4,5)P2.
However, owing to a lack of structural information, the mechanism by which TRPML 
channels recognize PtdIns(3,5)P2 and increase their Ca2+ conductance remains
unclear. Here we present the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of a
full-length TRPML3 channel from the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) at an
overall resolution of 2.9 Å. Our structure reveals not only the molecular basis
of ion conduction but also the unique architecture of TRPMLs, wherein the voltage
sensor-like domain is linked to the pore via a cytosolic domain that we term the 
mucolipin domain. Combined with functional studies, these data suggest that the
mucolipin domain is responsible for PtdIns(3,5)P2 binding and subsequent channel 
activation, and that it acts as a 'gating pulley' for lipid-dependent TRPML
gating.

Here, we report the existence of meningeal lymphatic vessels in human and
nonhuman primates (common marmoset monkeys) and the feasibility of noninvasively 
imaging and mapping them in vivo with high-resolution, clinical MRI. On T2-FLAIR 
and T1-weighted black-blood imaging, lymphatic vessels enhance with gadobutrol, a
gadolinium-based contrast agent with high propensity to extravasate across a
permeable capillary endothelial barrier, but not with gadofosveset, a blood-pool 
contrast agent. The topography of these vessels, running alongside dural venous
sinuses, recapitulates the meningeal lymphatic system of rodents. In primates,
meningeal lymphatics display a typical panel of lymphatic endothelial markers by 
immunohistochemistry. This discovery holds promise for better understanding the
normal physiology of lymphatic drainage from the central nervous system and
potential aberrations in neurological diseases.

Optogenetics has potential applications in the study of epilepsy and
neuroprostheses, and for studies on neural circuit dynamics. However, to achieve 
translation to clinical usage, optogenetic interfaces that are capable of chronic
stimulation and monitoring with minimal brain trauma are required. We aimed to
develop a chronically implantable device for photostimulation of the brain of
non-human primates. We used a micro-light-emitting diode (LED) array with a
flexible polyimide film. The array was combined with a whole-cortex
electrocorticographic (ECoG) electrode array for simultaneous photostimulation
and recording. Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) was virally transduced into the cerebral
cortex of common marmosets, and then the device was epidurally implanted into
their brains. We recorded the neural activity during photostimulation of the
awake monkeys for 4 months. The neural responses gradually increased after the
virus injection for ~8 weeks and remained constant for another 8 weeks. The
micro-LED and ECoG arrays allowed semi-invasive simultaneous stimulation and
recording during long-term implantation in the brains of non-human primates. The 
development of this device represents substantial progress in the field of
optogenetic applications.

In the cooperative breeding common marmoset monkey, Callithrix jacchus, fathers
share the care responsibility and energetic load with their mate from the time
their infants are born. However, not all fathers show the same level of
participation in direct infant care. Here we present the first results
demonstrating that fathering style can improve both survival and growth
trajectory of a male's offspring during the first 30 weeks of life and that these
infant outcomes are consistent within a father throughout successive births.
Twenty-four marmoset fathers were tested for their responsiveness to an infant
distress call when their infants were approximately two weeks old. These fathers 
were categorized as either responsive (RS) or nonresponsive (NRS) based on their 
response to the calls. Survival past 1 month was then determined and bi-monthly
weights of current infants through 30 weeks of age were taken. Infant survival to
the first month was significantly higher with RS fathers than with NRS fathers
during this critical time period. Infants from RS fathers also had a higher
growth trajectory with significant differences in body weight in the 28th and
30th week after birth. Only the RS fathers showed a significant increase in serum
testosterone in response to infant cries suggesting a physiological role of
testosterone in the motivation to search for the infant. Furthermore, all
offspring born to RS fathers from subsequent births also showed a significantly
higher survival rate and higher growth trajectory than for offspring of NRS
fathers. These results suggest that fathering style is a consistent trait and
responsive fathers improve infant survival rate and growth during the first 30
weeks. Such fathering style traits may be passed on to the male offspring due to 
environmental or genetic factors.

Morphometry studies of human brain development have revealed characteristics of
some growth patterns, such as gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM), but the
features that make human neurodevelopment distinct from that in other species
remain unclear. Studies of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a small New 
World primate, can provide insights into unique features such as cooperative
behaviors complementary to those from comparative analyses using mouse and rhesus
monkey. In the present study, we analyzed developmental patterns of GM, WM, and
cortical regions with volume measurements using longitudinal sample (23
marmosets; 11 male, 12 female) between the ages of one and 30months. Regional
analysis using a total of 164 magnetic resonance imaging datasets revealed that
GM volume increased before puberty (5.4months), but subsequently declined until
adulthood, whereas WM volume increased rapidly before stabilizing around puberty 
(9.9months). Cortical regions showed similar patterns of increase and decrease,
patterns with global GM but differed in the timing of volume peak and degree of
decline across regions. The progressive-regressive pattern detected in both
global and cortical GM was well correlated to phases of synaptogenesis and
synaptic pruning reported in previous marmoset studies. A rapid increase in WM in
early development may represent a distinctive aspect of human neurodevelopment.
These findings suggest that studies of marmoset brain development can provide
valuable comparative information that will facilitate a deeper understanding of
human brain growth and neurodevelopmental disorders.

Brain development involves spatiotemporally complex microstructural changes. A
number of neuropsychiatric disorders are linked to the neural processes of
development and aging. Thus, it is important to understanding the typical
developmental patterns of various brain structures, which will help to define
critical periods of vulnerability for neural maturation, as well as anatomical
mechanisms of brain structure-related neuropathology. In this study, we used
magnetic resonance imaging to assess development of the orbitofrontal cortex,
cingulate cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus in a non-human primate species, the
common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). We collected a total of 114 T2-weighted and
91 diffusion-weighted scans from 23 animals from infancy to early adulthood.
Quantitative and qualitative evaluation of age-related brain growth patterns
showed non-linear structural developmental changes in all measured brain regions,
consistent with reported human data. Overall, robust volumetric growth was
observed from 1 to 3 months of age (from infancy to the early juvenile period).
This rapid brain growth was associated with the largest decrease in mean, axial, 
and radial diffusivities of diffusion tensor imaging in all brain regions,
suggesting an increase in the number and size of cells, dendrites, and spines
during this period. After this developmental period, the volume of various brain 
regions steadily increased until adolescence (7-13 months of age, depending on
the region). Further, structural connectivity derived from tractography data in
various brain regions continuously changed from infancy to adolescence,
suggesting that the increase in brain volume was related to continued axonal
myelination during adolescence. Thereafter, the volume of the cortical regions
decreased considerably, while there was no change in subcortical regions.
Familial factors, rather than sex, contributed the development of the
front-limbic brain regions. Overall, this study provides further data on the
factors and timing important for normal brain development, and suggest that the
common marmoset is a useful animal model for human neural development.

In primates, over 17 morphological types of retinal ganglion cell have been
distinguished by their dendritic morphology and stratification, but reliable
markers for specific ganglion cell populations are still rare. The calcium
binding protein calretinin is known to be expressed in the inner nuclear and the 
ganglion cell layer of marmoset retina, however, the specific cell type(s)
expressing calretinin in the ganglion cell layer are yet to be determined. Here, 
we identified calretinin positive retinal ganglion cells in the common marmoset
Callithrix jacchus. Double labeling with the ganglion cell marker RBPMS
demonstrated that the large majority (80%) of the calretinin positive cells in
the ganglion cell layer are ganglion cells, and 20% are displaced amacrine cells.
The calretinin positive ganglion cells made up on average 12% of the total
ganglion cell population outside of the foveal region and their proportion
increased with eccentricity. Prelabeling with antibodies against calretinin and
subsequent intracellular injection with DiI revealed that the large majority of
the injected cells (n = 74) were either narrow thorny or broad thorny ganglion
cells, 14 cells were displaced amacrine cells. Narrow thorny cells were further
distinguished into outer and inner stratifying cells. In addition, weakly labeled
cells with a large soma were identified as parasol ganglion cells. Our results
show that three types of thorny ganglion cells in marmoset retina can be
identified with antibodies against calretinin. Our findings are also consistent
with the idea that the proportion of wide-field ganglion cell types increases in 
peripheral retina.

Repetitive DNAs are abundant fast-evolving components of eukaryotic genomes,
which often possess important structural and functional roles. Despite their
ubiquity, repetitive DNAs are poorly studied when compared with the genic
fraction of genomes. Here, we took advantage of the availability of the sequenced
genome of the common marmoset Callithrix jacchus to assess its satellite DNAs
(satDNAs) and their distribution in Callitrichini. After clustering analysis of
all reads and comparisons by similarity, we identified a satDNA composed by
171 bp motifs, named MarmoSAT, which composes 1.09% of the C. jacchus genome.
Fluorescent in situ hybridization on chromosomes of species from the genera
Callithrix, Mico and Callimico showed that MarmoSAT had a subtelomeric location. 
In addition to the common monomeric, we found that MarmoSAT was also organized in
higher-order repeats of 338 bp in Callimico goeldii. Our phylogenetic analyses
showed that MarmoSAT repeats from C. jacchus lack chromosome-specific features,
suggesting exchange events among subterminal regions of non-homologous
chromosomes. MarmoSAT is transcribed in several tissues of C. jacchus, with the
highest transcription levels in spleen, thymus and heart. The transcription
profile and subtelomeric location suggest that MarmoSAT may be involved in the
regulation of telomerase and modulation of telomeric chromatin.

Fused in sarcoma (FUS) is an RNA binding protein that is involved in
frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).
To establish the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) as a model for FTLD, we
generated a stereotaxic injection-based marmoset model of FUS-silencing. We
designed shRNAs against the marmoset FUS gene and generated an AAV9 virus
encoding the most effective shRNA against FUS (shFUS). The AAV encoding shFUS
(AAV-shFUS) was introduced into the frontal cortex of young adult marmosets,
whereas AAV encoding a control shRNA was injected into the contralateral side. We
obtained approximately 70-80% silencing of FUS following AAV-shFUS injection.
Interestingly, FUS-silencing provoked a proliferation of astrocytes and
microglias. Since FTLD is characterized by various emotional deficits, it would
be helpful to establish a marmoset model of FUS-silencing in various brain
tissues for investigating the pathomechanism of higher cognitive and behavioral
dysfunction.

The provision of adequate space for laboratory animals is essential not only for 
good welfare but accurate studies. For example, housing conditions for primates
used in biomedical research may negatively affect welfare and thus the
reliability of findings. In common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus), an appropriate
cage size enables a socially harmonious family environment and optimizes
reproductive potential. In this study, we investigated the effects of cage size
on body weight (BW), behavior, and nursing succession in the common marmoset.
Large cages (LCs) with environment enrichment led to an increase in BW while
small cages (SCs) caused stereotypic behaviors that were not observed in LCs. In 
addition, the BW of infants increased with aging in LCs. Our findings indicate
that the welfare of marmosets was enhanced by living in LCs. Research on
non-human primates is essential for understanding the human brain and developing 
knowledge-based strategies for the diagnosis and treatment of psychiatric and
neurological disorders. Thus, the present findings are important because they
indicate that different cages may influence emotional and behavioral phenotypes.

Overcoming barriers to reprogramming and differentiation in nonhuman primate
induced pluripotent stem cells.

Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells) generated by cellular reprogramming
from nonhuman primates (NHPs) are of great significance for regenerative medicine
and for comparative biology. Autologously derived stem cells would theoretically 
avoid any risk of rejection due to host-donor mismatch and may bypass the need
for immune suppression post-transplant. In order for these possibilities to be
realized, reprogramming methodologies that were initially developed mainly for
human cells must be translated to NHPs. NHP studies have typically used
pluripotent cells generated from young animals and thus risk overlooking
complications that may arise from generating iPS cells from donors of other ages.
When reprogramming is extended to a wide range of NHP species, available donors
may be middle- or old-aged. Here we have pursued these questions by generating
iPS cells from donors across the life span of the common marmoset (Callithrix
jacchus) and then subjecting them to a directed neural differentiation protocol. 
The differentiation potential of different clonal cell lines was assessed using
the quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The results show that cells derived
from older donors often showed less neural marker induction. These deficits were 
rescued by a 24 h pretreatment of the cells with 0.5 % dimethyl sulfoxide.
Another NHP that plays a key role in biological research is the chimpanzee (Pan
troglodytes). iPS cells generated from the chimpanzee can be of great interest in
comparative in vitro studies. We investigated if similar deficits in
differentiation potential might arise in chimpanzee iPS cells reprogrammed using 
various technologies. The results show that, while some deficits were observed in
iPS cell clones generated using three different technologies, there was no clear 
association with the vector used. These deficits in differentiation were also
prevented by a 24 h pretreatment with 0.5 % dimethyl sulfoxide.

BACKGROUND: The visual system in primates can be segregated into motion and shape
pathways. Interaction occurs at multiple stages along these pathways. Processing 
of shape-from-motion and biological motion is considered to be a higher-order
integration process involving motion and shape information. However, relatively
limited types of stimuli have been used in previous studies on these integration 
processes.
NEW METHOD: We propose a new algorithm to extract object motion information from 
natural movies and to move random dots in accordance with the information. The
object motion information is extracted by estimating the dynamics of local normal
vectors of the image intensity projected onto the x-y plane of the movie.
RESULTS: An electrophysiological experiment on two adult common marmoset monkeys 
(Callithrix jacchus) showed that the natural and random dot movies generated with
this new algorithm yielded comparable neural responses in the middle temporal
visual area.
COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: In principle, this algorithm provided random
dot motion stimuli containing shape information for arbitrary natural movies.
This new method is expected to expand the neurophysiological and psychophysical
experimental protocols to elucidate the integration processing of motion and
shape information in biological systems.
CONCLUSIONS: The novel algorithm proposed here was effective in extracting object
motion information from natural movies and provided new motion stimuli to
investigate higher-order motion information processing.

LY-354,740 (eglumegad) is a selective and potent agonist of the metabotropic
glutamate group II receptors (mGluR2,3) that has already entered clinical trials 
as a potential anti-psychotic agent and therefore has well-documented
pharmacokinetic (PK), safety and tolerability profiles in human. Whereas its
development as an anti-psychotic agent has not been pursued, LY-354,740 may have 
potential in other neuroscience-related fields, notably anxiety and
neuro-protection. The common marmoset is a small primate that has long been used 
in neuroscience. However, given its small size and small circulating blood
volume, conducting PK studies to determine the therapeutic effectiveness of
LY-354,740 at clinically-relevant doses is challenging. Here, we have developed
and validated a simple, sensitive and selective analytical method that enables
quantification of LY-354,740 using a small volume of plasma. The analytical
method consisted of protein precipitation followed by high-performance liquid
chromatography with heat assisted electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry
(UHPLC-HESI-MS/MS). The chromatographic separation was achieved using gradient
elution with a mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile and 10mM ammonium formate 
(pH 3) on a Thermo Scientific Acclaim Trinity P1 analytical column (100x3.0mm
I.D., 3μm) operating at 45°C and at a flow rate of 900μl/min. The method displays
a linear relationship ranging from 20.0 to 5000ng/ml. Intra- and inter-day
relative standard deviations are less than 5.7% and 7.0%, respectively and the
accuracy ranged from 91.0 to 106.0%. The UHPLC-HESI-MS/MS analytical method we
describe here is simple, sensitive, specific and capable of quantifying
LY-354,740 in both rat and marmoset plasma, and is suitable to conduct PK studies
after a single sub-cutaneous dose of 1.0mg/kg or lower in both species.

KEY POINTS: The cortical mechanisms of grasping have been extensively studied in 
macaques and humans; here, we investigated whether common marmosets could rely on
similar mechanisms despite strong differences in hand morphology and grip
diversity. We recorded electrocorticographic activity over the sensorimotor
cortex of two common marmosets during the execution of different grip types,
which allowed us to study cortical activity (power spectrum) and physiologically 
inferred connectivity (phase-slope index). Analyses were performed in beta
(16-35 Hz) and gamma (75-100 Hz) frequency bands and our results showed that beta
power varied depending on grip type, whereas gamma power displayed clear
epoch-related modulation. Strength and direction of inter-area connectivity
varied depending on grip type and epoch. These findings suggest that fundamental 
control mechanisms are conserved across primates and, in future research,
marmosets could represent an adequate model to investigate primate brain
mechanisms.
ABSTRACT: The cortical mechanisms of grasping have been extensively studied in
macaques and humans. Here, we investigated whether common marmosets could rely on
similar mechanisms despite striking differences in manual dexterity. Two common
marmosets were trained to grasp-and-pull three objects eliciting different hand
configurations: whole-hand, finger and scissor grips. The animals were then
chronically implanted with 64-channel electrocorticogram arrays positioned over
the left premotor, primary motor and somatosensory cortex. Power spectra,
reflecting predominantly cortical activity, and phase-slope index, reflecting the
direction of information flux, were studied in beta (16-35 Hz) and gamma
(75-100 Hz) bands. Differences related to grip type, epoch (reach, grasp) and
cortical area were statistically assessed. Results showed that whole-hand and
scissor grips triggered stronger beta desynchronization than finger grip. Task
epochs clearly modulated gamma power, especially for finger and scissor grips.
Considering effective connectivity, finger and scissor grips evoked stronger
outflow from primary motor to premotor cortex, whereas whole-hand grip displayed 
the opposite pattern. These findings suggest that fundamental control mechanisms,
relying on adjustments of cortical activity and connectivity, are conserved
across primates. Consistently, marmosets could represent a good model to
investigate primate brain mechanisms.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is an increasingly popular non-human
primate species for developing transgenic and genomic edited models of
neurological disorders. These models present an opportunity to assess from birth 
the impact of genetic mutations and to identify candidate predictive biomarkers
of early disease onset. In order to apply findings from marmosets to humans, a
cross-species comparison of typical development is essential. Aiming to identify 
similarities, differences, and gaps in knowledge of neurodevelopment, we
evaluated peer-reviewed literature focused on the first 6 months of life of
marmosets and compared to humans. Five major developmental constructs, including 
reflexes and reactions, motor, feeding, self-help, and social, were compared.
Numerous similarities were identified in the developmental sequences with
differences often influenced by the purpose of the behavior, specifically for
marmoset survival. The lack of detailed knowledge of marmoset development was
exposed as related to the vast resources for humans.

1. Common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) are potentially useful nonhuman primate 
models for preclinical drug metabolism studies. However, the roles of marmoset
cytochrome P450 (P450) isoforms in the oxidation of endobiotic progesterone have 
not been fully investigated. In this study, the roles of marmoset P450 isoforms
in progesterone hydroxylation were extensively determined. 2. The activities of
liver microsomes from individual marmosets with respect to progesterone 21/17α-
and 16α/6β-hydroxylation were significantly correlated with those for
flurbiprofen 4-hydroxylation and midazolam 1'-hydroxylation, respectively, as
similar correlations have been found in humans. Anti-P450 2 C and 3 A antibodies 
suppressed progesterone 21/17α- and 16α/6β-hydroxylation, respectively, in
marmoset liver microsomes. 3. Recombinant marmoset P450 2C58 and 2C19 catalyzed
progesterone to form 21-hydroxyprogesterone and 16α-hydroxyprogesterone,
respectively, as major products with high maximum velocity/Km values of 0.53 and 
0.089 mL/min/nmol, respectively. Recombinant marmoset P450 3A4/90 oxidized
progesterone to form 6β-hydroxyprogesterone as a major product with homotropic
cooperativity (>1 of Hill coefficients). 4. These results indicate that the
overall activities and roles of liver microsomal P450 enzymes in marmoset livers 
are similar to those in humans, especially for progesterone 21/17α- and
16α/6β-hydroxylation by marmoset P450 2 C and 3 A enzymes, respectively,
suggesting important roles for these P450 enzymes in the metabolism of
endobiotics in marmosets.

Stroke is a common and devastating disease worldwide. Over the last two decades, 
many therapeutic approaches to ameliorate ischaemic stroke have been promising in
animal studies but failed when transferred to the clinical situation. One of the 
possible explanations for these failures is the widespread use of animal models
of cerebral ischemia that do not mimic the pathology encountered in the clinic.
Accordingly, many expert committees recommended the integration of higher order
species such as non-human primates in pre-clinical stroke studies. The common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a small New World monkey, start to stand out in
the neuroscience field as a good compromise between larger primates and rodents. 
In this review, we discuss the relevance of the use of the marmoset in stroke
studies. We will focus on behavioural tests developed in this species to assess
sensorimotor deficits and their recovery during acute and chronic stages of brain
ischaemia. The aim of this appraisal is to provide a comprehensive overview of
the existing approaches to induce stroke in the marmoset as well as the paradigms
for behavioural testing in this species. The data summarized in this review
should contribute to the improvement of future stoke studies in the marmoset and 
accordingly improve the translation of the results from bench to bed.

Tyrosinase is a copper-containing enzyme that regulates melanin biosynthesis and 
is encoded by the tyrosinase (TYR) gene. Previous studies demonstrated that
mutations in TYR could lead to oculocutaneous albinism type 1 (OCA1) owing to the
failure of melanin formation. Although a previous study found that albinism in
the rhesus monkey was derived from a mutation in TYR, the identification and
characterization of this gene in non-human primates has not been achieved thus
far. Thus, using the rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) and internal reverse
transcription PCR (RT-PCR) we identified the full-length sequence of TYR in the
crab-eating macaque, and two different transcript variants (TYR_1 and TYR_2).
While TYR_1 comprised five exons and its coding sequence was highly similar to
that of humans, TYR_2 comprised four exons and was generated by a
third-exon-skipping event. Interestingly, these two transcripts were also present
in the African green monkey (Old World monkey) and the common marmoset (New World
monkey). Deduced amino acid sequence analyses revealed that TYR_2 had a shorter
C-terminal region than TYR_1 owing to the exon-skipping event. Thus, the present 
study is the first to identify and characterize a full-length TYR gene in a
non-human primate, while the further validation of the third-exon-skipping in TYR
indicates that this event is well conserved in the primate lineage. Therefore,
this study provides useful and important information for the study of albinism
using non-human primate models.

There has been, and continues to be, a dramatic shift in the human population
towards older ages necessitating biomedical research aimed at better
understanding the basic biology of aging and age-related diseases and
facilitating new and improved therapeutic options. As it is not practical to
perform the breadth of this research in humans, animal models are necessary to
recapitulate the complexity of the aging environment. The mouse model is most
frequently chosen for these endeavors, however, they are frequently not the most 
appropriate model. Non-human primates, on the other hand, are more closely
related to humans and recapitulate the human aging process and development of
age-related diseases. Extensive aging research has been performed in the
well-characterized rhesus macaque aging model. More recently, the common
marmoset, a small non-human primate with a shorter lifespan, has been explored as
a potential aging model. This model holds particular promise as an aging disease 
model in part due to the successful creation of transgenic marmosets. Limitations
to the use of non-human primates in aging research exist but can be mitigated
somewhat by the existence of available resources supported by the National
Institutes of Health. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Animal
models of aging - edited by "Houtkooper Riekelt".

The common marmoset has recently gained a great deal of attention as an
experimental primate model for biological science and medical research. To use
the common marmoset for development of novel treatments and rehabilitation for
locomotor disorders, it is crucial to understand fundamental baseline
characteristics of locomotion in this species. Therefore, in the present study we
performed kinematic and kinetic analyses of quadrupedal locomotion in this
animal. A total of 14 common marmosets walking quadrupedally along a walkway were
analyzed using synchronized high-speed cameras, with two force platforms set in
the walkway. Our results demonstrated that the marmoset uses a lateral sequence
walking pattern, in contrast to the macaque and other primates, which usually
adopt a diagonal sequence pattern. Furthermore, peak vertical ground reaction
force on the forelimb was larger than that on the hindlimb. The rate of energy
recovery for quadrupedal walking in the common marmoset was much smaller than
that in the macaque, indicating that the marmoset generally utilizes bouncing
mechanics in locomotion, even though the duty factor is >0.5. This description of
locomotor characteristics of intact marmosets may serve as a basis for
comparative analyses of changes in gait due to rehabilitation and regenerative
treatments.

Head turning experiments are widely used to test the cognition of both human
infants and non-human animal species. Monitoring head turns allows researchers to
non-invasively assess attention to acoustic or visual stimuli. In the majority of
head turning experiments, the head direction analyses have been accomplished
manually, which is extremely labor intensive and can be affected by subjectivity 
or other human errors and limitations. In the current study, we introduce an
open-source computer program for measuring head directions of freely moving
animals including common marmoset monkeys (Callithrix jacchus), American
alligators (Alligator mississippiensis), and Mongolian gerbils (Meriones
unguiculatus) to reduce human effort and time in video coding. We also illustrate
an exemplary framework for an animal head turning experiment with common marmoset
monkeys. This framework incorporates computer-aided processes of data
acquisition, preprocessing, and analysis using the aforementioned software and
additional open-source software and hardware.

1. A potentially useful animal model for preclinical studies is the common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). In this study, using reverse-transcription
polymerase chain reaction from marmoset livers, we identified a novel cytochrome 
P450 (P450) 2F1 cDNA with an open reading frame of 1473 bp. 2. High sequence
identities of 92-94% with primate P450 2 F amino acid sequences were indicated by
deduced amino acid sequences of P450 2F1 cDNA. Phylogenetic analysis indicates
that marmoset P450 2F1 is more congruent with primate P450 2 F forms than those
of other species such as rodents. 3. Among five tissue types examined, abundant
expression of marmoset P450 2F1 mRNA and P450 2F1 protein in lungs was shown.
Cynomolgus monkey P450 2F1 mRNA was abundantly expressed in lungs as well as
testes and ovaries in 10 tissue types. 4. Similar to those of humans and
cynomolgus monkeys, marmoset P450 2F1 heterologously expressed in Escherichia
coli membranes efficiently catalyzed 7-ethoxycoumarin O-deethylation and biphenyl
hydroxylation, however unlike human P450 2F1, marmoset P450 2F1 exhibited
hydroxylation activity toward coumarin and chlorzoxazone. 5. These findings
indicated that P450 2F1 enzyme expressed in marmoset lungs and also catalyzed
metabolism of xenobiotics, suggesting the importance of P450 2 F-dependent drug
metabolism in marmoset lungs.

The aim of this study was to provide a detailed anatomical description of the
abdomen in the clinically normal common marmoset by means of computed tomography 
(CT). Eight clinically healthy mature common marmosets ranging from 12 to
48 months and 235 to 365 g bodyweight were anesthetized and pre- and
post-contrast CT examinations were performed using different CT settings in
dorsal recumbency. Abdominal organs were identified and visibility noted.
Diagnostic quality abdominal images could be obtained of the common marmoset
despite its small size using a dual-slice CT scanner. Representative
cross-sectional images were chosen from different animals illustrating the
abdominal CT anatomy of clinically normal common marmosets. Identification or
delineation of abdominal organs greatly improved with i.v. contrast. A modified
high-frequency algorithm with edge enhancement added valuable information for
identification of small structures such as the ureters. The Hounsfield unit (HU) 
of major abdominal organs differed from that of small animals (domestic dogs and 
cats). Due to their size and different anatomy, standard small animal CT
protocols need to be critically assessed and adapted for exotics, such as the
common marmoset. The established normal reference range of HU of major abdominal 
organs and adapted settings for a CT protocol will aid clinical assessment of the
common marmoset.

The common marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus; Cj) is an advantageous nonhuman
primate species for modeling age-related disorders, including Parkinson's
disease, due to their shorter life span compared to macaques. Cj-derived induced 
pluripotent stem cells (Cj-iPSCs) from somatic cells are needed for in vitro
disease modeling and testing regenerative medicine approaches. Here we report the
development of a novel Cj-iPSC line derived from adult marmoset fibroblasts. The 
Cj-iPSCs showed potent pluripotency properties, including the development of
mesodermal lineages in tumors after injection to immunocompromised mice, as well 
as ectoderm and endoderm lineages after in vitro differentiation regimens,
demonstrating differentiated derivatives of all three embryonic layers. In
addition, expression of key pluripotency genes (ZFP42, PODXL, DNMT3B, C-MYC,
LIN28, KLF4, NANOG, SOX2, and OCT4) was observed. We then tested the neural
differentiation capacity and gene expression profiles of Cj-iPSCs and a marmoset 
embryonic stem cell line (Cj-ESC) after dual-SMAD inhibition. Exposure to
CHIR99021 and sonic hedgehog (SHH) for 12 and 16 days, respectively, patterned
the cells toward a ventralized midbrain dopaminergic phenotype, confirmed by
expression of FOXA2, OTX2, EN-1, and tyrosine hydroxylase. These results
demonstrate that common marmoset stem cells will be able to serve as a platform
for investigating regenerative medicine approaches targeting the dopaminergic
system.

Among mammals, alloparental care can be influenced by hormones as well as by
previous experience and sensory stimuli from the infants, such as sight and
sound, smell, and physical contact with the infant. To determine the
responsiveness of common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) nonreproductive females
and males with and without previous experience in caretaking to infant sensory
cues, we exposed 12 females and 12 males to vocalization recordings for 10 min
under two conditions: (1) exposure to adult conspecific vocalization recordings, 
and (2) exposure to infant vocalization recordings. We recorded the frequency of 
approach toward the sound source, the time spent near it and locomotion frequency
of males and females in the cage under both conditions. Blood samples were
collected after each test for cortisol measuring by EIA method. The infant
vocalization affects the behavioral and hormonal responses of males and females
of common marmosets. The animals approached and spent more time near the sound
source and showed an increase in locomotion during infant vocalization exposure
compared to the adult vocalization. However, there was no significant difference 
in the behavioral response of animals when previous experience and the sex were
taken into account. In both sexes, cortisol levels were significantly higher
following infant vocalization exposure compared to the adult vocalization. These 
findings suggest that the infant vocalization appears to be an effective cue that
facilitates the approach of the caregiver and maintaining their responsiveness
and that the cortisol seems to be important for alertness to sensory stimuli,
modulating their motivation to interact with the infant.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a small New World primate that is
becoming increasingly popular in the neurosciences as an animal model of
preclinical human disease. With several major disorders characterized by
alterations in neural white matter (e.g., multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's
disease, schizophrenia), proposed to be transgenically modeled using marmosets,
the ability to isolate and characterize reliably major white matter fiber tracts 
with MRI will be of use for evaluating structural brain changes related to
disease processes and symptomatology. Here, we propose protocols for isolating
major white matter fiber tracts in the common marmoset using in vivo
ultrahigh-field MRI (9.4T) diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) data. With the use of
a high angular-resolution DWI (256 diffusion-encoding directions) sequence,
collected on four anesthetized marmosets, we provide guidelines for manually
drawing fiber-tracking regions of interest, based on easily identified anatomical
landmarks in DWI native space. These fiber-tract isolation protocols are expected
to be experimentally useful for visualization and quantification of individual
white matter fiber tracts in both control and experimental groups of marmosets
(e.g., transgenic models). As disease models in the marmoset advance, the
determination of how macroscopic white matter anatomy is altered as a function of
disease state will be relevant in bridging the existing translational gap between
preclinical rodent models and human patients.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Although
significant progress has been made in mapping white matter connections in the
marmoset brain using ex vivo tracing techniques, the application of in vivo
virtual dissection of major white matter fiber tracts has been established by few
studies in the marmoset literature. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of
whole-brain diffusion-weighted tractography in anesthetized marmosets at
ultrahigh-field MRI (9.4T) and propose protocols for isolating nine major white
matter fiber tracts in the marmoset brain.

Nonhuman primates provide an important model not only for understanding human
brain but also for translational research in neurological and psychiatric
disorders. However, many high-resolution techniques for recording neural activity
in vivo that were initially established for rodents have not been yet applied to 
the nonhuman primate brain. Here, we introduce a combination of two-photon
targeted patching and dendritic Ca2+ imaging to the neocortex of adult common
marmoset, an invaluable primate model for neuroscience research. Using targeted
patching, we show both spontaneous and sensory-evoked intracellular dynamics of
visually identified neurons in the marmoset cortex. Using two-photon Ca2+ imaging
and intracellular pharmacological manipulation, we report both
action-potential-associated global and synaptically-evoked NMDA
(N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor-mediated local Ca2+ signals in dendrites and
spines of the superficial-layer cortical neurons. Therefore, we demonstrate the
presence of synaptic Ca2+ signals in neuronal dendrites in living nonhuman
primates. This work represents a proof-of-principle for exploring the primate
brain functions in vivo by monitoring neural activity and morphology at a
subcellular resolution.

BACKGROUND: The brain of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is becoming a
popular non-human primate model in neuroscience research. Because its brain fiber
connectivity is still poorly understood, it is necessary to collect and present
connection and trajectory data using tracers to establish a marmoset brain
connectivity database.
NEW METHOD: To visualize projections and trajectories of axons, brain section
images were reconstructed in 3D by registering them to the corresponding
block-face brain images taken during brain sectioning. During preprocessing,
autofluorescence of the tissue was reduced by applying independent component
analysis to a set of fluorescent images taken using different filters.
RESULTS: The method was applied to a marmoset dataset after a tracer had been
injected into an auditory belt area to fluorescently label axonal projections.
Cortical and subcortical connections were clearly reconstructed in 3D. The
registration error was estimated to be smaller than 200 μm. Evaluation tests on
ICA-based autofluorescence reduction showed a significant improvement in signal
and background separation.
COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: Regarding the 3D reconstruction error, the
present study shows an accuracy comparable to previous studies using MRI and
block-face images. Compared to serial section two-photon tomography, an advantage
of the proposed method is that it can be combined with standard histological
techniques. The images of differently processed brain sections can be integrated 
into the original ex vivo brain shape.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed method allows creating 3D axonal projection maps
overlaid with brain area annotations based on the histological staining results
of the same animal.

BACKGROUND: The common marmoset has been used as an experimental animal for
various purposes. Because its average weight ranges from 250 to 500 g, weight
loss quickly becomes critical for sick animals. Therefore, effective and
non-stressful treatment for chronic diseases, including diarrhoea, is essential.
CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case in which faecal microbiota transplantation
(FMT) led to immediate recovery from chronic and recurrent diarrhoea caused by
Clostridium difficile infection. A male common marmoset experienced chronic
diarrhoea after antibiotic treatments. The animal experienced severe weight loss,
and a faecal sample was confirmed to be C. difficile-positive but was negative
for protozoa. Metronidazole was partially effective at the first administration
but not after the recurrence of the clinical signs. Then, oral FMT was
administered to the subject by feeding fresh faeces from healthy individuals
mixed with the marmoset's usual food. We monitored the faeces by categorization
into four groups: normal, loose, diarrhoea, and watery. After the first day of
FMT treatment, the marmoset underwent a remarkable recovery from diarrhoea, and
after the fourth day of treatment, a test for C. difficile was negative. The
clinical signs did not recur. The marmoset recovered from sinusitis and bilateral
dacryocystitis, which also did not recur, as a by-product of the improvement in
its general health caused by the cessation of diarrhoea after the FMT.
CONCLUSION: This is the first reported case of successful treatment of a marmoset
using oral FMT. As seen in human patients, FMT was effective for the treatment of
recurrent C. difficile infection in a captive marmoset.

Oxidative damage and iron redistribution are associated with the pathogenesis and
progression of multiple sclerosis (MS), but these aspects are not entirely
replicated in rodent experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) models.
Here, we report that oxidative burst and injury as well as redistribution of iron
are hallmarks of the MS-like pathology in the EAE model in the common marmoset.
Active lesions in the marmoset EAE brain display increased expression of
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (p22phox, p47phox,
and gp91phox) and inducible nitric oxide synthase immunoreactivity within lesions
with active inflammation and demyelination, coinciding with enhanced expression
of mitochondrial heat-shock protein 70 and superoxide dismutase 1 and 2. The EAE 
lesion-associated liberation of iron (due to loss of iron-containing myelin) was 
associated with altered expression of the iron metabolic markers FtH1,
lactoferrin, hephaestin, and ceruloplasmin. The enhanced expression of oxidative 
damage markers in inflammatory lesions indicates that the enhanced antioxidant
enzyme expression could not counteract reactive oxygen and nitrogen
species-induced cellular damage, as is also observed in MS brains. This study
demonstrates that oxidative injury and aberrant iron distribution are prominent
pathological hallmarks of marmoset EAE thus making this model suitable for
therapeutic intervention studies aimed at reducing oxidative stress and
associated iron dysmetabolism.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is an increasingly popular animal model 
for translational neuroscience studies, during which anatomical and functional
MRI can be useful investigative tools. To attain the requisite SNR for
high-resolution acquisitions, the radiofrequency coil must be optimized for the
marmoset; however, relatively few custom coils have been developed that maximize 
SNR and are compatible with accelerated acquisitions. For the study of large
populations of animals, the heterogeneity in animal size reduces the
effectiveness of a "one size fits all" approach to coil sizing and makes coils
tailored to individual animals cost and time prohibitive. The approach taken in
this study was to create an 8-channel phased-array receive coil that was
adjustable to the width of the marmoset head, thereby negating the need for
tailored coils while still maintaining high SNR. Two marmosets of different size 
were imaged on a 9.4-T small-animal scanner. Consistent SNR was achieved in the
periphery of the brain between head sizes. When compared to a 15-channel, "one
size fits all" receive coil, the adjustable coil achieved 57% higher SNR in the
superior frontal and parietal cortices and 29% higher SNR in the centre of the
brain. The mean geometry factor of the adjustable coil was less than 1.2 for a
2-fold reduction factor in the left-right and anterior-posterior directions.
Geometry factors were compared to the 15-channel coil to guide future designs.
The adjustable coil was shown to be a practical means for anatomical and
echo-planar imaging of marmoset cohorts.

The common marmoset, Callithrix jacchus, is a small New World monkey that has
recently gained attention as an important experimental animal model in the field 
of neuroscience as well in rehabilitative and regenerative medicine. This
attention reflects the closer phylogenetic relationship between humans and common
marmosets compared to that between humans and other experimental animals. When
studying the neuronal mechanism behind various types of neurological motor
disorders using the common marmoset, possible differences in muscle parameters
(e.g., the force-generating capacity of each of the muscles) between the common
marmoset and other animals must be taken into account to permit accurate
interpretation of observed motor behavior. Differences in the muscle
architectural properties are expected to affect biomechanics, and hence to affect
neuronal control of body movements. Therefore, we dissected the forelimbs and
hind limbs of two common marmosets, including systematic analysis of the muscle
mass, fascicle length, and physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA). Comparisons
of the mass fractions and PCSA fractions of the forelimb and hind limb
musculature among the common marmoset, human, Japanese macaque, and domestic cat 
demonstrated that the overall muscle architectural properties of the forelimbs
and hind limbs in the common marmoset are very similar to those of the Japanese
macaque, a typical quadrupedal primate. However, muscle architectural properties 
of the common marmoset differ from those of the domestic cat, which has
relatively larger hamstrings and pedal digital flexor muscles. Compared to
humans, the common marmoset exhibits relatively smaller shoulder protractor,
retractor, and abductor muscles and larger elbow extensor and rotator-cuff
muscles in the forelimb, and smaller plantarflexor muscles in the hind limb.
These differences in the muscle architectural properties must be taken into
account when interpreting motor behaviors such as locomotion and arm-reaching
movements in the common marmoset.

Common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) have attracted increasing attention as a
useful small non-human primate model in preclinical research. However, studies on
marmoset cytochrome P450 (P450) 2E enzyme have scarcely been conducted. In this
study, the full-length cDNA encoding P450 2E1 enzyme was isolated from marmoset
livers by reverse transcription (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Marmoset
P450 2E1 amino acid sequences were highly identical (>88%) to those of cynomolgus
monkey and human P450 2E1 enzymes. Phylogenetic analysis indicated a close
evolutionary relationship among marmoset, cynomolgus monkey, and human P450 2E1
enzymes. The tissue expression pattern analyzed by real-time RT-PCR and
immunoblotting demonstrated that marmoset P450 2E1 mRNA and proteins were
predominantly expressed in livers. Marmoset P450 2E1 enzyme heterologously
expressed in Escherichia coli catalyzed the hydroxylation of p-nitrophenol,
chlorzoxazone, and theophylline, similar to cynomolgus monkey and human P450 2E1 
enzymes. By kinetic analyses, those P450 2E1 enzymes catalyzed p-nitrophenol
hydroxylation with similar affinities and relatively high intrinsic clearance
efficiencies. These results indicated that tissue distribution and
enzyme-substrate specificity of marmoset P450 2E1 were similar to cynomolgus
monkey and human P450 2E1 enzymes, suggesting that marmosets are a suitable
primate model for P450 2E1-dependent drug and xenobiotic metabolism.

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection in humans is
highly lethal, with a fatality rate of 35%. New prophylactic and therapeutic
strategies to combat human infections are urgently needed. We isolated a fully
human neutralizing antibody, MCA1, from a human survivor. The antibody recognizes
the receptor-binding domain of MERS-CoV S glycoprotein and interferes with the
interaction between viral S and the human cellular receptor human dipeptidyl
peptidase 4 (DPP4). To our knowledge, this study is the first to report a human
neutralizing monoclonal antibody that completely inhibits MERS-CoV replication in
common marmosets. Monotherapy with MCA1 represents a potential alternative
treatment for human infections with MERS-CoV worthy of evaluation in clinical
settings.

To safeguard patients, regulatory authorities require that new drugs that are to 
be given by the intravitreal (IVT) route are assessed for their safety in a
laboratory species using the same route of administration. Due to the high
similarity of ocular morphology and physiology between humans and nonhuman
primates (NHPs) and due to the species specificity of many biotherapeutics, the
monkey is often the only appropriate model. To this end, intravitreal
administration and assessment of ocular toxicity are well established in
cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis). In contrast, the common marmoset monkey
(Callithrix jacchus) is not a standard model for ocular toxicity studies due to
its general sensitivity to laboratory investigations and small eye size. It was
the purpose of the present work to study whether the marmoset is a useful
alternative to the cynomolgus monkey for use in intravitreal toxicological
studies. Six marmoset monkeys received repeated (every 2 weeks for a total of
four doses) intravitreal injections of 10 or 20  µ L of a placebo. The animals
were assessed for measurements of intraocular pressure (IOP), standard
ophthalmological investigations and electroretinography (ERG). At the end of the 
dosing period, the animals were sacrificed and the eyes were evaluated
histologically. ERG revealed similar results when comparing predose to
end-of-study data, and there was no difference between the two dose volumes. A
transient increase in the IOP was seen immediately after dosing, which was more
pronounced after dosing of 20  µ L compared to 10  µ L. Ophthalmologic and
microscopic observations did not show any significant changes. Therefore, it can 
be concluded that 10  µ L as well as 20  µ L intravitreal injections of a placebo
are well tolerated in the marmoset. These results demonstrate that the common
marmoset is an alternative to the cynomolgus monkey for intravitreal toxicity
testing.

BACKGROUND: Due to a sporadic occurrence of Mycobacterium avium subsp.
paratuberculosis (MAP) in non-human primates (NHP), the susceptibility of
different NHP to MAP should be investigated.
METHODS: Fecal and tissue samples (ileum, ileocecal lymph node, bone marrow) of
20 animals (seven species) were analyzed by IS900-based PCRs and sequenced.
Samples of MAP PCR positive NHP were further cultivated.
RESULTS: MAP DNA was detectable in two animals; the ileum of a cottontop tamarin 
and the bone marrow of a common marmoset. Cultivation of MAP failed. Sequence
analysis revealed 100% homology to the MAP-K10 sequence. Pathohistological
examinations offered no direct correlation to a MAP infection.
CONCLUSIONS: MAP was detected for the first time in a common marmoset. But as
both NHP suffered from other diseases, an asymptomatic infection with MAP was
assumed. The detection of MAP in the bone marrow might play a role in
establishing latent paratuberculosis, as known from tuberculosis.

Slow loris (Nycticebus spp.) captive diets have been based on routine and
anecdotes rather than scientific fact. The growing body of evidence contradicts
the high fruit diet supported by such anecdotes. Non-human primate nutrient
requirements are grouped into new (based on the common marmoset Callithrix
jacchus) or old world (based on rhesus macaques Macaca mulatta) primates. Slow
lorises are known to suffer from many health ailments in captivity such as dental
disease, obesity, wasting and kidney issues all of which have been linked to
diet. This study aimed to estimate nutrient intake from free-ranging slow lorises
and to determine whether this intake can be used as nutrient recommendations. We 
collected data of nutrient intake, food passage rate and digestibility of captive
slow lorises on three diet treatments 1: current captive type diet which is
mostly fruits, 2: wild-type diet made only of food items from their natural diet,
3: new diet made to reflect wild slow loris nutrient intake. In order to validate
our nutrient recommendations, diets 2 and 3 would have to be significantly
different to Diet 1 in terms of nutrients, but not different from each other.
Captive diets were significantly higher in soluble carbohydrates and lower in
minerals and fibre fractions than both diets 2 and 3. Diets 2 and 3 led to a
significantly increased food passage time and to more effective fibre and calcium
digestion compared to Diet 1. We also observed obese individuals lost weight and 
underweight individuals gained weight. Our nutrient recommendations have been
validated by our trials, and new or old world monkey nutrient recommendations are
not consistent with our results. Diets should be high in protein and fibre and
low in soluble carbohydrates and fats.

1. Roles of human cytochrome P450 (P450) 3A4 in oxidation of an antihistaminic
drug terfenadine have been previously investigated in association with
terfenadine-ketoconazole interaction. Several antihistamine drugs have been
recently identified as substrates for multiple P450 enzymes. In this study,
overall roles of P450 3A4, 2J2, and 4F12 enzymes in terfenadine t-butyl
hydroxylation were investigated in small intestines and livers from humans,
marmosets, and/or cynomolgus monkeys. 2. Human liver microsomes and liver and
small intestine microsomes from marmosets and cynomolgus monkeys effectively
mediated terfenadine t-butyl hydroxylation. Ketoconazole and
N-hydroxy-N'-(4-butyl-2-methylphenyl)-formamidine (a P450 4A/F inhibitor) almost 
completely and moderately inhibited these activities, respectively, in human
liver microsomes; however, these chemicals did not show substantially suppression
in marmoset liver. Anti-human P450 3A and 4F antibodies showed the roughly
supportive inhibitory effects. 3. Recombinant P450 3A4/90 and 4F12 showed high
terfenadine t-butyl hydroxylation activities with substrate inhibition constants 
of 84-144 μM (under 26-76 μM of Km values), in similar manners to liver and
intestine microsomes. 4. These results suggest that human and marmoset P450
3A4/90 and 4F12 in livers or small intestines played important roles in
terfenadine t-butyl hydroxylation. Marmosets could be a model for humans during
first pass extraction of terfenadine and related substrates.

BACKGROUND: The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) has been proposed as a
suitable bridge between rodents and larger primates. They have been used in
several types of research including auditory, vocal, visual, pharmacological and 
genetics studies. However, marmosets have not been used as much for behavioral
studies.
NEW METHOD: Here we present data from training 12 adult marmosets for behavioral 
neuroscience studies. We discuss the husbandry, food preferences, handling,
acclimation to laboratory environments and neurosurgical techniques. In this
paper, we also present a custom built "scoop" and a monkey chair suitable for
training of these animals.
RESULTS: The animals were trained for three tasks: 4 target center-out reaching
task, reaching tasks that involved controlling robot actions, and touch screen
task. All animals learned the center-out reaching task within 1-2 weeks whereas
learning reaching tasks controlling robot actions task took several months of
behavioral training where the monkeys learned to associate robot actions with
food rewards.
COMPARISON TO EXISTING METHOD: We propose the marmoset as a novel model for
behavioral neuroscience research as an alternate for larger primate models. This 
is due to the ease of handling, quick reproduction, available neuroanatomy,
sensorimotor system similar to larger primates and humans, and a lissencephalic
brain that can enable implantation of microelectrode arrays relatively easier at 
various cortical locations compared to larger primates.
CONCLUSION: All animals were able to learn behavioral tasks well and we present
the marmosets as an alternate model for simple behavioral neuroscience tasks.

Cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) continue to be
identified and with a lack of effective clinical treatment and no preventative
strategies, treatment using convalescent plasma or monoclonal antibodies (mAbs)
is a potential quick route to an intervention. Passive immunotherapy via either
convalescent plasma or mAbs has proven to be effective for other infectious
agents. Following infection with MERS-CoV, common marmosets were treated with
high titer hyperimmune plasma or the mAb m336, at 6 and 48 h post inoculation.
Both treatments reduced signs of clinical disease, but reduction in viral loads
in the respiratory tract were only found in the hyperimmune plasma group. A
decrease in gross pathology was found only in the mAb-treated group, but no
histological differences were observed between treated and control animals. While
both hyperimmune plasma and the m336 treatments reduced the severity of disease
in the common marmoset, neither treatment resulted in full protection against
disease.

Age-associated neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease,
Parkinson's disease, and the polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases, are becoming
prevalent as a consequence of elongation of the human lifespan. Although various 
rodent models have been developed to study and overcome these diseases, they have
limitations in their translational research utility owing to differences from
humans in brain structure and function and in drug metabolism. Here, we generated
a transgenic marmoset model of the polyQ diseases, showing progressive
neurological symptoms including motor impairment. Seven transgenic marmosets were
produced by lentiviral introduction of the human ataxin 3 gene with 120 CAG
repeats encoding an expanded polyQ stretch. Although all offspring showed no
neurological symptoms at birth, three marmosets with higher transgene expression 
developed neurological symptoms of varying degrees at 3-4 months after birth,
followed by gradual decreases in body weight gain, spontaneous activity, and grip
strength, indicating time-dependent disease progression. Pathological
examinations revealed neurodegeneration and intranuclear polyQ protein inclusions
accompanied by gliosis, which recapitulate the neuropathological features of
polyQ disease patients. Consistent with neuronal loss in the cerebellum, brain
MRI analyses in one living symptomatic marmoset detected enlargement of the
fourth ventricle, which suggests cerebellar atrophy. Notably, successful germline
transgene transmission was confirmed in the second-generation offspring derived
from the symptomatic transgenic marmoset gamete. Because the accumulation of
abnormal proteins is a shared pathomechanism among various neurodegenerative
diseases, we suggest that this new marmoset model will contribute toward
elucidating the pathomechanisms of and developing clinically applicable therapies
for neurodegenerative diseases.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is one of the smallest species of
primates, with high visual recognition abilities that allow them to judge the
identity and quality of food and objects in their environment. To address the
cortical processing of visual information related to material surface features in
marmosets, we presented a set of stimuli that have identical three-dimensional
shapes (bone, torus or amorphous) but different material appearances (ceramic,
glass, fur, leather, metal, stone, wood, or matte) to anesthetized marmoset, and 
recorded multiunit activities from an area ventral to the superior temporal
sulcus (STS) using multi-shanked, and depth resolved multi-electrode array. Out
of 143 visually responsive multiunits recorded from four animals, 29% had
significant main effect only of the material, 3% only of the shape and 43% of
both the material and the shape. Furthermore, we found neuronal cluster(s), in
which most cells: (1) showed a significant main effect in material appearance;
(2) the best stimulus was a glossy material (glass or metal); and (3) had reduced
response to the pixel-shuffled version of the glossy material images. The
location of the gloss-selective area was in agreement with previous macaque
studies, showing activation in the ventral bank of STS. Our results suggest that 
perception of gloss is an important ability preserved across wide range of
primate species.

Wasting marmoset syndrome (WMS) has high incidence and mortality rates and is one
of the most important problems in captive common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus)
colonies. Despite several reports on WMS, little information is available
regarding its reliable treatment. We previously reported that marmosets with WMS 
had high serum levels of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9). MMP9 is thought to be
a key enzyme in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease, the main disease 
state of WMS, and is activated by plasmin, a fibrinolytic factor. In a previous
study, treating mice with an antibody to inhibit plasmin prevented the
progression of inflammatory bowel disease. Here we examined the efficacy of
tranexamic acid, a commonly used plasmin inhibitor, for the treatment of WMS,
with supportive measures including amino acid and iron formulations. Six colony
marmosets with WMS received tranexamic acid therapy with supportive measures for 
8 wk. The body weight, Hct, and serum albumin levels of these 6 marmosets were
increased and serum MMP9 levels decreased after this regimen. Therefore,
tranexamic acid therapy may be a new and useful treatment for WMS.

Despite the importance of transition metals for normal brain function, relatively
little is known about the distribution of these elemental species across the
different tissue compartments of the primate brain. In this study, we employed
laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry on PFA-fixed brain
sections obtained from two adult common marmosets. Concurrent cytoarchitectonic, 
myeloarchitectonic, and chemoarchitectonic measurements allowed for
identification of the major neocortical, archaecortical, and subcortical
divisions of the brain, and precise localisation of iron, manganese, and zinc
concentrations within each division. Major findings across tissue compartments
included: (1) differentiation of white matter tracts from grey matter based on
manganese and zinc distribution; (2) high iron concentrations in the basal
ganglia, cortex, and substantia nigra; (3) co-localization of high concentrations
of iron and manganese in the primary sensory areas of the cerebral cortex; and
(4) high manganese in the hippocampus. The marmoset has become a model species of
choice for connectomic, aging, and transgenic studies in primates, and the
application of metallomics to these disciplines has the potential to yield high
translational and basic science value.

Data on spontaneous pathology are substantially scarce for common marmosets,
compared to other laboratory animals, but is essential for the interpretation of 
histological findings in the context of toxicological and experimental studies.
Especially if common marmosets are used as experimental animals in respiratory
research, detailed knowledge on the spectrum, occurrence, and incidence of
spontaneous histopathological pulmonary lesions in this non-human primate species
is required. In this study, lung tissue of 638 common marmosets from the marmoset
colony of the German Primate Center was examined histologically. The analysis
revealed a high incidence of predominantly mild and multifocal interstitial
pneumonia (32.99 %) of unknown etiology in most cases. Only few marmosets
exhibited lobar pneumonia (1.41 %) and bronchopneumonia (0.94), which were mainly
caused by bacterial pathogens such as Bordetella bronchiseptica and Klebsiella
pneumoniae. Lung immaturity and atelectasis were common histological findings in 
newborn marmosets. Typical background lesions included anthracosis (8.15 %),
hemosiderosis (1.72 %), extramedullary hematopoiesis (11.6 %), mineralization
(10.97 %), and inflammatory cell foci (10.34 %). In addition, three cases of
pulmonary arteriopathy (0.47 %) and 1 case of foreign-body granuloma (0.16 %)
were detected in the marmoset study cohort. The high prevalence of circulatory
disturbances (congestion, edema, hemorrhage) and changes in air content
(secondary atelectasis, alveolar emphysema) could partly be explained by
euthanasia-related artifacts or agonal changes. The present study provides a
comprehensive overview of the range and incidence of spontaneous pulmonary
histopathology in common marmosets, serving as valuable reference data for the
interpretation of lung lesions in toxicological and experimental marmoset
studies.

Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), which is caused by a newly discovered
coronavirus (CoV), has recently emerged. It causes severe viral pneumonia and is 
associated with a high fatality rate. However, the pathogenesis, comparative
pathology and inflammatory cell response of rhesus macaques and common marmosets 
experimentally infected with MERS-CoV are unknown. We describe the
histopathological, immunohistochemical, and ultrastructural findings from rhesus 
macaque and common marmoset animal models of MERS-CoV infection. The main
histopathological findings in the lungs of rhesus macaques and common marmosets
were varying degrees of pulmonary lesions, including pneumonia, pulmonary oedema,
haemorrhage, degeneration and necrosis of the pneumocytes and bronchial
epithelial cells, and inflammatory cell infiltration. The characteristic
inflammatory cells in the lungs of rhesus macaques and common marmosets were
eosinophils and neutrophils, respectively. Based on these observations, the lungs
of rhesus macaques and common marmosets appeared to develop chronic and acute
pneumonia, respectively. MERS-CoV antigens and viral RNA were identified in type 
I and II pneumocytes, alveolar macrophages and bronchial epithelial cells, and
ultrastructural observations showed that viral protein was found in type II
pneumocytes and inflammatory cells in both species. Correspondingly, the entry
receptor DDP4 was found in type I and II pneumocytes, bronchial epithelial cells,
and alveolar macrophages. The rhesus macaque and common marmoset animal models of
MERS-CoV can be used as a tool to mimic the oncome of MERS-CoV infections in
humans. These models can help to provide a better understanding of the pathogenic
process of this virus and to develop effective medications and prophylactic
treatments.

We examined the usefulness of commercially available DNA methylation arrays
designed for the human genome (Illumina HumanMethylation450 and MethylationEPIC) 
for high-throughput epigenome analysis of the common marmoset, a nonhuman primate
suitable for research on neuropsychiatric disorders. From among the probes on the
methylation arrays, we selected those available for the common marmoset. DNA
methylation data were obtained from genomic DNA extracted from the frontal cortex
and blood samples of adult common marmosets as well as the frontal cortex of
neonatal marmosets. About 10% of the probes on the arrays were estimated to be
useful for DNA methylation assay in the common marmoset. Strong correlations
existed between human and marmoset DNA methylation data. Illumina methylation
arrays are useful for epigenome research using the common marmoset.

Generation of nonhuman primate models of human disease conditions will foster the
development of novel therapeutic strategies. Callithrix jacchus, or the common
marmoset, is a New World, nonhuman primate species that exhibits great
reproductive fitness in captivity with an ovarian cycle that can be easily
managed with pharmacological agents. This characteristic, among others, provides 
an opportunity to employ assisted reproductive technologies to generate embryos
that can be genetically manipulated to create a variety of nonhuman primate
models for human disease. Here, we review methods to synchronize the marmoset
ovarian cycle and stimulate oocyte donors, and compare various protocols for in
vitro production of embryos. In light of advances in genomic editing, recent
approaches used to generate transgenic or genetically edited embryos in the
marmoset and also future perspective are reviewed.

To elucidate the forelimb phylogeny of primates, anatomical analysis of the
brachial plexus in platyrrhines is beneficial. In the present study, six brachial
plexuses and the surrounding arteries of four common marmosets were dissected. In
five specimens, the brachial plexus consisted of five ventral rami from the fifth
cervical nerve (C5) to the first thoracic nerve (T1). In one specimen, the
ventral ramus of the fourth cervical nerve joined with the brachial plexus. In
five specimens, the upper trunk was composed of C5 and the sixth cervical nerve
(C6). In one specimen, the ventral division of C6 merged with the ventral branch 
of the middle trunk to constitute the lateral cord. The seventh cervical nerve
constituted the middle trunk, and the eighth cervical nerve and T1 formed the
lower trunk in all specimens. The lateral cord gave rise to the musculocutaneous 
nerve, and the remaining component merged with the medial cord. The confluence of
the lateral and medial cords immediately bifurcated into the median and ulnar
nerves. These branching patterns of the musculocutaneous, median, and ulnar
nerves were consistent and similar to the human counterparts. In the dorsal
division, the single posterior cord as observed in the human brachial plexus was 
not observed. The axillary artery did not pass between the medial and lateral
roots of the median nerve, and the axillary artery bifurcated into the brachial
artery and the superficial brachial artery. Anat Rec, 300:1299-1306, 2017. © 2017

BACKGROUND: Licensed antiviral therapeutics and vaccines to protect against
eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) in humans currently do not exist. Animal
models that faithfully recapitulate the clinical characteristics of human EEEV
encephalitic disease, including fever, drowsiness, anorexia, and neurological
signs such as seizures, are needed to satisfy requirements of the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) for clinical product licensing under the Animal Rule.
METHODS: In an effort to meet this requirement, we estimated the median lethal
dose and described the pathogenesis of aerosolized EEEV in the common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus). Five marmosets were exposed to aerosolized EEEV FL93-939 in
doses ranging from 2.4 × 101 PFU to 7.95 × 105 PFU.
RESULTS: The median lethal dose was estimated to be 2.05 × 102 PFU. Lethality was
observed as early as day 4 post-exposure in the highest-dosed marmoset but
animals at lower inhaled doses had a protracted disease course where humane study
endpoint was not met until as late as day 19 post-exposure. Clinical signs were
observed as early as 3 to 4 days post-exposure, including fever, ruffled fur,
decreased grooming, and leukocytosis. Clinical signs increased in severity as
disease progressed to include decreased body weight, subdued behavior, tremors,
and lack of balance. Fever was observed as early as day 2-3 post-exposure in the 
highest dose groups and hypothermia was observed in several cases as animals
became moribund. Infectious virus was found in several key tissues, including
brain, liver, kidney, and several lymph nodes. Clinical hematology results
included early neutrophilia, lymphopenia, and thrombocytopenia. Key pathological 
changes included meningoencephalitis and retinitis. Immunohistochemical staining 
for viral antigen was positive in the brain, retina, and lymph nodes. More
intense and widespread IHC labeling occurred with increased aerosol dose.
CONCLUSION: We have estimated the medial lethal dose of aerosolized EEEV and
described the pathology of clinical disease in the marmoset model. The results
demonstrate that the marmoset is an animal model suitable for emulation of human 
EEEV disease in the development of medical countermeasures.

α-Synuclein is a defining, key component of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites in
Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), as well as glial
cytoplasmic inclusions in multiple system atrophy (MSA). The distribution and
spreading of these pathologies are closely correlated with disease progression.
Recent studies have revealed that intracerebral injection of synthetic
α-synuclein fibrils or pathological α-synuclein prepared from DLB or MSA brains
into wild-type or transgenic animal brains induced prion-like propagation of
phosphorylated α-synuclein pathology. The common marmoset is a very small primate
that is expected to be a useful model of human diseases. Here, we show that
intracerebral injection of synthetic α-synuclein fibrils into adult wild-type
marmoset brains (caudate nucleus and/or putamen) resulted in spreading of
abundant α-synuclein pathologies, which were positive for various antibodies to
α-synuclein, including phospho Ser129-specific antibody, anti-ubiquitin and
anti-p62 antibodies, at three months after injection. Remarkably, robust Lewy
body-like inclusions were formed in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neurons in
these marmosets, strongly suggesting the retrograde spreading of abnormal
α-synuclein from striatum to substantia nigra. Moreover, a significant decrease
in the numbers of TH-positive neurons was observed in the injection-side of the
brain, where α-synuclein inclusions were deposited. Furthermore, most of the
α-synuclein inclusions were positive for 1-fluoro-2,5-bis
(3-carboxy-4-hydroxystyryl) benzene (FSB) and thioflavin-S, which are dyes widely
used to visualize the presence of amyloid. Thus, injection of synthetic
α-synuclein fibrils into brains of non-transgenic primates induced PD-like
α-synuclein pathologies within only 3 months after injection. Finally, we provide
evidence indicating that neurons with abnormal α-synuclein inclusions may be
cleared by microglial cells. This is the first marmoset model for α-synuclein
propagation. It should be helpful in studies to elucidate mechanisms of disease
progression and in development and evaluation of disease-modifying drugs for
α-synucleinopathies.

BACKGROUND: Myeloid sarcoma is a rare manifestation of myeloproliferative
disorder defined as an extramedullary mass composed of myeloid precursor cells. A
9-month old, female, common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) had increased
respiratory effort.
METHODS: A complete necropsy with histology and immunohistochemistry was
performed.
RESULTS: The thymus was replaced by a firm, gray-tan mass with a faint green
tint, filling over 50% of the thoracic cavity. Sheets of granulocytes, lymphoid
cells, nucleated erythrocytes, megakaryocytes, and hematopoietic precursors of
indeterminate cell lineage replaced the thymus, perithymic connective tissue,
mediastinal adipose tissues, epicardium, and much of the myocardium. The cells
demonstrated diffuse strong cytoplasmic immunoreactivity for lysozyme, and
strong, multifocal membranous immunoreactivity for CD117.
CONCLUSION: We report the first case of a myeloid sarcoma in a common marmoset
(C. jacchus), similar to reported human cases of mediastinal myeloid sarcoma, and
present a review of myeloproliferative diseases from the veterinary literature.

BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) psychosis is encountered in as many as 50%
of patients with advanced disease. Treatment options for PD psychosis are few. In
fact, only clozapine and pimavanserin have shown efficacy in randomised
controlled trials. Clinicians are often reluctant to prescribe the former, due to
the risk of agranulocytosis, while the latter is not widely available yet.
Because it is already clinically available and exhibits high affinity for
serotonin 2A receptors, a target with which both clozapine and pimavanserin
interact, we hypothesised that the anti-depressant mirtazapine might be effective
to alleviate PD psychosis.
METHODS: Here, we tested the anti-psychotic potential of mirtazapine in the
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-lesioned common marmoset.
Five MPTP-lesioned marmosets exhibiting psychosis-like behaviours were
administered L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) in combination with
mirtazapine (0.1, 1 and 10 mg/kg) or vehicle. We also tested the effect of
mirtazapine on L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia.
RESULTS: The addition of mirtazapine 10 mg/kg to L-DOPA reduced psychosis-like
behaviours by 50% (P < 0.05) and dyskinesia by 29% (P < 0.01), when compared to
L-DOPA/vehicle. Importantly, the antipsychotic and antidyskinetic effects of
mirtazapine were achieved without hindering L-DOPA anti-parkinsonian action.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that mirtazapine may be effective to alleviate
PD psychosis and, because the drug is clinically available, clinical trials that 
would assess its anti-psychotic efficacy in PD could be rapidly undertaken,
hopefully leading to a new treatment option for this debilitating condition.

Cooperatively breeding, group-living common marmosets show differentiated
relationships, where more strongly bonded dyads within a group engage more in
affiliative interactions than less strongly bonded ones. Intriguingly, recent
results suggest that strong bonds do not only occur between breeding partners but
between individuals from any sex or status, and that strong-bond partners exhibit
correlated oxytocin fluctuations (dyadic oxytocin synchrony, OTS) over a period
of six weeks. To date, it is unclear whether such relationships are stable over
time and whether they are also reflected in higher partner-specific proactive
prosociality. To assess the long-term stability of the relationship structure of 
common marmoset family groups, we investigated whether hormonal and behavioral
markers of group structure (dyadic OTS, dyadic affiliation, and individual group 
integration) in common marmoset families remained stable over a period of six
months. We collected baseline urinary OT and social behavior of 36 dyads from
three family groups in a non-reproductive period (period A), and again six months
later, around the birth of new infants (period B). Patterns of dyadic OTS, dyadic
affiliation, and individual group integration were consistent between the two
study periods. Oxytocin data from a fourth group (10 dyads), collected in two
non-reproductive periods separated by a period of more than five years, could
replicate this finding. Furthermore, OTS was also correlated with proactive
prosociality that was assessed experimentally for 38 dyads during an earlier
study. These results suggest that differentiated relationships are stable over
time, even between group members other than the breeding pair, and that more
strongly bonded partners also show higher levels of proactive prosociality.
Future studies are necessary to identify whether these relationships have an
adaptive function, perhaps with regard to positive consequences on
cooperativeness.

Harmonicity is a fundamental element of music, speech, and animal vocalizations. 
How the auditory system extracts harmonic structures embedded in complex sounds
and uses them to form a coherent unitary entity is not fully understood. Despite 
the prevalence of sounds rich in harmonic structures in our everyday hearing
environment, it has remained largely unknown what neural mechanisms are used by
the primate auditory cortex to extract these biologically important acoustic
structures. In this study, we discovered a unique class of harmonic template
neurons in the core region of auditory cortex of a highly vocal New World
primate, the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), across the entire hearing
frequency range. Marmosets have a rich vocal repertoire and a similar hearing
range to that of humans. Responses of these neurons show nonlinear facilitation
to harmonic complex sounds over inharmonic sounds, selectivity for particular
harmonic structures beyond two-tone combinations, and sensitivity to harmonic
number and spectral regularity. Our findings suggest that the harmonic template
neurons in auditory cortex may play an important role in processing sounds with
harmonic structures, such as animal vocalizations, human speech, and music.

Common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) have recently gained popularity in
biomedical research as models of aging research. Basically, they confer
advantages from other non-human primates due to their shorter lifespan with onset
of appearance of aging at 8 years. Old marmosets present some markers linked to
neurodegeneration in the brain such as amyloid beta (Aβ)1-42 and Aβ1-40. However,
there are no studies exploring other cellular markers associated with
neurodegenerative diseases in this non-human primate. Using immunohistochemistry,
we analyzed brains of male adolescent, adult, old, and aged marmosets. We
observed accumulation of Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42 in the cortex of aged subjects. Tau
hyperphosphorylation was already detected in the brain of adolescent animals and 
increased with aging in a more fibrillary form. Microglia activation was also
observed in the aging process, while a dystrophic phenotype accumulates in aged
subjects. Interestingly, dystrophic microglia contained hyperphosphorylated tau, 
but active microglia did not. These results support previous findings regarding
microglia dysfunctionality in aging and neurodegenerative diseases as Alzheimer's
disease. Further studies should explore the functional consequences of these
findings to position this non-human primate as animal model of aging and
neurodegeneration.

Animal models of rheumatoid arthritis are important in the elucidation of
etiopathogenic mechanisms of the disease and for the development of promising new
therapies. Species specificity of new biological compounds and their mode of
action preclude safety and efficacy testing in rodent models of disease. Nonhuman
primates (NHP) can fill this niche and provide the only relevant model. Over the 
last two decades models of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) were developed in the
rhesus monkey and the common marmoset. However, NHP are higher-order animals and 
complex sentient beings. So especially in models where pain is an intricate part 
of the disease, analgesia needs to be addressed because of ethical
considerations. In our model, a morphine-based pain relief was used that does not
interfere with the normal development of disease allowing us to evaluate
important mechanistic aspects of the arthritis.

Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is essential for mammalian folliculogenesis
and spermatogenesis. Common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a New World primate 
which exhibits an unusual FSH profile across the ovarian cycle with a
mid-follicular FSH peak that is not observed in Catarrhini primates like humans. 
Since transcription of FSH β-subunit gene (FSHβ) is a rate-limiting step in the
production of mature FSH, this study aimed to investigate the regulation of
marmoset FSHβ gene expression in comparison to human. In silico analysis of the
FSHβ promoter sequences identified a TATA box element upstream of the
conventional TATA box element in marmoset but not in human sequence. FSHβ mRNA
transcript longer than the conventional transcript was detected in marmoset
pituitary implying presence of a distal transcription start site. In luciferase
reporter assays, the marmoset putative distal promoter had higher activity than
the corresponding human region even in absence of the conventional proximal
promoter. Indeed higher affinity binding of TATA box-binding protein to the
putative distal TATA box element was obtained in electrophoretic mobility shift
assay. This suggests existence of a differential regulation of FSHβ transcription
in marmoset compared to humans.

Given the strong coupling between the substantia nigra (SN) and striatum (STR) in
the early stage of Parkinson's disease (PD), yet only a few studies reported to
date that have simultaneously investigated the neurochemistry of these two brain 
regions in vivo, we performed longitudinal metabolic profiling in the SN and STR 
of 1-methyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-intoxicated common marmoset monkey 
models of PD (n = 10) by using proton MRS (1 H-MRS) at 9.4 T. T2 relaxometry was 
also performed in the SN by using MRI. Data were classified into control,
MPTP_2weeks, and MPTP_6-10 weeks groups according to the treatment duration. In
the SN, T2 of the MPTP_6-10 weeks group was lower than that of the control group 
(44.33 ± 1.75 versus 47.21 ± 2.47 ms, p < 0.05). The N-acetylaspartate to total
creatine ratio (NAA/tCr) and γ-aminobutyric acid to tCr ratio (GABA/tCr) of the
MPTP_6-10 weeks group were lower than those of the control group (0.41 ± 0.04
versus 0.54 ± 0.08 (p < 0.01) and 0.19 ± 0.03 versus 0.30 ± 0.09 (p < 0.05),
respectively). The glutathione to tCr ratio (GSH/tCr) was correlated with T2 for 
the MPTP_6-10 weeks group (r = 0.83, p = 0.04). In the STR, however, GABA/tCr of 
the MPTP_6-10 weeks group was higher than that of the control group (0.25 ± 0.10 
versus 0.16 ± 0.05, p < 0.05). These findings may be an in vivo depiction of the 
altered basal ganglion circuit in PD brain resulting from the degeneration of
nigral dopaminergic neurons and disruption of nigrostriatal dopaminergic
projections. Given the important role of non-human primates in translational
studies, our findings provide better understanding of the complicated evolution
of PD.

In primate retina, the midget, parasol, and small bistratified cell populations
form the large majority of ganglion cells. In addition, there is a variety of
low-density wide-field ganglion cell types that are less well characterized. Here
we studied retinal ganglion cells in the common marmoset, Callithrix jacchus,
using particle-mediated gene transfer. Ganglion cells were transfected with an
expression plasmid for the postsynaptic density 95-green fluorescent protein. The
retinas were processed with established immunohistochemical markers for bipolar
and/or amacrine cells to determine ganglion cell dendritic stratification. In
total over 500 ganglion cells were classified based on their dendritic field
size, morphology, and stratification in the inner plexiform layer. Over 17 types 
were distinguished, including midget, parasol, broad thorny, small bistratified, 
large bistratified, recursive bistratified, recursive monostratified, narrow
thorny, smooth monostratified, large sparse, giant sparse (melanopsin) ganglion
cells, and a group that may contain several as yet uncharacterized types.
Assuming each characterized type forms a hexagonal mosaic, the midget and parasol
cells account for over 80% of all ganglion cells in the central retina but only
∼50% of cells in the peripheral (>2 mm) retina. We conclude that the fovea is
dominated by midget and parasol cells, but outside the fovea the ganglion cell
diversity in marmoset is likely as great as that reported for nonprimate retinas.
Taken together, the ganglion cell types in marmoset retina resemble those
described previously in macaque retina with respect to morphology,
stratification, and change in proportion across the retina.

The neurobiological mechanism of puberty onset in primates is currently only
partly understood. A recent study reported an important role of Dmx-like 2
(DMXL2), a gene encoding rabconnectin-3α vesicular protein, in human subjects
with mental retardation and neuroendocrine impairment of reproduction. To further
characterize the potential role of DMXL2 in the regulation of reproduction, we
analyzed the expression of DMXL2 in hypothalami of newborn, infantile, juvenile, 
pubertal, and postpubertal female and male common marmoset monkeys. Additionally,
as the relative hypothalamic levels of gonadotropin-inhibitory hormone (GnIH)
transcript during postnatal development are unknown in primates, we also
quantified messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of RFRP, a gene encoding GnIH. Moreover,
the transcript levels of kisspeptin, a well-known regulator of the hypothalamic
neurohormonal axis controlling reproduction, were also checked. Transcript and
protein levels of DMXL2 and Kiss1 transcript levels increase from the newborn to 
the infantile and from the juvenile (prepubertal) to the pubertal and the
postpubertal period. We also noted a clear upsurge in RFRP transcript levels in
the prepubertal period. In conclusion, the hypothalamic expressions of Kiss1 and 
DMXL2 mRNA increase during infantile, pubertal, and adult stages compared to
newborn and juvenile stages in common marmoset monkeys. In contrast, the
expression of RFRP mRNA upsurges in juvenile monkeys. Further mechanistic studies
are needed to characterize the potential inhibitory role of the GnIH-GPR147
signaling in the prepubertal period and the role of DMXL2 in the molecular
cascade regulating the neuroendocrine reproductive axis in primates.

Stem cells are important for regenerative medicine mainly due to their
multilineage differentiation capacity. However, the cells rapidly loose this
capability during culturing. Cryopreservation preserves the differentiation
potential of the cells, until they are needed. In this study, specific cell
properties of multipotent stromal cells (MSCs), from the common marmoset monkey
Callithrix jacchus MSCs derived from amnion (Am) and bone marrow (Bm) were
studied in order to predict optimal cooling rates for cryopreservation. Cell
volume behaviour in anisotonic media, hydraulic membrane permeability at supra as
well as subzero temperatures, and time point of intracellular ice formation (IIF)
were investigated by Coulter Counter and cryomicroscopy. Cryopreservation outcome
was studied using the predicted and experimentally determined cooling rate
followed by 24 h re-cultivation. Little differences in osmotically inactive
volume were found between amnion (0.27 × Vo) and bone marrow (0.28 × Vo) derived 
MSCs. The activation energy for water transport at suprazero temperature was
found to be similar for both cell types; 4.4 ± 0.2 and 5.0 ± 0.15 kcal mol-1 for 
amnion and bone marrow derived MSCs, respectively. At subzero temperatures in the
absence of dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO), the activation energy for water transport 
increased to 24.8 ± 3 kcal mol-1 and 27.4 ± 0.9 kcal mol-1 for Am and BmMSCs
respectively. In the presence of Me2SO, activation energies were found to be
11.6 ± 0.3 kcal mol-1 and 19.5 ± 0.5 kcal mol-1 respectively. Furthermore, Me2SO 
was found to decrease the incidence of intracellular ice formation. The predicted
optimal cooling rates of 11.6 ± 0.9 °C/min (AmMSCs) and 16.3 ± 0.5 °C/min
(BmMSCs) resulted in similar post-thaw viability values compared to the
experimentally determined optimal cooling profiles of 7.5 °C/min to -30 °C,
followed by 3 °C/min to -80 °C.

Although evidence from human studies has long indicated the crucial role of the
frontal cortex in speech production, it has remained uncertain whether the
frontal cortex in nonhuman primates plays a similar role in vocal communication. 
Previous studies of prefrontal and premotor cortices of macaque monkeys have
found neural signals associated with cue- and reward-conditioned vocal
production, but not with self-initiated or spontaneous vocalizations (Coudé et
al., 2011; Hage and Nieder, 2013), which casts doubt on the role of the frontal
cortex of the Old World monkeys in vocal communication. A recent study of
marmoset frontal cortex observed modulated neural activities associated with
self-initiated vocal production (Miller et al., 2015), but it did not delineate
whether these neural activities were specifically attributed to vocal production 
or if they may result from other nonvocal motor activity such as orofacial motor 
movement. In the present study, we attempted to resolve these issues and examined
single neuron activities in premotor cortex during natural vocal exchanges in the
common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a highly vocal New World primate. Neural
activation and suppression were observed both before and during self-initiated
vocal production. Furthermore, by comparing neural activities between
self-initiated vocal production and nonvocal orofacial motor movement, we
identified a subpopulation of neurons in marmoset premotor cortex that was
activated or suppressed by vocal production, but not by orofacial movement. These
findings provide clear evidence of the premotor cortex's involvement in
self-initiated vocal production in natural vocal behaviors of a New World
primate.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Human frontal cortex plays a crucial role in
speech production. However, it has remained unclear whether the frontal cortex of
nonhuman primates is involved in the production of self-initiated vocalizations
during natural vocal communication. Using a wireless multichannel neural
recording technique, we observed in the premotor cortex neural activation and
suppression both before and during self-initiated vocalizations when marmosets, a
highly vocal New World primate species, engaged in vocal exchanges with
conspecifics. A novel finding of the present study is the discovery of a
subpopulation of premotor cortex neurons that was activated by vocal production, 
but not by orofacial movement. These observations provide clear evidence of the
premotor cortex's involvement in vocal production in a New World primate species.

Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) catalyzes the O-methylation of endogenous
catechol amines and estrogens and exogenous catechol-type of drugs. A Parkinson's
disease model of common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) has been widely used in
preclinical studies to evaluate inhibitory potential of new drug candidates on
marmoset COMT. Despite COMT inhibitors could potentiate the pharmacological
action of levodopa on Parkinson's disease in animal models, marmoset COMT cDNA
has not yet been identified and characterized. In this study, a cDNA highly
homologous to human COMT was cloned from marmoset livers. This cDNA encoded 268
amino acids containing a transmembrane region and critical amino acid residues
for catalytic function. The amino acid sequences of marmoset COMT shared high
sequence identity (90%) with human COMT. COMT mRNA was expressed in all five
tissues tested, including brain, lung, liver, kidney and small intestine, and was
more abundant in marmoset liver and kidney. Membrane-bound COMT was
immunochemically detected in livers and kidneys, whereas soluble COMT was
detected in livers, similar to humans. These results indicated that the molecular
characteristics of marmoset COMT were generally similar to the human ortholog.

Non-human primates (NHP) provide important animal models for studies on immune
responses to infections and vaccines. When assessing cellular immunity in NHP,
cytokines are almost exclusively analyzed utilizing cross-reactive anti-human
antibodies. The functionality of antibodies has to be empirically established for
each assay/application as well as NHP species. A rational approach was employed
to identify monoclonal antibodies (mAb) cross-reactive with many NHP species.
Panels of new and established mAbs against human Interferon (IFN)-γ and
Interleukin (IL)-2 were assessed for reactivity with eukaryotically expressed
recombinant IFN-γ and IL-2, respectively, from Old (rhesus, cynomolgus and
pigtail macaques, African green monkey, sooty mangabey and baboon) and New World 
NHP (Ma's night monkey, squirrel monkey and common marmoset). Pan-reactive mAbs, 
recognizing cytokines from all NHP species, were further analyzed in capture
assays and flow cytometry with NHP peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC).
Pan-reactive mAb pairs for IFN-γ well as IL-2 were identified and used in ELISA
to measure IFN-γ and IL-2, respectively, in Old and New World NHP PBMC
supernatants. The same mAb pairs displayed high functionality in ELISpot and
FluoroSpot for the measurement of antigen-specific IFN-γ and IL-2 responses using
cynomolgus PBMC. Functionality of pan-reactive mAbs in flow cytometry was also
verified with cynomolgus PBMC. The development of well-defined immunoassays
functional with a panel of NHP species facilitates improved analyses of cellular 
immunity and enables inclusion in multiplex cytokine assays intended for a
variety of NHP.

BACKGROUND: Inherited and acquired marrow failure syndromes most commonly lead to
defect in myeloid and/or neutrophil differentiation and/or function. Besides
this, neutropenia induced by cancer-adjusted chemotherapy is a frequent clinical 
problem. In both cases, cell replacement therapy is a well-established, but due
to necessity of donors limited and perilous procedure. Therefore, autologous cell
replacement from patients' own marrow-derived cells lowers risk and bares new
possibilities for therapy. Since the immune system of the marmoset monkey is
known to show high similarity to humans, preclinical studies with these animals
bare high hopes for immunologic research and cell replacement therapy.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Marmoset-induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells (cj-iPSC)
were first cultivated on mouse embryonic feeder cells in medium containing
recombinant human vascular endothelial growth factor. After 13 days,
CD34+/vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR2)- cells were sorted, 
treated with interleukin (IL-3), thrombopoietin, and stem cell factor for 20 days
and further cultivated with granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and
IL-3 for 10 days.
RESULTS: CD34+/VEGFR2- cells could be generated in high amounts (39.65 ± 6.01%;
2.31 × 105 cells). Afterward, these hematopoietic progenitors could be
successfully differentiated into mature cj-iPSC-derived neutrophils showing
similar morphology, specific surface antigens, and neutrophil-specific gene
products and in vitro phagocytic activity.
CONCLUSION: cj-iPSC-derived neutrophils bare high hopes in hematologic cell
replacement therapy. They exhibit high morphologic similarity to native
neutrophils and present neutrophil-specific surface antigens, antimicrobial
proteins, and gene products yielding an auspicious approach for continuative
experiments including tests in living animals.

In nature, primate lentiviruses infect humans and several Old World monkeys and
apes. However, to date, lentiviruses infecting New World monkeys have not been
described. We studied the susceptibility of common marmoset cells to HIV-1
infection and observed the presence of post-entry blocks to the early phase of
HIV-1 infection in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) and a B lymphocytic cell
line (B-LCL). The blocks present in these cells are dominant and phenotypically
different from each other. In PBLs, the block occurs at the level of reverse
transcription, reducing the accumulation of early and late transcripts, similar
to the block imposed by TRIM5α. However, we have found that marmoset TRIM5α does 
not block HIV-1. In contrast, the restriction factor present in B-LCLs blocks
HIV-1 replication at a later step, after nuclear entry, and inhibits integration.
Additionally, we have identified an HIV-1 capsid mutant, N74D, that is able to
escape the restriction in the marmoset B-LCLs. Our results suggest that the
factors responsible for the blocks present in marmoset PBLs and B-LCLs are
different. We propose the existence of at least two new restriction factors able 
to block HIV-1 infection in marmoset lymphocytes.

The study of local ecological knowledge (LEK) fosters a better understanding of
the relationship between humans and the environment. We assessed respondents'
ecological knowledge of primates in a rural community located near the Atlantic
Forest remnants in the state of Paraíba, Brazil. Populations of Alouatta belzebul
(red-handed howler monkeys), Sapajus flavius (blonde capuchins), and Callithrix
jacchus (the common marmoset) inhabit the region. We conducted 200
semi-structured interviews and applied thematic content analysis, with weighting,
to the responses to quantify the LEK. Respondents showed a low LEK, despite the
community's proximity to forest remnants. However, the LEK was significantly
higher among men, as well as among those who had a greater degree of contact with
the primates. Age did not influence LEK. The studied community apparently does
not intensively exploit the forest resources nor does it economically depend on
primates, which may explain these individuals' low levels of knowledge about
these animals. Such data may support future studies, as well as environmental
education and action plans, especially for A. belzebul and S. flavius, both of
which are endangered species and targets of the National Action Plan for the
Conservation of the Primates of the Northeast.

BACKGROUND: Common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) and cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca 
fascicularis) are used as non-human primate models in preclinical studies for
drug development.
OBJECTIVE: The assessment of P450 induction in hepatocytes from marmosets and
cynomolgus monkeys was performed using typical P450 inducers.
METHODS: Induction of cytochrome P450 1-4 family enzymes was analyzed in two lots
of cultured hepatocytes from common marmosets and cynomolgus monkeys after 24-h
treatment with typical human P450 inducing agents by real-time reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction.
RESULTS: Marmoset P450 3A4 mRNA and P450 2C8/2C19 mRNA in hepatocytes were
strongly (>10- fold) and weakly (>2) induced by rifampicin, respectively.
Marmoset 1A1 and 1A2 mRNA were induced strongly (>200-fold) by β-naphthoflavone
and omeprazole. Marmoset P450 2B6 mRNA was induced (~5-fold) by a constitutive
androstane receptor agonist, but not by phenobarbital. Cynomolgus monkey P450 3A4
mRNA and P450 1A1 mRNA in cultured hepatocytes were also induced by rifampicin
and omeprazole, respectively, but P450 2B6 mRNA was not induced by phenobarbital.
CONCLUSION: These results indicate that P450 1A/3A induction by typical human
P450 inducers in hepatocytes from marmosets and/or cynomolgus monkeys are similar
to those of humans (except for P450 2B induction by phenobarbital in humans),
suggesting that marmosets and cynomolgus monkeys might be suitable models for
evaluating the drug interactions in preclinical studies.

This study aimed to evaluate the effect of liposomes loaded with diclofenac, a
potent cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and COX-2 inhibitor, on laser-induced choroidal
neovascularization (CNV) in mice and non-human primates (common marmosets). CNV
was induced by laser irradiation on the unilateral or bilateral eye of each mouse
or common marmoset, respectively, under anesthesia. The CNV was visualized using 
fluorescence labeling with intravenous injection of fluoresceinconjugated dextran
(molecular weight = 2,000 kDa), and quantified in the retinal pigment epithelia
(RPE)-choroidal flatmounts. Diclofenac-loaded liposome or diclofenac ophthalmic
solution was instillated to the eye surface daily for 14 days and 21 days in mice
and common marmosets, respectively. In the mouse CNV model, 0.1%
diclofenac-loaded liposome eye drops administered four times a day (q.i.d.)
significantly reduced CNV formation in the RPE-choroidal flatmounts compared with
those in empty liposome eye drops. Diclofenac-loaded liposome (0.1%) eye drops,
administered once a day (s.i.d.), twice a day (b.i.d.), and three times a day
(t.i.d.), also reduced CNV formation in a frequency-dependent manner.
Furthermore, diclofenac-loaded liposome (0.03% and 0.1%) eye drops administered
t.i.d. reduced CNV formation in a dose-dependent manner, significantly so at
0.1%. In the common marmoset CNV model, late hyperfluorescence and leakage by
fluorescein angiograms was observed within or beyond the lesion borders at 17
days after laser irradiation, and diclofenac-loaded liposome eye drops (0.1%
t.i.d.) tended to attenuate the late hyperfluorescence and leakage.
Diclofenac-loaded liposomes had significantly reduced CNV formation in the RPE-
choroidal flatmounts at 21 days after laser irradiation. In conclusion,
diclofenac-loaded liposome eye drops enhance penetration to the RPE-choroid, and 
reduce the CNV formation. These results suggest that a drug-loaded liposome is a 
useful tool for drug delivery into the posterior segment of the eye.

The common marmoset has attracted increasing interest as a model for visual
neuroscience. A measurement of fundamental importance to ensure the validity of
visual studies is spatial acuity. The marmoset has excellent acuity that has been
reported at the fovea to be nearly half that of the human (Ordy and Samorajski
[]: Vision Res 8:1205-1225), a value that is consistent with them having similar 
photoreceptor densities combined with their smaller eye size (Troilo et al. []:
Vision Res 33:1301-1310). Of interest, the marmoset exhibits a higher proportion 
of cones than rods in peripheral vision than human or macaque, which in principle
could endow them with better peripheral acuity depending on how those signals are
pooled in subsequent processing. Here, we introduce a simple behavioral paradigm 
to measure acuity and then test how acuity in the marmoset scales with
eccentricity. We trained subjects to fixate a central point and detect a
peripheral Gabor by making a saccade to its location. First, we found that
accurate assessment of acuity required correction for myopia in all adult
subjects. This is an important point because marmosets raised in laboratory
conditions often have mild to severe myopia (Graham and Judge []: Vision Res
39:177-187), a finding that we confirm, and that would limit their utility for
studies of vision if uncorrected. With corrected vision, we found that their
acuity scales with eccentricity similar to that of humans and macaques, having
roughly half the value of the human and with no clear departure for higher acuity
in the periphery. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Develop Neurobiol 77: 300-313,

The common marmoset is a non-human primate that has increasingly employed in the 
biomedical research including the fields of neuroscience and behavioral studies. 
Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D has been speculated to be involved in psycho-neurologic 
actions in the human brain. In the present study, to clarify the role of CYP2D in
the marmoset brain, we investigated the expression patterns of CYP2D mRNA in the 
brain using in situ hybridization (ISH). In addition, to identify the gene
location of CYP2D19, a well-studied CYP2D isoform in the common marmoset, a
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) study was performed. Consistent with
findings for the human brain, CYP2D mRNA was localized in the neuronal cells of
different brain regions; e.g., the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, substantia
nigra, and cerebellum. FISH analysis showed that the CYP2D19 gene was located on 
chromosome 1q, which is homologous to human chromosome 22 on which the CYP2D6
gene exists. These results suggest that CYP2D in the marmoset brain may play the 
same role as human CYP2D6 in terms of brain actions, and that the CYP2D19 gene is
conserved in a syntenic manner. Taken together, these findings suggest that the
common marmoset is a useful model for studying psychiatric disorders related to
CYP2D dysfunction in the brain.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a highly vocal New World primate
species that has emerged in recent years as a promising model system for studies 
of auditory and vocal processing. Our recent studies have examined perceptual
mechanisms related to the pitch of harmonic complex tones in this species.
However, no previous psychoacoustic work has measured marmosets' frequency
discrimination abilities for pure tones across a broad frequency range. Here we
systematically examined frequency difference limens (FDLs), which measure the
minimum discriminable frequency difference between two pure tones, in marmosets
across most of their hearing range. Results show that marmosets' FDLs are
comparable to other New World primates, with lowest values in the frequency range
of ∼3.5-14 kHz. This region of lowest FDLs corresponds with the region of lowest 
hearing thresholds in this species measured in our previous study and also with
the greatest concentration of spectral energy in the major types of marmoset
vocalizations. These data suggest that frequency discrimination in the common
marmoset may have evolved to match the hearing sensitivity and spectral
characteristics of this species' vocalizations.

The timing of de novo DNA methylation in male germ cells during human testicular 
development is yet unsolved. Apart from that, the stability of established
imprinting patterns in vitro is controversially discussed. This study aimed at
determining the timing of DNA de novo methylation and at assessing the stability 
of the methylation status in vitro. We employed the marmoset monkey (Callithrix
jacchus) as it is considered the best non-human primate model for human
testicular development. We selected neonatal, pre-pubertal, pubertal, and adult
animals (n = 3, each) and assessed germ cell global DNA methylation levels by
5-methyl cytosine staining, and Alu elements and gene-specific methylation (H19, 
LIT1, SNRPN, MEST, OCT4, MAGE-A4, and DDX-4) by pyrosequencing. De novo
methylation is progressively established during postnatal primate development and
continues until adulthood, a process that is different in most other species.
Importantly, once established, methylation patterns remained stable, as
demonstrated using in vitro cultures. Thus, the marmoset monkey is a unique model
for the study of postnatal DNA methylation mechanisms in germ cells and for the
identification of epimutations and their causes.

We report a methodology to chronically record in vivo brain activity in the awake
common marmoset. Over a month, stable imaging revealed macroscopic sensory maps
in the somatosensory cortex and their underlying cellular activity with a high
signal-to-noise ratio in the awake but not anesthetized state. This methodology
is applicable to other brain regions, and will be useful for studying cortical
activity and plasticity in marmosets during learning, development, and in
neurological disorders.

The common marmoset has recently gained interest as an animal model for systems
and behavioral neuroscience. This is due in part to the advent of transgenic
marmosets, which affords the possibility of combining genetic manipulations with 
physiological recording and behavioral monitoring to study neural systems. In
this review, they will argue that the marmoset provides a unique opportunity to
study the neural basis of voluntary motor control from an integrative
perspective. First, as an intermediate animal model, the marmoset represents an
important bridge in motor system function between other primates, including
humans, and rodents. Second, due to the marmoset's small brain size and
lissencephalic cortex, novel electrophysiological and optical recording
technologies will allow an integrative study of cortical function at multiple
spatial scales beyond that afforded by other non-human primate models. Finally,
as a primate expressing an ancestral state of corticospinal organization, the
marmoset offers the possibility of understanding the integrative function of
cortical and spinal interneuron circuitry in isolation of more recent
corticomotoneuronal elaborations. If the potential of the marmoset as a model
species is to be realized, they will need to learn to work with their natural
behavioral repertoire. They have concluded by considering practical aspects of
studying motor systems with marmosets. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Develop

Menopausal women often suffer from hot flashes and sleep disturbances that
significantly impact their quality of life. Both human and animal studies suggest
that loss of estrogens during menopause contribute to these symptoms. In the
female rat, both core body temperature (CBT) and sleep are sensitive to
17β-estradiol (E2) levels, but important differences between the rat and the
human patterns limit the interpretation of the results. The sleep and
thermoregulation of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) more closely
resemble human patterns. However, no study to date has examined whether E2
influences sleep and thermoregulation in this species. The main goal of the
present study was to investigate the suitability of the ovariectomized (OVX)
marmoset for studying two major menopausal symptoms experienced by women, sleep
disturbance and thermodysregulation. Two middle-aged OVX marmosets (6years old)
were implanted with a telemeter that records electroencephalograms (EEG),
electromyograms (EMG), and CBT. Sleep patterns and CBT were recorded under
baseline, two E2 replacement (6 and 12μg/kg/day, p.o.) conditions and two E2
withdrawal conditions. Relative to both baseline and withdrawal, high E2
replacement was associated with lower nighttime CBT. In addition, fewer nighttime
arousals were observed under low E2 replacement compared to baseline. Higher
delta power was observed under both E2 replacement conditions suggesting enhanced
sleep quality. These preliminary results suggest that E2 modulates sleep and
thermoregulation in the OVX marmoset, making it a promising model for studying
menopausal symptoms.

Prenatal maternal infections with Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) correlate with an
increased lifetime probability for the offspring to develop psychosis. We could
previously demonstrate that in human choroid plexus papilloma cells, anti-NG
antibodies (α-NG) bind to mitochondrial proteins HSP60 and ATPB, and interfere
with cellular energy metabolism. To assess the in vivo relevance for this,
especially during prenatal neural development, we investigated here interactions 
of NG-specific antisera (α-NG1, α-NG2) with brain, choroid plexus and other
non-neural tissues in pre- and perinatal samples of the nonhuman primate (NHP)
Callithrix jacchus (CJ), a NHP model for preclinical research. In histological
sections at embryonic day E75, immunohistochemistry revealed α-NG1 and
-2-staining in choroid plexus, ganglionic hill, optic cup, heart, and liver.
Within the cells, organelle-like structures were labeled, which could be
identified by immunohistochemical double-labeling as mitochondria. Both one- and 
two-dimensional Western blot analysis revealed tissue specific patterns of α-NG1 
immunoreactive bands and spots, respectively, which were subsequently
characterized by mass spectrometry. Thereby we could confirm the interactions of 
α-NG1 with human HSP60 and ATPB also in CJ choroid plexus and liver. Even more
important, in the CJ brain, several new targets, including NCAM1, CRMP2, and
SYT1, were identified, which by unrelated studies have been previously suggested 
to correlate with an increased schizophrenia risk. These findings support the
idea that the marmoset monkey is a useful NHP model to investigate the role of
maternal bacterial infections during prenatal brain development, and thereby
might improve the understanding of this important aspect of schizophrenia
pathology.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a small New World monkey that has
gained significant recent interest in neuroscience research, not only because of 
its compatibility with gene editing techniques, but also due to its tremendous
versatility as an experimental animal model. Neuroimaging modalities, including
anatomical (MRI) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), complemented
by two-photon laser scanning microscopy and electrophysiology, have been at the
forefront of unraveling the anatomical and functional organization of the
marmoset brain. High-resolution anatomical MRI of the marmoset brain can be
obtained with remarkable cytoarchitectonic detail. Functional MRI of the marmoset
brain has been used to study various sensory systems, including somatosensory,
auditory, and visual pathways, while resting-state fMRI studies have unraveled
functional brain networks that bear great correspondence to those previously
described in humans. Two-photon laser scanning microscopy of the marmoset brain
has enabled the simultaneous recording of neuronal activity from thousands of
neurons with single cell spatial resolution. In this article, we aim to review
the main results obtained by our group and by our colleagues in applying
neuroimaging techniques to study the marmoset brain. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals,

data collection.

To understand sleep mechanisms and develop treatments for sleep disorders,
investigations using animal models are essential. The sleep architecture of
rodents differs from that of diurnal mammals including humans and non-human
primates. Sleep studies have been conducted in non-human primates; however, these
sleep assessments were performed on animals placed in a restraint chair connected
via the umbilical area to the recording apparatus. To avoid restraints, cables,
and other stressful apparatuses and manipulations, telemetry systems have been
developed. In the present study, sleep recordings in unrestrained cynomolgus
monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) and common marmoset monkeys (Callithrix jacchus)
were conducted to characterize normal sleep. For the analysis of sleep-wake
rhythms in cynomolgus monkeys, telemetry electroencephalography (EEG),
electromyography (EMG), and electrooculography (EOG) signals were used. For the
analysis of sleep-wake rhythms in marmosets, telemetry EEG and EOG signals were
used. Both monkey species showed monophasic sleep patterns during the dark phase.
Although non-rapid eye movement (NREM) deep sleep showed higher levels at the
beginning of the dark phase in cynomolgus monkeys, NREM deep sleep rarely
occurred during the dark phase in marmosets. Our results indicate that the use of
telemetry in non-human primate models is useful for sleep studies, and that the
different NREM deep sleep activities between cynomolgus monkeys and common
marmoset monkeys are useful to examine sleep functions.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an invaluable tool for the diagnosis and
monitoring of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) as well as for the study of
the disease pathophysiology. Because of its strong clinical, radiological and
histopathological similarities with the human disease, experimental autoimmune
encephalomyelitis (EAE) in the common marmoset has been studied more intensively 
over the past several years. Here, we review the current knowledge on MRI in the 
marmoset EAE, and we outline the physiopathological significance and
translational values of these studies with respect to MS. Accumulating evidences 
suggest that the application of conventional, as well as non-conventional, MRI
techniques in the marmoset EAE is a promising approach to elucidate the
pathological processes underlying the development of inflammatory demyelinated
lesions in the central nervous system, potentially improving the identification
and development of new therapeutics.

Ghrelin was first isolated from human and rat as an endogenous ligand for the
growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHS-R). In the present study, we determined
the ghrelin cDNA sequence of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a
small-bodied New World monkey, and investigated the distribution of
ghrelin-producing cells in the gastrointestinal tract and localization profiles
with somatostatin-producing cells. The marmoset ghrelin cDNA coding region was
354 base pairs, and showed high homology to that in human, rhesus monkey, and
mouse. Marmoset ghrelin consists of 28 amino acids, and the N-terminal region is 
highly conserved as found in other mammalian species. Marmoset preproghrelin and 
mature ghrelin have 86.3% and 92.9% homology, respectively, to their human
counterparts. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that marmoset ghrelin mRNA is
highly expressed in the stomach, but it is not detected in other tissues of the
gastrointestinal tract. In addition, a large number of ghrelin mRNA-expressing
cells and ghrelin-immunopositive cells were detected in the mucosal layer of the 
stomach, but not in the myenteric plexus. Moreover, all the ghrelin cells
examined in the stomach were observed to be closed-type. Double staining showed
that somatostatin-immunopositive cells were not co-localized with
ghrelin-producing cells; however, a subset of somatostatin-immunopositive cells
is directly adjacent to ghrelin-immunopositive cells. These findings suggest that
the distribution of ghrelin cells in marmoset differs from that in rodents, and
thus the marmoset may be a more useful model for the translational study of
ghrelin in primates. In conclusion, we have clarified the expression and cell
distribution of ghrelin in marmoset, which may represent a useful model in
translational study.

Callithrix jacchus are small-bodied Neotropical primates popularly known as
common marmosets. They are endemic to Northeast Brazil and occur in contrasting
environments such as the humid Atlantic Forest and the dry scrub forest of the
Caatinga. Common marmosets live in social groups, usually containing only one
breeding pair. These primates have a parental care system in which individuals
help by providing assistance to the infants even when they are not related to
them. Free-ranging groups use relatively small home ranges (0.5-5 hectares) and
have an omnivorous diet. Because of the shape of their teeth, they actively gouge
tree bark to extract and consume exudates. When foraging for live prey, they
adjust their strategy according to the type of prey. The successful use of
appropriate hunting strategies depends not only on age but also on prey type and 
seems to be mediated by learning and experience. Indeed, common marmosets have
shown unexpected cognitive abilities, such as true imitation. All these aspects
seem to have contributed to the ecological success of this species. Callithrix
jacchus has been widely studied, especially in captivity; even so, a number of
questions remain to be answered about its biology, ecology, and behavior, both in
captivity and the wild. A richer understanding of marmosets' natural behavior and
ecology can have a significant impact on shaping ongoing and future neuroscience 
research. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Develop Neurobiol 77: 244-262, 2017.

Locomotion is precarious in an arboreal habitat, where supports can vary in both 
diameter and level of compliance. Several previous studies have evaluated the
influence of substrate diameter on the locomotor performance of arboreal
quadrupeds. The influence of substrate compliance, however, has been mostly
unexamined. Here, we used a multifactorial experimental design to investigate how
perturbations in both diameter and compliance affect the gait kinematics of
marmosets (Callithrix jacchus; N=2) moving over simulated arboreal substrates. We
used 3D-calibrated video to quantify marmoset locomotion over a horizontal
trackway consisting of variably sized poles (5, 2.5 and 1.25 cm in diameter),
analyzing a total of 120 strides. The central portion of the trackway was either 
immobile or mounted on compliant foam blocks, depending on condition. We found
that narrowing diameter and increasing compliance were both associated with
relatively longer substrate contact durations, though adjustments to diameter
were often inconsistent relative to compliance-related adjustments. Marmosets
also responded to narrowing diameter by reducing speed, flattening center of mass
(CoM) movements and dampening support displacement on the compliant substrate.
For the subset of strides on the compliant support, we found that speed, contact 
duration and CoM amplitude explained >60% of the variation in substrate
displacement over a stride, suggesting a direct performance advantage to these
kinematic adjustments. Overall, our results show that compliant substrates can
exert a significant influence on gait kinematics. Substrate compliance, and not
just support diameter, should be considered a critical environmental variable
when evaluating locomotor performance in arboreal quadrupeds.

Age is the number one risk factor for breast cancer, yet the underlying
mechanisms are unexplored. Age-associated mammary stem cell (MaSC) dysfunction is
thought to play an important role in breast cancer carcinogenesis. Non-human
primates with their close phylogenetic relationship to humans provide a powerful 
model system to study the effects of aging on human MaSC. In particular, the
common marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus) with a relatively short life span is 
an ideal model for aging research. In the present study, we characterized for the
first time the mammary epithelial stem/progenitor cells in the common marmoset.
The MaSC-enriched cells formed four major types of morphologically distinct
colonies when cultured on plates pre-seeded with irradiated NIH3T3 fibroblasts,
and were also capable of forming mammospheres in suspension culture and
subsequent formation of 3D organoids in Matrigel culture. Most importantly, these
3D organoids were found to contain stem/progenitor cells that can undergo
self-renewal and multi-lineage differentiation both in vitro and in vivo. We also
observed a significant decrease of luminal-restricted progenitors with age. Our
findings demonstrate that common marmoset mammary stem/progenitor cells can be
isolated and quantified with established in vitro and in vivo assays used for
mouse and human studies.

Genetic polymorphism in the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of the dopamine
transporter (DAT) gene has been reported in both human and nonhuman primates, and
the variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) polymorphism has been related to
several neurological and psychiatric disorders. As New World primates have been
employed as models in biomedical research in these fields, in the present study
we assessed genetic variation in the DAT gene in 25 robust capuchin monkeys
(Sapajus spp.) and 39 common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus). Using enzymatic
amplification followed by sequencing of amplified fragments, a VNTR polymorphism 
in the 3'-UTR region of the DAT gene was identified in both robust capuchins and 
common marmosets. The polymorphic tandem repeat of 40-bp basic units is similar
to the human VNTR consensus sequence, with size variants composed of 9, 10, and
11 units in marmosets and 8, 9, 13, and 17 basic units in capuchins. We found
behavioral evidence that carrying the 10-repeat DAT allele promotes flexible
choice and maximization of foraging in marmosets tested in an operant choice
paradigm. Moreover, in an intertemporal choice task, capuchins with longer repeat
variants show less self-controlled choices than capuchins with at least one short
repeat variant. Future research should focus on the relationship between these
DAT polymorphisms, dopamine reuptake via the dopamine transporter, and behavioral
and cognitive variation across New World monkey individuals.

PURPOSE: The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a New World primate of
increasing interest to neuroscience and in translational brain research. The
present work describes the design and implementation of individualized 8-channel 
receive-only radiofrequency (RF) coil arrays that provide whole-brain coverage
and allow anatomical and functional MRI experiments in conscious, awake
marmosets.
METHODS: The coil arrays were designed with their elements embedded inside
individualized restraint helmets. The size, geometry, and arrangement of the coil
elements were optimized to allow whole-brain coverage. Coil-to-coil decoupling
was achieved by a combination of geometric decoupling and low input impedance
preamplifiers. The performance of the embedded arrays was compared against that
of one 8-channel receive-only array built to fit the external surface of the
helmets.
RESULTS: Three individualized helmets with embedded coil arrays were built for
three marmosets. Whole-brain coverage was achieved with high sensitivity
extending over the entire cortex. Visual stimulation of conscious awake marmosets
elicited robust BOLD fMRI responses in both primary and higher order visual areas
of the occipitotemporal cortex.
CONCLUSION: The high sensitivity provided by embedded receive-only coil arrays
allows both anatomical and functional MRI data to be obtained with high spatial
resolution in conscious, awake marmosets. Magn Reson Med 78:387-398, 2017. © 2016

Nonhuman primates (NHPs) have been widely used in reproductive biology,
neuroscience, and drug development since a number of primate species are
phylogenetically close to humans. In this review, we summarize the use of NHPs
for nonclinical application in the reproductive system disorders including the
loss or failure of an organ or tissue. Causes of infertility include congenital
aplasia and acquired disorders of the reproductive organs. In addition,
anti-cancer treatments can deplete ovarian follicles, leading to premature
ovarian failure, infertility and long-term health risks. Along with a limited
supply of human reproductive organs, anatomic/physiologic similarities to humans 
support the need for NHP models (New-World monkeys such as the common marmoset
and Old-World monkeys such as cynomolgus and rhesus monkeys) to promote the
advances in female infertility studies. For maintaining and executing animal
studies using NHP, special protocols including animal care, anesthetic protocol, 
surgical technique, and immunosuppressive protocol are necessary. With a growing 
interest in the potential therapies such as endometrial tissue engineering, and
ovary/follicle cryopreservation and grafting in Korea, this review can be useful 
in selecting appropriate animal models and can bridge between nonclinical studies
and clinical applications by providing detailed information on the use of NHPs in
the field of reproductive organ disorders.

The marmoset: An emerging model to unravel the evolution and development of the
primate neocortex.

Throughout evolution, the neocortex has undergone a dramatic expansion providing 
the substrate for increasingly complex cognitive abilities, culminating with
humans. The enlargement of the neocortex did not affect its' basic organization, 
which is remarkably conserved from rodents to primates. The mouse has thus proven
an advantageous model to decipher the molecular and cellular mechanisms
supporting neocortical development. However, it is of limited benefit when
studying the mechanisms leading to the inclusion of higher order association
areas, which form the largest fraction of the primate neocortex. In the quest for
a suitable nonhuman primate model to study the developmental mechanism of
neocortical patterning and expansion, researchers focussed on the Old World
macaque, routinely employed in functional and behavioral studies. However, the
species has many limitations making studies difficult and/or impractical.
Therefore, in the past couple of decades, the New World common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus) has drawn much attention and become an accepted model. The
marmoset has the advantage of a smooth neocortical sheet, enabling the direct
correspondence between developing cortices and the comprehensive map established 
for the adult, with a significant amount of cortical maturation occurring during 
the postnatal period. This review presents the contributions of recent marmoset
studies to our understanding of the mechanisms regulating corticogenesis in a
complex species, the molecular control of neocortical patterning and the
sequential maturation of visual cortical areas while commenting on the future of 
the species in the field. Furthermore, while these new findings are relevant to
developmental biology, in order to understand how new cortical areas have emerged
to expand cognitive abilities, they also represent a foundation for the better
understanding of developmental cognitive disorders. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals,

Currently, the amount of sequenced and classified MHC class I genes of the common
marmoset is limited, in spite of the wide use of this species as an animal model 
for biomedical research. In this study, 480 clones of MHC class I G locus
(Caja-G) cDNA sequences were obtained from 21 common marmosets. Up to 10
different alleles were detected in each common marmoset, leading to the
assumption that the Caja-G loci duplicated in the marmoset genome. In the
investigated population, four alleles occurred more often, giving evidence for
higher immunological advantage of these alleles. In contrast to the human
non-classical MHC class I genes, Caja-G shows high rates of polymorphism at the
relevant peptide-binding sites, despite its phylogenetic relationship to the
non-classical HLA-G. Our results provide information for better understanding of 
the immunological properties of the common marmoset and confirm the theory of a
gene conversion of the Caja-G due to its detected plasticity and the absence of
any known HLA-A equivalent.

1. A cDNA encoding novel cytochrome P450 (P450) 4A enzyme was cloned from
marmoset livers by reverse transcription (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
based on the marmoset genome sequences. The amino acid sequence deduced from P450
4A11 cDNA contained consensus sequences of six substrate recognition sites and
one heme-binding domain. 2. Marmoset P450 4A11, highly identical (85-88%) to
cynomolgus monkey and human P450 4A enzymes, was grouped into the same cluster as
cynomolgus monkey and human P450 4A enzymes by phylogenetic analysis. 3. The
tissue distribution analyses by real-time RT PCR and immunoblotting demonstrated 
that marmoset P450 4A11 mRNA and proteins were expressed in kidneys and livers.
Marmoset P450 4A11 enzyme heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli
preferentially catalyzed the ω-hydroxylation of arachidonic acid and lauric acid,
similar to cynomolgus monkey and human P450 4A11 enzymes. However, lauric acid
ω-hydroxylation activity of marmoset P450 4A11 was low compared with those of
marmoset liver microsomes. 4. These results indicated that novel marmoset P450
4A11 was also a fatty acid ω-hydroxylase expressed in kidneys and livers, with
the same regioselectivity (at ω-position of fatty acid) as cynomolgus monkey and 
human P450 4A enzymes.

BACKGROUND: This study determined the pharmacokinetics of the contrast agent
gadobutrol in marmosets by quantitative MRI to derive guidelines for neuroimaging
protocols.
METHODS: Local concentrations of gadobutrol were determined from consecutive
gradient echo-based mapping of the relaxation rate R1 on a clinical 3T MRI
scanner. Half-time of renal elimination was measured after injection of a triple 
dose of gadobutrol (0.3 mmol/kg) into the saphenous vein. A first-order
single-compartment model was fitted to the measured R1 values and verified by
blood analysis.
RESULTS: Slow injection (1.5 minutes) resulted in an elimination half-time of
26±4 minutes. After bolus injection (15 seconds), elimination was much slower
(62±8 minutes) with 45% larger distribution volumes. Importantly, more gadobutrol
entered the cerebrospinal fluid.
CONCLUSIONS: Slow injection and a latency of about 20 minutes are recommended to 
avoid extravasation. Application of a triple dose of gadobutrol compensates for
the fast elimination in healthy marmosets.

EBV is the major infectious environmental risk factor for multiple sclerosis
(MS), but the underlying mechanisms remain obscure. Patient studies do not allow 
manipulation in vivo. We used the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE)
models in the common marmoset and rhesus monkey to model the association of EBV
and MS. We report that B cells infected with EBV-related lymphocryptovirus (LCV) 
are requisite APCs for MHC-E-restricted autoaggressive effector memory CTLs
specific for the immunodominant epitope 40-48 of myelin oligodendrocyte
glycoprotein (MOG). These T cells drive the EAE pathogenesis to irreversible
neurologic deficit. The aim of this study was to determine why LCV infection is
important for this pathogenic role of B cells. Transcriptome comparison of
LCV-infected B cells and CD20(+) spleen cells from rhesus monkeys shows increased
expression of genes encoding elements of the Ag cross-presentation machinery
(i.e., of proteasome maturation protein and immunoproteasome subunits) and
enhanced expression of MHC-E and of costimulatory molecules (CD70 and CD80, but
not CD86). It was also shown that altered expression of endolysosomal proteases
(cathepsins) mitigates the fast endolysosomal degradation of the MOG40-48 core
epitope. Finally, LCV infection also induced expression of LC3-II(+) cytosolic
structures resembling autophagosomes, which seem to form an intracellular
compartment where the MOG40-48 epitope is protected against proteolytic
degradation by the endolysosomal serine protease cathepsin G. In conclusion, LCV 
infection induces a variety of changes in B cells that underlies the conversion
of destructive processing of the immunodominant MOG40-48 epitope into productive 
processing and cross-presentation to strongly autoaggressive CTLs.

In contrast to the well established macaque monkey, little is known about
functional connectivity patterns of common marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus)
that is poised to become the leading transgenic primate model. Here, we used
resting-state ultra-high-field fMRI data collected from anesthetized marmosets
and macaques along with awake human subjects, to examine and compare the brain's 
functional organization, with emphasis on the saccade system. Exploratory
independent component analysis revealed eight resting-state networks in marmosets
that greatly overlapped with corresponding macaque and human networks including a
distributed frontoparietal network. Seed-region analyses of the superior
colliculus (SC) showed homolog areas in macaques and marmosets. The marmoset SC
displayed the strongest frontal functional connectivity with area 8aD at the
border to area 6DR. Functional connectivity of this frontal region revealed a
similar functional connectivity pattern as the frontal eye fields in macaques and
humans. Furthermore, areas 8aD, 8aV, PG,TPO, TE2, and TE3 were identified as
major hubs based on region-wise evaluation of betweeness centrality, suggesting
that these cortical regions make up the functional core of the marmoset brain.
The results support an evolutionarily preserved frontoparietal system and provide
a starting point for invasive neurophysiological studies in the marmoset saccade 
and visual systems.

Deafness is one of the most common types of congenital impairments, and at least 
half of the cases are caused by hereditary mutations. Mutations of the gene
KIAA1199 are associated with progressive hearing loss. Its expression is abundant
in human cochlea, but interestingly the spatial expression patterns are different
between mouse and rat cochleae; the pattern in humans has not been fully
investigated. We performed immunohistochemical analysis of a nonhuman primate,
common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), cochlea with a KIAA1199-specific antibody. 
In the common marmoset cochlea, KIAA1199 protein expression was more widespread
than in rodents, with all epithelial cells, including hair cells, expressing
KIAA1199. Our results suggest that the primate pattern of KIAA1199 expression is 
wider in comparison with rodents and may play an essential role in the
maintenance of cochlear epithelial cells.

Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are useful for the study of embryonic development.
However, since research on naturally conceived human embryos is limited,
non-human primate (NHP) embryos and NHP ESCs represent an excellent alternative
to the corresponding human entities. Though, ESC lines derived from naturally
conceived NHP embryos are still very rare. Here, we report the generation and
characterization of four novel ESC lines derived from natural preimplantation
embryos of the common marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus). For the first time we
document derivation of NHP ESCs derived from morula stages. We show that
quantitative chromosome-wise transcriptome analyses precisely reflect trisomies
present in both morula-derived ESC lines. We also demonstrate that the female ESC
lines exhibit different states of X-inactivation which is impressively reflected 
by the abundance of the lncRNA X inactive-specific transcript (XIST). The novel
marmoset ESC lines will promote basic primate embryo and ESC studies as well as
preclinical testing of ESC-based regenerative approaches in NHP.

Much has been written about hepatic metastasis and animal models abound. In terms
of the human experience, progress in treating this final common pathway, a
terminal event of many human malignancies has been relatively slow. The current
thinking is that primary prevention is best served by early detection of cancer
and eradication of early stage cancers by screening. Some cancers spread early in
their course and the role of screening may be limited. Until relatively recently 
there has not been a pathfinder model that makes the evasion of this unfortunate 
event a reality. This review discusses such an animal model and attempts to
relate it to human disease in terms of intervention. Concrete proposals are also 
offered on how scientists may be able to intervene to prevent this deadly
progression of the cancer process.

BACKGROUND: Inhibition of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) has emerged as a
viable means to lengthen lifespan and healthspan in mice, although it is still
unclear whether these benefits will extend to other mammalian species. We
previously reported results from a pilot experiment wherein common marmosets
(Callithrix jacchus) were treated orally with rapamycin to reduce mTOR signaling 
in vivo in line with previous reports in mice and humans. Further, long-term
treatment did not significantly alter body weight, daily activity, blood lipid
concentrations, or glucose metabolism in this cohort.
METHODS: In this study, we report on the molecular consequences of rapamycin
treatment in marmosets on mechanisms that regulate protein homeostasis
(proteostasis) in vivo. There is growing appreciation for the role of
proteostasis in longevity and for the role that mTOR plays in regulating this
process. Tissue samples of liver and skeletal muscle from marmosets in our pilot 
cohort were assessed for expression and activity of components of the
ubiquitin-proteasome system, macroautophagy, and protein chaperones.
RESULTS: Rapamycin treatment was associated with increased expression of PSMB5, a
core subunit of the 20S proteasome, but not PSMB8 which is involved in the
formation of the immunoproteasome, in the skeletal muscle and liver.
Surprisingly, proteasome activity measured in these tissues was not affected by
rapamycin. Rapamycin treatment was associated with an increased expression of
mitochondria-targeted protein chaperones in skeletal muscle, but not liver.
Finally, autophagy was increased in skeletal muscle and adipose, but not liver,
from rapamycin-treated marmosets.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these data show tissue-specific upregulation of some, but
not all, components of the proteostasis network in common marmosets treated with 
a pharmaceutical inhibitor of mTOR.

Wolfram syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder of the neuroendocrine system,
known as DIDMOAD (Diabetes Insipidus, Diabetes Mellitus, Optic Atrophy and
Deafness) syndrome, and considered an endoplasmic reticulum disease. Patients
show mutations in WFS1, which encodes the 890 amino acid protein wolframin.
Although Wfs1 knockout mice develop diabetes, their hearing level is completely
normal. In this study, we examined the expression of wolframin in the cochlea of 
a nonhuman primate common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) to elucidate the
discrepancy in the phenotype between species and the pathophysiology of Wolfram
syndrome-associated deafness. The marmoset cochlea showed wolframin
immunoreactivity not only in the spiral ligament type I fibrocytes, spiral
ganglion neurons, outer hair cells, and supporting cells, but in the stria
vascularis basal cells, where wolframin expression was not observed in the
previous mouse study. Considering the absence of the deafness phenotype in Wfs1
knockout mice, the expression of wolframin in the basal cells of primates may
play an essential role in the maintenance of hearing. Elucidating the function of
wolframin protein in the basal cells of primates would be essential for
understanding the pathogenesis of hearing loss in patients with Wolfram syndrome,
which may lead to the discovery of new therapeutics.

In the past decade, the New World common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) has taken 
a seminal position in neurobiological research, fueled in part by its smooth
cortical sheet, which allows cortical areas to be easily accessed by current
technologies on the dorsal surface of the brain. In this protocol, we describe a 
method for the precision placement of agents (e.g., tracers or neurotoxins) into 
small brain regions of the infant and adult marmoset, using an MRI-guided
approach. This strategy uses a protocol for prolonged anesthesia without the need
for intubation that we have recently developed, alongside appropriate analgesia
and monitoring. The protocol can be readily adapted to be used together with
advanced research techniques, such as two-photon microscopy and optical imaging. 
Including a 5-d postoperative care plan, this protocol takes 7 d to complete. The
protocol requires a team of personnel experienced in marmoset care and handling, 
and small-animal neurosurgery; an assistant for monitoring the animal and
assisting with anesthesia; and an MRI technician.

Cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis, an Old World Monkey) have been widely
used as a non-human primate model in preclinical studies because of their genetic
and physiological similarity to humans. This trend has been followed by common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus, a New World Monkey). However, drug-metabolism
properties in these non-human primates have not been fully understood due to
limited information on cytochrome P450 (P450) enzymes, major drug-metabolizing
enzymes in humans. Multiple forms of cynomolgus monkey P450 enzymes have been
identified and characterized in comparison to those of humans, including a
cynomolgus monkey specific form, P450 2C76. Similarly, marmoset P450 1A/B, 2A,
2C, 2D, and 4F enzymes were recently identified and characterized to understand
drug metabolism properties. In this research update, updates for marmoset,
cynomolgus monkey, and human P450 cDNAs are provided. Marmoset and cynomolgus
monkey P450 enzymes showed high sequence homology to their human counterparts and
generally had similar substrate recognition functionality to human P450 enzymes; 
however, they also possibly contribute to limited specific differences in drug
oxidative metabolism partly due to small differences in amino acid residues.
These findings provide a foundation for successful use of non-human primates as
preclinical models and will help to further understand molecular mechanisms of
human P450 function. In addition to the P450 enzymes, flavin-containing
monooxygenases, another monooxygenase family, in these non-human primates have
been found to be involved in the oxidation of a variety of compounds associated
with pharmacological and/or toxicological effects in humans and are also
described.

SHARAKU: an algorithm for aligning and clustering read mapping profiles of deep
sequencing in non-coding RNA processing.

MOTIVATION: Deep sequencing of the transcripts of regulatory non-coding RNA
generates footprints of post-transcriptional processes. After obtaining sequence 
reads, the short reads are mapped to a reference genome, and specific mapping
patterns can be detected called read mapping profiles, which are distinct from
random non-functional degradation patterns. These patterns reflect the maturation
processes that lead to the production of shorter RNA sequences. Recent
next-generation sequencing studies have revealed not only the typical maturation 
process of miRNAs but also the various processing mechanisms of small RNAs
derived from tRNAs and snoRNAs.
RESULTS: We developed an algorithm termed SHARAKU to align two read mapping
profiles of next-generation sequencing outputs for non-coding RNAs. In contrast
with previous work, SHARAKU incorporates the primary and secondary sequence
structures into an alignment of read mapping profiles to allow for the detection 
of common processing patterns. Using a benchmark simulated dataset, SHARAKU
exhibited superior performance to previous methods for correctly clustering the
read mapping profiles with respect to 5'-end processing and 3'-end processing
from degradation patterns and in detecting similar processing patterns in
deriving the shorter RNAs. Further, using experimental data of small RNA
sequencing for the common marmoset brain, SHARAKU succeeded in identifying the
significant clusters of read mapping profiles for similar processing patterns of 
small derived RNA families expressed in the brain.
AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The source code of our program SHARAKU is
available at http://www.dna.bio.keio.ac.jp/sharaku/, and the simulated dataset
used in this work is available at the same link. Accession code: The sequence
data from the whole RNA transcripts in the hippocampus of the left brain used in 
this work is available from the DNA DataBank of Japan (DDBJ) Sequence Read
Archive (DRA) under the accession number DRA004502.

A 5-y-old multiparous female common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) presented with 
acute weight loss of approximately 25% over a 1-wk period. An abdominal mass was 
apparent on physical examination, and radiographs suggested peritoneal effusion. 
Exploratory laparotomy revealed hemoperitoneum and an enlarged, gray,
hemorrhaging uterus; ovariohysterectomy was performed, and the marmoset
recovered. Histologic evaluation of the ovaries and uterus revealed uterine
rupture, with invasion of placental villi lined by trophoblasts through the
myometrium to the serosal layer. Primary uterine rupture is a rare but serious
obstetric event in humans and has been reported only rarely in NHP. This report
is the first description of primary uterine rupture during early pregnancy in a
common marmoset.

It is widely known that the catecholamine group is formed by dopamine,
noradrenaline and adrenaline. Its synthesis is regulated by the enzyme called
tyrosine hydroxylase. 3-hydroxytyramine/dopamine (DA) is a precursor of
noradrenaline and adrenaline synthesis and acts as a neurotransmitter in the
central nervous system. The three main nuclei, being the retrorubral field (A8
group), the substantia nigra pars compacta (A9 group) and the ventral tegmental
area (A10 group), are arranged in the die-mesencephalic portion and are involved 
in three complex circuitries - the mesostriatal, mesolimbic and mesocortical
pathways. These pathways are involved in behavioral manifestations, motricity,
learning, reward and also in pathological conditions such as Parkinson's disease 
and schizophrenia. The aim of this study was to perform a morphological analysis 
of the A8, A9 and A10 groups in the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus - a
neotropical primate), whose morphological and functional characteristics support 
its suitability for use in biomedical research. Coronal sections of the marmoset 
brain were submitted to Nissl staining and TH-immunohistochemistry. The
morphology of the neurons made it possible to subdivide the A10 group into seven 
distinct regions: interfascicular nucleus, raphe rostral linear nucleus and raphe
caudal linear nucleus in the middle line; paranigral and parainterfascicular
nucleus in the middle zone; the rostral portion of the ventral tegmental area
nucleus and parabrachial pigmented nucleus located in the dorsolateral portion of
the mesencephalic tegmentum. The A9 group was divided into four regions:
substantia nigra compacta dorsal and ventral tiers; substantia nigra compacta
lateral and medial clusters. No subdivisions were made for the A8 group. These
results reveal that A8, A9 and A10 are phylogenetically stable across species. As
such, further studies concerning such divisions are necessary in order to
evaluate the occurrence of subdivisions that express DA in other primate species,
with the aim of characterizing its functional relevance.

Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) is a glycoprotein hormone required for female 
and male gametogenesis in vertebrates. Common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a 
New World primate monkey, used as animal model in biomedical research.
Observations like, requirement of extremely high dose of human FSH in marmosets
for superovulation compared to other primates and generation of antibodies in
marmoset against human FSH after repeated superovulation cycles, point towards
the possibility that FSH-FSH receptor (FSHR) interaction in marmosets might be
different than in the humans. In this study we attempted to understand some of
these structural differences using FSH peptides and anti-peptide antibody
approach. Based on sequence alignment, in silico modeling and docking studies, L2
loop of FSH β-subunit (L2β) was found to be different between marmoset and human.
Hence, peptides corresponding to region 32-50 of marmoset and human L2β loop were
synthesized, purified and characterized. The peptides displayed dissimilarity in 
terms of molecular mass, predicted isoelectric point, predicted charge and in the
ability to inhibit hormone-receptor interaction. Polyclonal antibodies generated 
against both the peptides were found to exhibit specific binding for the
corresponding peptide and parent FSH in ELISA and Western blotting respectively
and exhibited negligible reactivity to cross-species peptide and FSH in ELISA.
The anti-peptide antibody against marmoset FSH was also able to detect native FSH
in marmoset plasma samples and pituitary sections. In summary, the L2β loop of
marmoset and human FSH has distinct receptor interaction ability and
immunoreactivity indicating possibility of subtle conformational and biochemical 
differences between the two regions which may affect the FSH-FSHR interaction in 
these two primates. Copyright © 2016 European Peptide Society and John Wiley &

BACKGROUND: Common marmosets are extensively used in immunological and
pharmacological research, and the usage of methods such as flow cytometry gain
increasing importance.
METHODS: Using multicolor flow cytometry cross-reactivity of monoclonal
antibodies with cells of common marmosets was analyzed. Furthermore, frequencies 
of immune cells and immunological parameters were assessed in healthy common
marmosets.
RESULTS: A total of 97 clones of monoclonal antibodies raised against CD markers,
chemokine receptors, and miscellaneous markers were tested. Additionally,
baseline frequencies of different innate and adaptive immune cells as well as
certain parameters, such as activation and memory T-cell and B-cell distribution,
are provided.
CONCLUSION: Our study gives an extended overview of cross-reactive antibodies for
flow cytometric analysis of immune cells as well as baseline values for different
immune parameters in healthy common marmosets.

parturition and post-partum mammary gland milk ejection to the modulation of
neural control of social relationships. This initial study was performed to
investigate the potential use of positron emission tomography (PET) for
localizing oxytocin receptors in two New World primates. Three biomarkers for PET
(1-3) that are known to have high affinity and selectivity for the human oxytocin
receptor were investigated in the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) via PET
imaging. Brain penetration, and uptake in the salivary gland area were both
observed with biomarkers 2 and 3. No brain penetration was observed with 1, but
uptake was observed more specifically in several peripheral endocrine glands
compared to 2 or 3. Biomarker 2, which displayed the best brain penetration of
the three biomarkers in the marmoset, was then investigated in the monogamous
coppery titi monkey (Callicebus cupreus) in a brain scan and a limited full body 
scan. No significant brain penetration of 2 was observed in the titi monkey, but 
significant uptake was observed in various locations throughout the periphery.
Metabolism of 2 was suspected to have been significant based upon HPLC analysis
of blood draws, but parent compound was still present near the end of the scan.
Follow-up investigations will focus on next generation biomarkers bearing
improved binding characteristics and brain penetrability as well as investigating
tissue in regions where biomarker uptake was observed.

Common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) are frequently used as translational animal
models for human diseases. However, a comparative study of cytological and
histochemical detection methods as well as morphometric and ultrastructural
characterization of neutrophils and eosinophils in this species is lacking. Blood
samples of house dust mite sensitized and allergen challenged as well as
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenged marmosets were analyzed with different
cytological and histological staining methods. Furthermore, cell size and number 
of nuclear segments were compared between neutrophils and eosinophils. Electron
microscopy was performed to characterize the ultrastructure of granulocytes. Of
all applied cytological stains, three allowed differentiation of eosinophils and 
neutrophils and, thus, reliable quantification in blood smears:
May-Grünwald-Giemsa stain, Congo Red and Naphthol AS-D Chloroacetate-Esterase.
For histology, Hematoxylin-Eosin (H&E) could not demonstrate clear differences,
whereas Sirius Red, Congo Red, and Naphthol AS-D Chloroacetate Esterase showed
capable results for identification of eosinophils or neutrophils in lung tissue. 
Morphometry revealed that marmoset neutrophils have more nuclear segments and are
slightly larger than eosinophils. Ultrastructurally, eosinophils presented with
large homogeneous electron-dense granules without crystalloid cores, while
neutrophils were characterized by heterogeneous granules of different size and
density. Additionally, sombrero-like vesicles were detected in tissue eosinophils
of atopic marmosets, indicative for hypersensitivity-related piecemeal
degranulation. In conclusion, we provide a detailed overview of marmoset
eosinophils and neutrophils, important for phenotypic characterization of
marmoset models for human airway diseases.

BACKGROUND: The increasing life span of Callithrix jacchus in combination with
the occurrence of metabolic and age-dependent diseases requires improved health
surveillance for this species.
METHODS: The health status of 56 marmosets was studied using a non-invasive blood
pressure (BP) device. Age-, weight-, and sex-dependent changes were analyzed.
Four animals with striking BP findings had follow-up exams.
RESULTS: Physiological and pathological BP values could be defined. BP positively
correlated with age and weight, while no effect of sex could be found.
Measurement time for female and older animals was shorter than for male and
younger individuals. Further analysis of the suspicious patients revealed renal
or hepatic diseases and cardiac alterations.
CONCLUSION: The description of age and weight influences on BP delivers
physiological and pathological values for common marmosets. This may contribute
to the understanding of aging process and cardiology in this primate species.

Over the past few decades, MRI-based visualization of demyelinated CNS lesions
has become pivotal to the diagnosis and monitoring of multiple sclerosis (MS). In
this Review, we outline current efforts to correlate imaging findings with the
pathology of lesion development in MS, and the pitfalls that are being
encountered in this research. Multimodal imaging at high and ultra-high magnetic 
field strengths is yielding biologically relevant insights into the
pathophysiology of blood-brain barrier dynamics and both active and chronic
inflammation, as well as mechanisms of lesion healing and remyelination. Here, we
parallel the results in humans with advances in imaging of a primate model of MS 
- experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in the common marmoset - in
which demyelinated lesions resemble their human counterparts far more closely
than do EAE lesions in the rodent. This approach holds promise for the
identification of innovative biological markers, and for next-generation clinical
trials that will focus more on tissue protection and repair.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) has garnered interest recently as a
powerful model for the future of neuroscience research. Much of this excitement
has centered on the species' reproductive biology and compatibility with gene
editing techniques, which together have provided a path for transgenic marmosets 
to contribute to the study of disease as well as basic brain mechanisms. In step 
with technical advances is the need to establish experimental paradigms that
optimally tap into the marmosets' behavioral and cognitive capacities. While
conditioned task performance of a marmoset can compare unfavorably with rhesus
monkey performance on conventional testing paradigms, marmosets' social behavior 
and cognition are more similar to that of humans. For example, marmosets are
among only a handful of primates that, like humans, routinely pair bond and care 
cooperatively for their young. They are also notably pro-social and exhibit
social cognitive abilities, such as imitation, that are rare outside of the Apes.
In this Primer, we describe key facets of marmoset natural social behavior and
demonstrate that emerging behavioral paradigms are well suited to isolate
components of marmoset cognition that are highly relevant to humans. These
approaches generally embrace natural behavior, which has been rare in
conventional primate testing, and thus allow for a new consideration of neural
mechanisms underlying primate social cognition and signaling. We anticipate that 
through parallel technical and paradigmatic advances, marmosets will become an
essential model of human social behavior, including its dysfunction in
neuropsychiatric disorders.

The marmoset is an emerging animal model for large-scale attempts to understand
primate brain connectivity, but achieving this aim requires the development and
validation of procedures for normalization and integration of results from many
neuroanatomical experiments. Here we describe a computational pipeline for
coregistration of retrograde tracing data on connections of cortical areas into a
3D marmoset brain template, generated from Nissl-stained sections. The procedure 
results in a series of spatial transformations that are applied to the
coordinates of labeled neurons in the different cases, bringing them into common 
stereotaxic space. We applied this procedure to 17 injections, placed in the
frontal lobe of nine marmosets as part of earlier studies. Visualizations of
cortical patterns of connections revealed by these injections are supplied as
Supplementary Materials. Comparison between the results of the automated and
human-based processing of these cases reveals that the centers of injection sites
can be reconstructed, on average, to within 0.6 mm of coordinates estimated by an
experienced neuroanatomist. Moreover, cell counts obtained in different areas by 
the automated approach are highly correlated (r = 0.83) with those obtained by an
expert, who examined in detail histological sections for each individual. The
present procedure enables comparison and visualization of large datasets, which
in turn opens the way for integration and analysis of results from many animals. 
Its versatility, including applicability to archival materials, may reduce the
number of additional experiments required to produce the first detailed cortical 
connectome of a primate brain. J. Comp. Neurol. 524:2161-2181, 2016. © 2016 The

Ion homeostasis in the inner ear is essential for proper hearing. Anion
exchangers are one of the transporters responsible for the maintenance of
homeostasis, but their expression profile in the primate cochlea has not been
fully characterized. However, species-specific overlapping expression patterns
and functional compensation in other organs, such as the kidney, pancreas and
small intestine, have been reported. Here, we determined the expression patterns 
of the anion exchangers SLC26A4, SLC26A5, SLC26A6, SLC26A7, SLC26A11, SLC4A2 and 
SLC4A3 in the cochlea of a non-human primate, the common marmoset (Callithrix
jacchus). Although the pattern of expression of SLC26A4 and SLC26A5 was similar
to that in rodents, SLC26A7, SLC4A2, SLC4A3 exhibited different distributions.
Notably, five transporters, SLC26A4, SLC26A6, SLC26A11 SLC4A2 and SLC4A3, were
expressed in the cells of the outer sulcus. Our results reveal a species-specific
distribution pattern of anion exchangers in the cochlea, particularly in the
outer sulcus cells, suggesting functional compensation among these exchangers.
This "primate-specific" pattern may be related to the human-specific hearing loss
phenotypes of channelopathy disorders, including the SLC26A4-related diseases
Pendred syndrome/DFNB4.

Educational treatment to support social development of children with autism
spectrum disorder (ASD) is an important topic in developmental psychiatry.
However, it remains difficult to objectively quantify the socio-emotional
development of ASD children. To address this problem, we developed a novel
analytical method that assesses subjects' complex behaviors using multivariate
analysis, 'Behavior Output analysis for Quantitative Emotional State Translation'
(BOUQUET). Here, we examine the potential for psycho-cognitive ASD therapy based 
on comparative evaluations of clinical (human) and experimental (animal) models. 
Our observations of ASD children (vs. their normally developing siblings) and the
domestic chick in socio-sensory deprivation models show the importance of
unimodal sensory stimulation, particularly important for tactile- and
auditory-biased socialization. Identifying psycho-cognitive elements in early
neural development, human newborn infants in neonatal intensive care unit as well
as a New World monkey, the common marmoset, also prompted us to focus on the
development of voluntary movement against gravity. In summary, striking
behavioral similarities between children with ASD and domestic chicks'
socio-sensory deprivation models support the role of multimodal sensory-motor
integration as a prerequisite step for normal development of socio-emotional and 
psycho-cognitive functions. Data obtained in the common marmoset model also
suggest that switching from primitive anti-gravity reflexes to complex voluntary 
movement may be a critical milestone for psycho-cognitive development. Combining 
clinical findings with these animal models, and using multivariate integrative
analyses may facilitate the development of effective interventions to improve
social functions in infants and in children with neurodevelopmental disorders.

New drugs often fail in the translation from the rodent experimental autoimmune
encephalomyelitis (EAE) model to human multiple sclerosis (MS). Here, we present 
the marmoset EAE model as an indispensable model for translational research into 
MS. The genetic heterogeneity of this species and lifelong exposure to chronic
latent infections and environmental pathogens create a human-like immune system. 
Unique to this model is the presence of the pathological hallmark of progressive 
MS, in particular cortical grey matter lesions. Another great possibility of this
model is systemic and longitudinal immune profiling, whereas in humans and mice
immune profiling is usually performed in a single compartment (i.e. blood or
spleen, respectively). Overall, the marmoset model provides unique opportunities 
for systemic drug-effect profiling.

The claustrum has been the subject of intense research interest in recent years, 
driven in large part by its extensive connections with various regions of the
cerebral cortex and by hypotheses surrounding its possible role in multimodal
sensory and/or sensory-emotional integration. Here we employed neuroanatomical
tracers to map projections from the claustrum-insular region to the medial
prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortex of the common marmoset (Callithrx
jacchus). These areas were selected based on their identification as "hub" areas 
of the default mode and cortical salience networks, respectively. Microinjections
of fluorescent tracers, along with gold-nanoparticle-conjugated cholera toxin
B-subunit and biotinylated dextran amine, were placed in subdivisions of the
anterior cingulate area 24b/c and in medial prefrontal areas 32 and 32V. The
resulting distribution of transported label showed rostral-caudal and
dorsal-ventral topographic arrangement of claustrum connections and clear
rostral-caudal topography of insular projections. Medial prefrontal connections
were restricted mainly to a ventromedial strip located in the rostral half of the
claustrum, with a second, smaller patch of cells in the caudal, ventrolateral
portion. In contrast, injections into area 24 yielded dense, widespread
connections from the dorsal claustrum, extending along its entire rostral-caudal 
length. Projections from the "classical" agranular, disgranular, and granular
insular areas were sparse or nonexistent in areas 32 and 32V, with progressively 
increasing connections observed in more caudal tracer injections (i.e., in
subdivisions of area 24). Transported label was observed in rostral peri-insular 
areas orbital periallocortex, orbital proisocortex, and insular proisocortex
following all prefrontal injections. These data provide a structural connectivity
foundation for interpretation of functional imaging studies, which often indicate
activity in the "anterior insula" that may arise, in part, from claustrum and/or 
peri-insular projections to the anterior cingulate and medial prefrontal
cortices. J. Comp. Neurol. 525:1421-1441, 2017. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Centromere protein B (CENP-B) is one of the major proteins involved in centromere
formation, binding to centromeric repetitive DNA by recognizing a 17 bp motif
called the CENP-B box. Hominids (humans and great apes) carry large numbers of
CENP-B boxes in alpha satellite DNA (AS, the major centromeric repetitive DNA of 
simian primates). Only negative results have been reported regarding the presence
of the CENP-B box in other primate taxa. Consequently, it is widely believed that
the CENP-B box is confined, within primates, to the hominids. We report here that
the common marmoset, a New World monkey, contains an abundance of CENP-B boxes in
its AS. First, in a long contig sequence we constructed and analysed, we
identified the motif in 17 of the 38 alpha satellite repeat units. We then
sequenced terminal regions of additional clones and found the motif in many of
them. Immunostaining of marmoset cells demonstrated that CENP-B binds to DNA in
the centromeric regions of chromosomes. Therefore, functional CENP-B boxes are
not confined to hominids. Our results indicate that the efficiency of
identification of the CENP-B box may depend largely on the sequencing methods
used, and that the CENP-B box in centromeric repetitive DNA may be more common
than researchers previously thought.

Methylmercury (MeHg) is known to selectively damage the calcarine and precentral 
cortices along deep sulci and fissures in adult cases, but the detailed mechanism
is still unclear. This study aims to identify and analyze the differential
proteome expression in two regions of the cerebrum (the frontal lobe and the
occipital lobe including the calcarine sulcus) of the common marmoset exposed to 
MeHg using a shot-gun proteomic approach. A total of 1045 and 1062 proteins were 
identified in the frontal lobe (FL) and occipital lobe (OL), of which, 62 and 89 
proteins were found significantly changed with MeHg exposure. Functional
enrichment/depletion analysis showed that the lipid metabolic process and
proteolysis were affected in both two lobes. Functional changes in FL were
characterized in cell cycle and cell division, sulfur compound metabolic process,
microtubule-based process and glycerolipid metabolic process. In comparison,
proteins were enriched in the functions of transport, carbohydrate metabolic
process, chemical caused homeostasis and regulation of body fluid levels in OL.
Pathway analysis predicted that vasopressin-regulated water reabsorption was
disturbed in MeHg-treated FL. Our results showed that MeHg induced regional
specific protein changes in FL and OL but with similar endpoint effects such as
energy diminish and disruption of water transport. APOE and GPX1 were shown to be
possible key proteins targeted by MeHg leading to multiple functional changes in 
OL. This is the first report of the whole proteome changes of primate cerebrum
for MeHg neurotoxicity, and the results will contribute to the understanding of
molecular basis of MeHg intoxication in humans.

INTRODUCTION: Insight into susceptibility mechanisms underlying Parkinson's
disease (PD) would aid the understanding of disease etiology, enable target
finding and benefit the development of more refined disease-modifying strategies.
METHODS: We used intermittent low-dose MPTP (0.5 mg/kg/week) injections in
marmosets and measured multiple behavioral and neurochemical parameters.
Genetically diverse monkeys from different breeding families were selected to
investigate inter- and intrafamily differences in susceptibility to MPTP
treatment.
RESULTS: We show that such differences exist in clinical signs, in particular
nonmotor PD-related behaviors, and that they are accompanied by differences in
neurotransmitter levels. In line with the contribution of a genetic component,
different susceptibility phenotypes could be traced back through genealogy to
individuals of the different families.
CONCLUSION: Our findings show that low-dose MPTP treatment in marmosets
represents a clinically relevant PD model, with a window of opportunity to
examine the onset of the disease, allowing the detection of individual
variability in disease susceptibility, which may be of relevance for the
diagnosis and treatment of PD in humans.

BACKGROUND: Hypothalamic kisspeptin-kisspeptin receptor signalling in primates
ensures the successful progression into puberty during development and
maintenance of reproductive capacity during adulthood. Human testis has been
shown to express high-to-moderate levels of kisspeptin and kisspeptin receptor
gene expression. In this study, we aimed at characterizing the localization of
kisspeptin and kisspeptin receptor in adult primate testis tissue.
METHODS: Immunocytochemistry was performed on paraffin-embedded testicular
sections from adult rhesus monkeys and from common marmoset monkeys.
RESULTS: Kisspeptin receptor was detected in Sertoli cells in the periphery of
the seminiferous tubules in adult testes of both species. In contrast, kisspeptin
was not localized in the seminiferous epithelium and was detected only in the
interstitial compartment of the adult rhesus monkey testis.
CONCLUSION: Kisspeptin receptor and kisspeptin are localized in the testis of Old
World and New World primates.

Antagonism of the dopamine D3 receptor is considered a promising strategy for the
treatment of cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia. We have
previously reported that the atypical antipsychotic blonanserin, a dopamine D2/D3
and serotonin 5-HT2A receptor antagonist, highly occupies dopamine D3 receptors
at its antipsychotic dose range in rats. In the present study, we evaluated the
effects of blonanserin on executive function in common marmosets using the object
retrieval with detour (ORD) task. The dopamine D3 receptor-preferring agonist
(+)-PD-128907 at 1mg/kg decreased success rate in the difficult trial, but not in
the easy trial. Since the difference between the two trials is only cognitive
demand, our findings indicate that excess activation of dopamine D3 receptors
impairs executive function in common marmosets. Blonanserin at 0.1mg/kg reversed 
the decrease in success rate induced by (+)-PD-128907 in the difficult trial.
This finding indicates that blonanserin has beneficial effect on executive
function deficit induced by activation of the dopamine D3 receptor in common
marmosets. Next, and based on the glutamatergic hypothesis of schizophrenia, the 
common marmosets were treated with the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor
antagonist ketamine. Ketamine at sub-anesthetic doses decreased success rate in
the difficult trial, but not in the easy trial. Blonanserin at 0.1mg/kg reversed 
the decrease in success rate induced by ketamine in the difficult trial. The
findings of this study suggest that blonanserin might have beneficial effect on
executive dysfunction in patients with schizophrenia.

The effect of routine captive procedures on the welfare of species used as
experimental models in biomedical research is of great interest, since stress may
alter the generalization and interpretation of results. This study investigated
behavioral and endocrine (fecal cortisol) reactivity patterns in common marmoset 
(Callithrix jacchus) adult males (N = 10) and females (N = 9) subjected to three 
types of routine procedures in captivity: (1) moving to a same-sized cage (P1),
to a smaller cage (P2), and (2) first-time pair formation (P3). Sexually
dimorphic cortisol responses were detected in animals submitted to a physical
environmental stressor (cage change). Females showed an increased response
throughout P1, in relation to baseline (BP) cortisol, and a trend during P2.
Males increased cortisol only during P2. On the other hand, males and females
showed a similar endocrine response when management involved social challenge
(pair formation), with both sexes increasing cortisol levels, but females
exhibited a more intense and longer-lasting cortisol increase. Males and females 
exhibited similar behavioral responses to cage change, except for autogrooming,
with males decreasing this behavior in P1. Only females demonstrated a
significantly higher increase in piloerection frequency than that of males during
the pair formation phase. These endocrine and behavioral changes must be taken
into account when interpreting research data that involve these types of
procedures. Further studies on the impacts of routine colony management are
required to devise and include protocols in official husbandry guidelines.

We identified a novel repeat family, termed Platy-1, in the Callithrix jacchus
(common marmoset) genome that arose around the time of the divergence of
platyrrhines and catarrhines and established itself as a repeat family in New
World monkeys (NWMs). A full-length Platy-1 element is ∼100 bp in length, making 
it the shortest known short interspersed element (SINE) in primates, and harbors 
features characteristic of non-LTR retrotransposons. We identified 2268
full-length Platy-1 elements across 62 subfamilies in the common marmoset genome.
Our subfamily reconstruction and phylogenetic analyses support Platy-1
propagation throughout the evolution of NWMs in the lineage leading to C. jacchus
Platy-1 appears to have reached its amplification peak in the common ancestor of 
current day marmosets and has since moderately declined. However, identification 
of more than 200 Platy-1 elements identical to their respective consensus
sequence, and the presence of polymorphic elements within common marmoset
populations, suggests ongoing retrotransposition activity. Platy-1, a SINE,
appears to have originated from an Alu element, and hence is likely derived from 
7SL RNA. Our analyses illustrate the birth of a new repeat family and its
propagation dynamics in the lineage leading to the common marmoset over the last 
40 million years.

Hearing impairment is the most frequent sensory deficit in humans. Deafness
genes, which harbor pathogenic mutations that have been identified in families
with hereditary hearing loss, are commonly expressed in the auditory end organ or
the cochlea and may contribute to normal hearing function, yet some of the mouse 
models carrying these mutations fail to recapitulate the hearing loss phenotype. 
In this study, we find that distinct expression patterns of those deafness genes 
in the cochlea of a non-human primate, the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). 
We examined 20 genes whose expression in the cochlea has already been reported.
The deafness genes GJB3, CRYM, GRHL2, DFNA5, and ATP6B1 were expressed in
marmoset cochleae in patterns different from those in mouse cochleae. Of note,
all those genes are causative for progressive hearing loss in humans, but not in 
mice. The other tested genes, including the deafness gene COCH, in which mutation
recapitulates deafness in mice, were expressed in a similar manner in both
species. The result suggests that the discrepancy in the expression between
rodents and primates may account for the phenotypic difference. This limitation
of the rodent models can be bypassed by using non-human primate models such as
the marmoset.

1. Common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a New World Monkey, has potential to be 
a useful animal model in preclinical studies. However, drug metabolizing
properties have not been fully understood due to insufficient information on
cytochrome P450 (P450), major drug metabolizing enzymes. 2. Marmoset P450 2J2
cDNA was isolated from marmoset livers. The deduced amino acid sequence showed a 
high-sequence identity (91%) with cynomolgus monkey and human P450 2J2 enzymes. A
phylogenetic tree revealed that marmoset P450 2J2 was evolutionarily closer to
cynomolgus monkey and human P450 2J2 enzymes, than P450 2J forms in pigs,
rabbits, rats or mice. 3. Marmoset P450 2J2 mRNA was abundantly expressed in the 
small intestine and liver, and to a lesser extent in the brain, lung and kidney. 
Immunoblot analysis also showed expression of marmoset P450 2J2 protein in the
small intestine and liver. 4. Enzyme assays using marmoset P450 2J2 protein
heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli indicated that marmoset P450 2J2
effectively catalyzed astemizole O-demethylation and terfenadine t-butyl
hydroxylation, similar to human and cynomolgus monkey P450 2J2 enzymes. 5. These 
results suggest the functional characteristics of P450 2J2 enzymes are similar
among marmosets, cynomolgus monkeys and humans.

The common marmoset is a small New World primate that has attracted remarkable
attention as a potential experimental animal link between rodents and humans.
Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector-mediated expression of a disease-causing gene
or a potential therapeutic gene in the brain may allow the construction of a
marmoset model of a brain disorder or an exploration of the possibility of gene
therapy. To gain more insights into AAV vector-mediated transduction profiles in 
the marmoset central nervous system (CNS), we delivered AAV serotype 9 (AAV9)
vectors expressing GFP to the cisterna magna or the cerebellar cortex.
Intracisternally injected AAV9 vectors expanded in the CNS according to the
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow, by retrograde transport through neuronal axons or
via intermediary transcytosis, resulting in diffuse and global transduction
within the CNS. In contrast, cerebellar parenchymal injection intensely
transduced a more limited area, including the cerebellar cortex and cerebellar
afferents, such as neurons of the pontine nuclei, vestibular nucleus and inferior
olivary nucleus. In the spinal cord, both administration routes resulted in
labeling of the dorsal column and spinocerebellar tracts, presumably by
retrograde transport from the medulla oblongata and cerebellum, respectively.
Motor neurons and dorsal root ganglia were also transduced, possibly by diffusion
of the vector down the subarachnoid space along the cord. Thus, these two
administration routes led to distinct transduction patterns in the marmoset CNS, 
which could be utilized to generate different disease animal models and to
deliver therapeutic genes for the treatment of diseases affecting distinct brain 
areas.

The ovary of neonatal nonhuman primates contains the highest number of immature
oocytes, but its cryopreservation has not yet been sufficiently investigated in
all life stages. In the current study, we investigated cryodamage after
vitrification/warming of neonatal ovaries from a nonhuman primate, the common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). A Cryotop was used for cryopreservation of whole
ovaries. The morphology of the vitrified/warmed ovaries was found to be
equivalent to that of fresh ovaries. No significant difference in the number of
oocytes retaining normal morphology per unit area in histological sections was
found between the two groups. In an analysis of dispersed cells from the ovaries,
however, the cell viability of the vitrified/warmed group tended to be decreased.
The results of a comet assay showed no significant differences in DNA damage.
These results show that cryopreservation of neonatal marmoset ovaries using
vitrification may be useful as a storage system for whole ovaries.

Detection of cross-sex chimerism in the common marmoset monkey (Callithrix
jacchus) in interphase cells using fluorescence in situ hybridisation probes
specific for the marmoset X and Y chromosomes.

Michelmann HW, Nayudu PL.

Chimerism associated with placental sharing in marmosets has been traditionally
analysed using conventional chromosome staining on metaphase spreads or
polymerase chain reaction. However, the former technique requires the presence of
proliferating cells, whereas the latter may be associated with possible blood
cell contamination. Therefore, we aimed to develop a single-cell analysis
technique for sexing marmoset cells. We applied fluorescent in situ hybridisation
(FISH) to cell nuclei using differentially labelled X and Y chromosome-specific
probes. Herein we present the validation of this method in metaphase cells from a
marmoset lymphoblastoid cell line, as well as application of the method for
evaluation of cross-sex chimerism in interphase blood lymphocytes and
haematopoietic bone marrow cells from marmosets of same- and mixed-sex litters.
The results show conclusively that haematopoietic cells of bone marrow and
leucocytes from blood are cross-sex chimeric when the litter is mixed sex. In
addition, single samples of liver and spleen cell suspensions from one individual
were tested. Cross-sex chimerism was observed in the spleen but not in liver
cells. We conclude that FISH is the method of choice to identify cross-sex
chimerism, especially when combined with morphological identification of nuclei
of different cell types, which will allow a targeted tissue-specific analysis.

Serum matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) as a biochemical marker for wasting
marmoset syndrome.

Saitama 351-0198, Japan.

Use of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) as a non-human primate
experimental animal has increased in recent years. Although wasting marmoset
syndrome (WMS) is one of the biggest problems in captive marmoset colonies, the
molecular mechanisms, biochemical markers for accurate diagnosis and a reliable
treatment remain unknown. In this study, as a first step to finding biochemical
marker(s) for the accurate diagnosis of WMS, we conducted blood cell counts,
including hematocrit, hemoglobin and platelets, and examined serum chemistry
values, including albumin, calcium and levels of serum matrix metalloproteinase 9
(MMP9), using a colony of marmosets with and without weight loss. MMP9 is thought
to be an enzyme responsible for the degradation of extracellular matrix
components and participates in the pathogenesis of inflammatory conditions, such 
as human and murine inflammatory bowel disease, which, like WMS, are
characterized histologically by inflammatory cell infiltrations in the
intestines. The values of hematocrit and hemoglobin and levels of serum albumin
and calcium in the WMS group were significantly decreased versus the control
group. The platelet values and serum MMP9 concentrations were increased
significantly in the WMS group compared with the control group. MMP9 could be a
new and useful marker for the diagnosis of WMS in addition to hematocrit,
hemoglobin, serum albumin and calcium. Our results also indicate that MMP9 could 
be a useful molecular candidate for treatment.

Recent developments in precision gene editing have led to the emergence of the
marmoset as an experimental subject of considerable interest and translational
value. A better understanding of behavioral phenotypes of the common marmoset
will inform the extent to which forthcoming transgenic mutants are cognitively
intact. Therefore, additional information regarding their learning, inhibitory
control, and motivational abilities is needed. The present studies used
touchscreen-based repeated acquisition and discrimination reversal tasks to
examine basic dimensions of learning and response inhibition. Marmosets were
trained daily to respond to one of the two simultaneously presented novel
stimuli. Subjects learned to discriminate the two stimuli (acquisition) and,
subsequently, with the contingencies switched (reversal). In addition,
progressive ratio performance was used to measure the effort expended to obtain a
highly palatable reinforcer varying in magnitude and, thereby, provide an index
of relative motivational value. Results indicate that rates of both acquisition
and reversal of novel discriminations increased across successive sessions, but
that rate of reversal learning remained slower than acquisition learning, i.e.,
more trials were needed for mastery. A positive correlation was observed between 
progressive ratio break point and reinforcement magnitude. These results closely 
replicate previous findings with squirrel monkeys, thus providing evidence of
similarity in learning processes across nonhuman primate species. Moreover, these
data provide key information about the normative phenotype of wild-type marmosets
using three relevant behavioral endpoints.

Primates tend to be long-lived for their size with humans being the longest lived
of all primates. There are compelling reasons to understand the underlying
age-related processes that shape human lifespan. But the very fact of our long
lifespan that makes it so compelling, also makes it especially difficult to
study. Thus, in studies of aging, researchers have turned to non-human primate
models, including chimpanzees, baboons, and rhesus macaques. More recently, the
common marmoset, Callithrix jacchus, has been recognized as a particularly
valuable model in studies of aging, given its small size, ease of housing in
captivity, and relatively short lifespan. However, little is known about the
physiological changes that occur as marmosets age. To begin to fill in this gap, 
we utilized high sensitivity metabolomics to define the longitudinal biochemical 
changes associated with age in the common marmoset. We measured 2104 metabolites 
from blood plasma at three separate time points over a 17-month period, and we
completed both a cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis of the metabolome. We 
discovered hundreds of metabolites associated with age and body weight in both
male and female animals. Our longitudinal analysis identified age-associated
metabolic pathways that were not found in our cross-sectional analysis. Pathways 
enriched for age-associated metabolites included tryptophan, nucleotide, and
xenobiotic metabolism, suggesting these biochemical pathways might play an
important role in the basic mechanisms of aging in primates. Moreover, we found
that many metabolic pathways associated with age were sex specific. Our work
illustrates the power of longitudinal approaches, even in a short time frame, to 
discover novel biochemical changes that occur with age.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a small-bodied, popular New World
monkey and is used widely in reproductive biology, neuroscience, and drug
development, due to its comparative ease of handling, high reproductive
efficiency, and its unique behavioral characters. In this review, we discuss the 
marmoset models in Parkinson's disease (PD), which is a neurological movement
disorder primarily resulting from a degeneration of dopaminergic neurons with
clinical features of tremor, rigidity, postural instability, and akinesia. The
most common PD models involve the administration of
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) or 6-hydroxydopamine to study
the pathogenesis and to evaluate novel therapies. Following the systemic or local
administration of these neurotoxins, the marmosets with very severe Parkinson's
symptoms are recommended to be placed in an intensive care unit with artificial
feeding to increase survival rate. All procedures with MPTP should be conducted
in a special room with enclosed cages under negative-pressure by trained
researchers with personal protection. Behavioral tests are conducted to provide
an external measure of the brain pathology. Along with several biomarkers,
including α-synuclein and DJ-1, non-invasive neuroimaging techniques such as
positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are used to evaluate 
the functional changes associated with PD. With the recent growing interest in
potential and novel therapies such as stem cell and gene therapy for PD in Korea,
the marmoset can be considered as a suitable non-human primate model in PD
research to bridge the gap between rodent studies and clinical applications.

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first identified in a
human with severe pneumonia in 2012. Since then, infections have been detected in
>1500 individuals, with disease severity ranging from asymptomatic to severe,
fatal pneumonia. To elucidate the pathogenesis of this virus and investigate
mechanisms underlying disease severity variation in the absence of autopsy data, 
a rhesus macaque and common marmoset model of MERS-CoV disease were analyzed.
Rhesus macaques developed mild disease, and common marmosets exhibited moderate
to severe, potentially lethal, disease. Both nonhuman primate species exhibited
respiratory clinical signs after inoculation, which were more severe and of
longer duration in the marmosets, and developed bronchointerstitial pneumonia. In
marmosets, the pneumonia was more extensive, with development of severe airway
lesions. Quantitative analysis showed significantly higher levels of pulmonary
neutrophil infiltration and higher amounts of pulmonary viral antigen in
marmosets. Pulmonary expression of the MERS-CoV receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4,
was similar in marmosets and macaques. These results suggest that increased virus
replication and the local immune response to MERS-CoV infection likely play a
role in pulmonary pathology severity. Together, the rhesus macaque and common
marmoset models of MERS-CoV span the wide range of disease severity reported in
MERS-CoV-infected humans, which will aid in investigating MERS-CoV disease
pathogenesis.

Sequencing the exposome: A call to action.

Jones DP(1).

Author information: 
(1)Department of Medicine, Emory University, Atlanta GA 30322 USA.

The exposome is a complement to the genome that includes non-genetic causes of
disease. Multiple definitions are available, with salient points being global
inclusion of exposures and behaviors, and cumulative integration of associated
biologic responses. As such, the concept is both refreshingly simple and
dauntingly complex. This article reviews high-resolution metabolomics (HRM) as an
affordable approach to routinely analyze samples for a broad spectrum of
environmental chemicals and biologic responses. HRM has been successfully used in
multiple exposome research paradigms and is suitable to implement in a prototype 
universal exposure surveillance system. Development of such a structure for
systematic monitoring of environmental exposures is an important step toward
sequencing the exposome because it builds upon successes of exposure science,
naturally connects external exposure to body burden and partitions the exposome
into workable components. Practical results would be repositories of quantitative
data on chemicals according to geography and biology. This would support new
opportunities for environmental health analysis and predictive modeling.
Complementary approaches to hasten development of exposome theory and associated 
biologic response networks could include experimental studies with model systems,
analysis of archival samples from longitudinal studies with outcome data and
study of relatively short-lived animals, such as household pets (dogs and cats)
and non-human primates (common marmoset). International investment and
cooperation to sequence the human exposome will advance scientific knowledge and 
also provide an important foundation to control adverse environmental exposures
to sustain healthy living spaces and improve prediction and management of
disease.

The perception of the pitch of harmonic complex sounds is a crucial function of
human audition, especially in music and speech processing. Whether the underlying
mechanisms of pitch perception are unique to humans, however, is unknown. Based
on estimates of frequency resolution at the level of the auditory periphery,
psychoacoustic studies in humans have revealed several primary features of
central pitch mechanisms. It has been shown that (i) pitch strength of a harmonic
tone is dominated by resolved harmonics; (ii) pitch of resolved harmonics is
sensitive to the quality of spectral harmonicity; and (iii) pitch of unresolved
harmonics is sensitive to the salience of temporal envelope cues. Here we show,
for a standard musical tuning fundamental frequency of 440 Hz, that the common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a New World monkey with a hearing range similar to
that of humans, exhibits all of the primary features of central pitch mechanisms 
demonstrated in humans. Thus, marmosets and humans may share similar pitch
perception mechanisms, suggesting that these mechanisms may have emerged early in
primate evolution.

Stem cell technologies are particularly attractive in Parkinson's disease (PD)
research although they occasionally need long-term treatment for
anti-parkinsonian activity. Unfortunately,
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) widely used as a model for PD
has several limitations, including the risk of dose-dependent mortality and the
difficulty of maintenance of PD symptoms during the whole experiment period.
Therefore, we tested if our novel MPTP regimen protocol (2 mg/kg for 2
consecutive days and 1 mg/kg for next 3 consecutive days) can be maintained
stable parkinsonism without mortality for long-term stem cell therapy. For this, 
we used small-bodied common marmoset monkeys (Callithrix jacchus) among several
nonhuman primates showing high anatomical, functional, and behavioral
similarities to humans. Along with no mortality, the behavioral changes involved 
in PD symptoms were maintained for 32 weeks. Also, the loss of jumping ability of
the MPTP-treated marmosets in the Tower test was not recovered by 32 weeks.
Positron emission tomography (PET) analysis revealed that remarkable decreases of
bindings of 18F-FP-CIT were observed at the striatum of the brains of the
marmosets received MPTP during the full period of the experiment for 32 weeks. In
the substantia nigra of the marmosets, the loss of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)
immunoreactivity was also observed at 32 weeks following the MPTP treatment. In
conclusion, our low-dose MPTP regimen protocol was found to be stable
parkinsonism without mortality as evidenced by behavior, PET, and TH
immunohistochemistry. This result will be useful for evaluation of possible
long-term stem cell therapy for anti-parkinsonian activity.

Mirror neurons respond when executing a motor act and when observing others'
similar act. So far, mirror neurons have been found only in macaques, humans, and
songbirds. To investigate the degree of phylogenetic specialization of mirror
neurons during the course of their evolution, we determined whether mirror
neurons with similar properties to macaques occur in a New World monkey, the
common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). The ventral premotor cortex (PMv), where
mirror neurons have been reported in macaques, is difficult to identify in
marmosets, since no sulcal landmarks exist in the frontal cortex. We addressed
this problem using "in vivo" connection imaging methods. That is, we first
identified cells responsive to others' grasping action in a clear landmark, the
superior temporal sulcus (STS), under anesthesia, and injected fluorescent
tracers into the region. By fluorescence stereomicroscopy, we identified clusters
of labeled cells in the ventrolateral frontal cortex, which were confirmed to be 
within the ventrolateral frontal cortex including PMv after sacrifice. We next
implanted electrodes into the ventrolateral frontal cortex and STS and recorded
single/multi-units under an awake condition. As a result, we found neurons in the
ventrolateral frontal cortex with characteristic "mirror" properties quite
similar to those in macaques. This finding suggests that mirror neurons occur in 
a common ancestor of New and Old World monkeys and its common properties are
preserved during the course of primate evolution.

We use the common marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus) as a preclinical nonhuman 
primate model to study reproductive and stem cell biology. The neonatal marmoset 
monkey ovary contains numerous primitive premeiotic germ cells (oogonia)
expressing pluripotent stem cell markers including OCT4A (POU5F1). This is a
peculiarity compared to neonatal human and rodent ovaries. Here, we aimed at
culturing marmoset oogonia from neonatal ovaries. We established a culture system
being stable for more than 20 passages and 5 months. Importantly, comparative
transcriptome analysis of the cultured cells with neonatal ovary, embryonic stem 
cells, and fibroblasts revealed a lack of germ cell and pluripotency genes
indicating the complete loss of oogonia upon initiation of the culture. From
passage 4 onwards, however, the cultured cells produced large spherical,
free-floating cells resembling oocyte-like cells (OLCs). OLCs strongly expressed 
several germ cell genes and may derive from the ovarian surface epithelium. In
summary, our novel primate ovarian cell culture initially lacked detectable germ 
cells but then produced OLCs over a long period of time. This culture system may 
allow a deeper analysis of early phases of female primate germ cell development
and-after significant refinement-possibly also the production of monkey oocytes.

Two-photon imaging with genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) enables
long-term observation of neuronal activity in vivo. However, there are very few
studies of GECIs in primates. Here, we report a method for long-term imaging of a
GECI, GCaMP6f, expressed from adeno-associated virus vectors in cortical neurons 
of the adult common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a small New World primate. We 
used a tetracycline-inducible expression system to robustly amplify neuronal
GCaMP6f expression and up- and downregulate it for more than 100 days. We
succeeded in monitoring spontaneous activity not only from hundreds of neurons
three-dimensionally distributed in layers 2 and 3 but also from single dendrites 
and axons in layer 1. Furthermore, we detected selective activities from somata, 
dendrites, and axons in the somatosensory cortex responding to specific tactile
stimuli. Our results provide a way to investigate the organization and plasticity
of cortical microcircuits at subcellular resolution in non-human primates.

The synaptic protein α-synuclein has been identified as a major component of Lewy
bodies, a pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD). Prior to the
formation of Lewy bodies, mislocalization and aggregation of the α-synuclein in
brain tissue is frequently observed in various neurodegenerative diseases.
Aberrant accumulation and localization of α-synuclein are also observed in the
aging human brain, for which reason aging is regarded as a risk factor for
neurodegenerative disease. To investigate changes in α-synuclein properties in
the aging brain, we compared α-synuclein immunoreactivity in brain tissue of
young (2-years-old) and middle-aged (6-years-old) common marmoset (Callithrix
jacchus). Our analyses revealed marked changes in α-synuclein immunoreactivity in
the olfactory bulb of common marmosets of these age cohorts. Perikaryal
α-synuclein aggregations were formed in the olfactory bulb in middle-aged
animals. We also observed signals of α-synuclein accumulation in hippocampus in
this cohort; however, unlike in the olfactory bulb, hippocampal α-synuclein
signals were localized in the synaptic terminals. We did not observe either of
these features in younger marmosets, which suggest that aging may play a role in 
these phenomena. Our results using common marmoset brain corresponded with the
observation that the α-synuclein aggregations were first occurred from olfactory 
bulb in human normal aged and PD brain. Therefore, common marmoset is expected as
useful model for α-synuclein pathology.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a highly vocal New World primate
species, has emerged in recent years as a promising animal model for studying
brain mechanisms underlying perception, vocal production, and cognition. The
present study provides a quantitative acoustic analysis of a large number of
vocalizations produced by marmosets in a social environment within a captive
colony. Previous classifications of the marmoset vocal repertoire were mostly
based on qualitative observations. In the present study a variety of
vocalizations from individually identified marmosets were sampled and multiple
acoustic features of each type of vocalization were measured. Results show that
marmosets have a complex vocal repertoire in captivity that consists of multiple 
vocalization types, including both simple calls and compound calls composed of
sequences of simple calls. A detailed quantification of the vocal repertoire of
the marmoset can serve as a solid basis for studying the behavioral significance 
of their vocalizations and is essential for carrying out studies that investigate
such properties as perceptual boundaries between call types and among individual 
callers as well as neural coding mechanisms for vocalizations. It can also serve 
as the basis for evaluating abnormal vocal behaviors resulting from diseases or
genetic manipulations.

The first draft of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) genome was published 
by the Marmoset Genome Sequencing and Analysis Consortium. The draft was based on
whole-genome shotgun sequencing, and the current assembly version is
Callithrix_jacches-3.2.1, but there still exist 187,214 undetermined gap regions 
and supercontigs and relatively short contigs that are unmapped to chromosomes in
the draft genome. We performed resequencing and assembly of the genome of common 
marmoset by deep sequencing with high-throughput sequencing technology. Several
different sequence runs using Illumina sequencing platforms were executed, and
181 Gbp of high-quality bases including mate-pairs with long insert lengths of 3,
8, 20, and 40 Kbp were obtained, that is, approximately 60× coverage. The
resequencing significantly improved the MGSAC draft genome sequence. The N50 of
the contigs, which is a statistical measure used to evaluate assembly quality,
doubled. As a result, 51% of the contigs (total length: 299 Mbp) that were
unmapped to chromosomes in the MGSAC draft were merged with chromosomal contigs, 
and the improved genome sequence helped to detect 5,288 new genes that are
homologous to human cDNAs and the gaps in 5,187 transcripts of the Ensembl gene
annotations were completely filled.

High-resolution metabolomics has created opportunity to integrate nutrition and
metabolism into genetic studies to improve understanding of the diverse radiation
of primate species. At present, however, there is very little information to help
guide experimental design for study of wild populations. In a previous
non-targeted metabolomics study of common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus), Rhesus 
macaques, humans, and four non-primate mammalian species, we found that essential
amino acids (AA) and other central metabolites had interspecies variation similar
to intraspecies variation while non-essential AA, environmental chemicals and
catabolic waste products had greater interspecies variation. The present study
was designed to test whether 55 plasma metabolites, including both nutritionally 
essential and non-essential metabolites and catabolic products, differ in
concentration in common marmosets and humans. Significant differences were
present for more than half of the metabolites analyzed and included AA, vitamins 
and central lipid metabolites, as well as for catabolic products of AA,
nucleotides, energy metabolism and heme. Three environmental chemicals were
present at low nanomolar concentrations but did not differ between species. Sex
and age differences in marmosets were present for AA and nucleotide metabolism
and warrant additional study. Overall, the results suggest that quantitative,
targeted metabolomics can provide a useful complement to non-targeted
metabolomics for studies of diet and environment interactions in primate
evolution.

Rapamycin has been shown to extend lifespan in rodent models, but the effects on 
metabolic health and function have been widely debated in both clinical and
translational trials. Prior to rapamycin being used as a treatment to extend both
lifespan and healthspan in the human population, it is vital to assess the side
effects of the treatment on metabolic pathways in animal model systems, including
a closely related non-human primate model. In this study, we found that long-term
treatment of marmoset monkeys with orally-administered encapsulated rapamycin
resulted in no overall effects on body weight and only a small decrease in fat
mass over the first few months of treatment. Rapamycin treated subjects showed no
overall changes in daily activity counts, blood lipids, or significant changes in
glucose metabolism including oral glucose tolerance. Adipose tissue displayed no 
differences in gene expression of metabolic markers following treatment, while
liver tissue exhibited suppressed G6Pase activity with increased PCK and GPI
activity. Overall, the marmosets revealed only minor metabolic consequences of
chronic treatment with rapamycin and this adds to the growing body of literature 
that suggests that chronic and/or intermittent rapamycin treatment results in
improved health span and metabolic functioning. The marmosets offer an
interesting alternative animal model for future intervention testing and
translational modeling.

Spermatogonia are specialized cells responsible for continuous spermatogenesis
and the production of offspring. Because of this biological property, in vitro
culture of spermatogonia provides a powerful methodology to advance reproductive 
biology and engineering. However, methods for culturing primate spermatogonia are
poorly established. We have designed a novel method for culturing spermatogonia
in the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a small primate. By using our method
with a suite of growth factors, adult marmoset testis-derived germ cells could be
cultured in the form of a floating sphere for several weeks. Notably, this method
could be applied not only to freshly isolated cells but also to cryopreserved
cell stocks. The spheres enriched spermatogonia and early spermatocytes, and
could be assembled from a C-KIT(+) spermatogonial population. Techniques for
culturing spermatogonia could facilitate increased understanding of primate
reproduction as well as the preservation of valuable biomaterials from nonhuman
primates.

The number of studies that use the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) in
various fields of neurosciences is increasing dramatically. In general, animals
enter the study when their health status is considered satisfactory on the basis 
of classical clinical investigations. In behavioral studies, variations of score 
between individuals are frequently observed, some of them being considered as
poor performers or outliers. Experimenters rarely consider the fact that it could
be related to some brain anomaly. This raises the important issue of the
reliability of such classical behavioral approaches without using complementary
imaging, especially in animals lacking striking external clinical signs. Here we 
report the case of a young marmoset which presented a set of cognitive
impairments in two different tasks compared to other age-matched animals. Brain
imaging revealed a patent right lateral ventricular enlargement with a mild
hippocampal atrophy. This abnormality could explain the cognitive impairments of 
this animal. Such a case points to the importance of complementing behavioral
studies by imaging explorations to avoid experimental bias.

Cortical areas in the superior temporal sulcus (STS) of primates have been
recognized as a part of the 'social brain'. In particular, biological motion
stimuli elicit neuronal responses in the STS, indicating their roles in the
ability to understand others' actions. However, the spatial organization of
functionally identified STS cells is not well understood because it is difficult 
to identify the precise locations of cells in sulcal regions. Here, using a small
New World monkey, the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) that has a
lissencephalic brain, we investigated the spatial organization of the cells
responsive to other's actions in STS. The neural responses to movies showing
several types of other's actions were recorded with multicontact linear-array
electrodes that had four shanks (0.4 mm spacing), with eight electrode contacts
(0.2 mm spacing) for each shank. The four shanks were penetrated perpendicular to
the cortical surface. We found that STS cells significantly responded to other's 
goal-directed actions, such as when an actor marmoset was reaching for and
grasping a piece of food. The response profiles to the movies were more similar
between the vertically positioned electrodes than horizontally positioned
electrodes when the distances between electrodes were matched. This indicates
that there are functional columns in the higher-order visual areas in STS of the 
common marmoset.

Previous studies have shown that a major block to HIV-1 replication in common
marmosets operates at the level of viral entry and that this block can be
overcome by adaptation of the virus in tissue-cultured cells. However, our
current studies indicate that HIV-1 encounters additional postentry blocks in
common marmoset peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Here, we show that the common
marmoset APOBEC3G (A3G) and BST2 proteins block HIV-1 in cell cultures. Using a
directed-evolution method that takes advantage of the natural ability of HIV-1 to
mutate during replication, we have been able to overcome these blocks in
tissue-cultured cells. In the adapted viruses, specific changes were observed in 
gag, vif, env, and nef. The contribution of these changes to virus replication in
the presence of the A3G and BST2 restriction factors was studied. We found that
certain amino acid changes in Vif and Env that arise during adaptation to
marmoset A3G and BST2 allow the virus to replicate in the presence of these
restriction factors. The changes in Vif reduce expression levels and
encapsidation of marmoset APOBEC3G, while the changes in Env increase viral
fitness and discretely favor cell-to-cell transmission of the virus, allowing
viral escape from these restriction factors.IMPORTANCE: HIV-1 can infect only
humans and chimpanzees. The main reason for this narrow tropism is the presence
in many species of dominant-acting factors, known as restriction factors, that
block viral replication in a species-specific way. We have been exploring the
blocks to HIV-1 in common marmosets, with the ultimate goal of developing a new
animal model of HIV-1 infection in these monkeys. In this study, we observed that
common marmoset APOBEC3G and BST2, two known restriction factors, are able to
block HIV-1 in cell cultures. We have adapted HIV-1 to replicate in the presence 
of these restriction factors and have characterized the mechanisms of escape.
These studies can help in the development of a novel animal model for in vivo
infection of marmosets with HIV-1-like viruses.

1. 3-N-Demethylation of caffeine (1,3,7-trimethylxanthine) is mediated by human
cytochrome P450 1A2, whereas 7-N-demethylation and C-8-hydroxylation are
reportedly catalyzed by monkey P450 2C9 and rat P450 1A2, respectively. 2. Roles 
of marmoset P450 enzymes in caffeine oxidation were investigated using nine
marmoset liver microsomes and 14 recombinantly expressed marmoset P450 enzymes.
3. Predominant caffeine 7-N-demethylation and C-8-hydroxylation activities in
marmoset liver microsomes were moderately (r = 0.78, p < 0.05) and highly
(r = 0.82, p < 0.01) correlated with midazolam 1'-hydroxylation activities,
respectively, while the former was not strongly affected by ketoconazole or
α-naphthoflavone. 4. Caffeine C-8-hydroxylation in liver microsomes was inhibited
by ketoconazole and activated by α-naphthoflavone, suggesting main involvements
of P450 3As. 5. Recombinant marmoset P450 3As had high Vmax/Km values for
C-8-hydroxylation, comparable to Km values for marmoset liver microsomes.
Marmoset P450 1As efficiently mediated caffeine 3-N-demethylation and
C-8-hydroxylation with apparently lower Km values than those of liver microsomes.
6. These results collectively suggest highly active marmoset P450 3A enzymes
toward caffeine 8-hydorxylaiton and involvement of multiple P450 isoforms
including P450 1A in caffeine 7-N- and 3-N-demethylations in marmoset livers.
Marmoset P450s have slightly different properties to human or monkey P450s
regarding caffeine metabolic pathways.

Molecular Cloning, Tissue Distribution, and Functional Characterization of
Marmoset Cytochrome P450 1A1, 1A2, and 1B1.

Erratum in
    Drug Metab Dispos. 2017 Aug;45(8):956.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a New World monkey, has potential to be
an animal model for drug metabolism studies. In this study, we identified and
characterized cytochrome P450 (P450) 1A1 and 1B1 in addition to the known P450
1A2 in marmosets. Marmoset P450 1A1 and 1B1 cDNA contained open reading frames
encoding 512 and 543 amino acids, respectively, with high sequence identities
(90%-93%) to other primate P450 1A1s and 1B1s. A phylogenetic tree based on amino
acid sequences showed close evolutionary relationships among marmoset, macaque,
and human P450 1A and 1B enzymes. By mRNA quantification and immunoblot analyses 
in five marmoset tissues, P450 1A1 was mainly expressed in lungs and small
intestines, and P450 1A2 was expressed predominantly in livers. In contrast, P450
1B1 was expressed in all tissues tested. Marmoset P450 1A1, 1A2, and 1B1
heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli catalyzed 7-ethoxyresorufin
O-deethylation, 7-ethoxycoumarin O-deethylation, and phenacetin O-deethylation,
similar to those of humans and cynomolgus monkeys. Notably, marmoset P450 1A1 and
1A2 more efficiently catalyzed 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylation than those of the
human homologs, but were comparable to those of the cynomolgus monkey homologs.
Additionally, marmoset P450 1B1 preferentially catalyzed estradiol
4-hydroxylation; however, rat P450 1B1 more favorably catalyzed estradiol
2-hydroxylation, indicating that the estradiol hydroxylation specificity of
marmoset P450 1B1 was similar to those of human and cynomolgus monkey P450 1B1.
These results indicated that marmoset P450 1A and 1B enzymes had functional
characteristics similar to those of humans and cynomolgus monkeys, suggesting
that P450 1A and 1B-dependent metabolism was similar among marmosets, cynomolgus 
monkeys, and humans.

Common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) monkeys are a resource for biomedical
research and their use is predicted to increase due to the suitability of this
species for transgenic approaches. Identification of abnormal neurodevelopment
due to genetic modification relies upon the comparison with validated patterns of
normal behavior defined by unbiased methods. As scientists unfamiliar with
nonhuman primate development are interested to apply genomic editing techniques
in marmosets, it would be beneficial to the field that the investigators use
validated methods of postnatal evaluation that are age and species appropriate.
This review aims to analyze current available data on marmoset physical and
behavioral postnatal development, describe the methods used and discuss next
steps to better understand and evaluate marmoset normal and abnormal postnatal
neurodevelopment.

Oxidative stress is implicated in various pathological conditions of the retina
and optic nerve. Peroxiredoxins (Prdxs) comprise a recently characterized family 
of antioxidant enzymes. To date, little information exists regarding the
distribution of Prdxs in the eye. Herein, we employed a combination of qRT-PCR,
immunohistochemistry and Western blotting to determine the level of expression
and distribution of the six Prdx isoforms in the retina and optic nerve of the
rat. In addition, we performed some parallel analyses on the common marmoset
(Callithrix Jacchus). In the rat, all of the Prdx transcripts were expressed in
relatively high amounts in both retina and optic nerve, with abundances ranging
from approximately 3-50 % of the level of the housekeeping gene cyclophilin. With
regard to protein expression, each isoform was detected in the retina and optic
nerve by either Western blotting and/or immunohistochemistry. Excepting Prdx4,
there was a good correspondence between the rodent and primate results. In the
retina, Prdx1 and Prdx2 were principally localized to neurons in the inner
nuclear layer and cone photoreceptors, Prdx3 and Prdx5 displayed characteristic
mitochondrial immunolabeling, while Prdx6 was associated with astrocytes and
Müller cells. In the optic nerve, Prdx1 was robustly expressed by
oligodendrocytes, Prdx3 and Prdx5 were observed in axons, and Prdx6 was
restricted to astrocytes. The present findings augment our understanding of the
distribution and expression of the Prdxs in the retina and optic nerve of rodents
and primates and lay the foundation for subsequent analysis of their involvement 
in relevant blinding diseases.

Can vocal conditioning trigger a semiotic ratchet in marmosets?

Turesson HK(1), Ribeiro S(1).

Author information: 
(1)Brain Institute, Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte , Natal, Brazil.

The complexity of human communication has often been taken as evidence that our
language reflects a true evolutionary leap, bearing little resemblance to any
other animal communication system. The putative uniqueness of the human language 
poses serious evolutionary and ethological challenges to a rational explanation
of human communication. Here we review ethological, anatomical, molecular, and
computational results across several species to set boundaries for these
challenges. Results from animal behavior, cognitive psychology, neurobiology, and
semiotics indicate that human language shares multiple features with other
primate communication systems, such as specialized brain circuits for
sensorimotor processing, the capability for indexical (pointing) and symbolic
(referential) signaling, the importance of shared intentionality for associative 
learning, affective conditioning and parental scaffolding of vocal production.
The most substantial differences lie in the higher human capacity for symbolic
compositionality, fast vertical transmission of new symbols across generations,
and irreversible accumulation of novel adaptive behaviors (cultural ratchet). We 
hypothesize that increasingly-complex vocal conditioning of an appropriate animal
model may be sufficient to trigger a semiotic ratchet, evidenced by progressive
sign complexification, as spontaneous contact calls become indexes, then symbols 
and finally arguments (strings of symbols). To test this hypothesis, we outline a
series of conditioning experiments in the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).
The experiments are designed to probe the limits of vocal communication in a
prosocial, highly vocal primate 35 million years far from the human lineage, so
as to shed light on the mechanisms of semiotic complexification and cultural
transmission, and serve as a naturalistic behavioral setting for the
investigation of language disorders.

Cryopreservation is a technique that has been extensively used for storage of
multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) in regenerative medicine. Therefore,
improving current cryopreservation procedures in terms of increasing cell
viability and functionality is important. In this study, we optimized the
cryopreservation protocol of MSCs derived from the common marmoset Callithrix
jacchus (cj), which can be used as a non-human primate model in various
pathological and transplantation studies and have a great potential for
regenerative medicine. We have investigated the effect of the active control of
the nucleation temperature using induced nucleation at a broad range of
temperatures and two different dimethylsulfoxide concentrations (Me2SO, 5% (v/v) 
and 10%, (v/v)) to evaluate the overall effect on the viability, metabolic
activity and recovery of cells after thawing. Survival rate and metabolic
activity displayed an optimum when ice formation was induced at -10 °C.
Cryomicroscopy studies indicated differences in ice crystal morphologies as well 
as differences in intracellular ice formation with different nucleation
temperatures. High subzero nucleation temperatures resulted in larger
extracellular ice crystals and cellular dehydration, whereas low subzero
nucleation temperatures resulted in smaller ice crystals and intracellular ice
formation.

Parental experience and hormones play a large role in the common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus) father's care of their offspring. We tested the effect of
exogenous estradiol or testosterone on the responsiveness of common marmosets to 
respond to infant distress vocalizations and whether males who haven't become
fathers yet (paired males) would have increased responsiveness to infant distress
calls with either steroid or whether parental experience is the most important
component for the onset of paternal care. Sixteen male marmosets (8 fathers, 8
paired males) received a vehicle, low dose or high dose of estradiol and
additional 16 males were tested with testosterone at three doses for their
response either to a vocal control or a recording of an infant distress call for 
10min. Without steroid stimulation fathers were significantly more likely to
respond to the infant distress stimulus than paired males. Low dose estradiol
stimulation resulted in a significant increase in fathers' behavioral response
towards the infant distress stimulus but not in paired males. Fathers also showed
a significant increase in infant responsiveness from the vehicle dose to the
estradiol low dose treatment, but not to the estradiol high dose treatment.
Testosterone treatment did not show significant differences between infant
responsiveness at either dose and between fathers and paired males. We suggest
that neither steroid is involved in the onset of paternal care behaviors in the
marmoset but that estradiol may be involved in facilitating paternal motivation
in experienced fathers.

Working memory is used to solve various cognitive problems by maintaining
information for some time and then by refreshing this information after certain
purposes are achieved. In the present study, we explored the ability of common
marmosets to perform a delayed matching to position (DMTP) task in a controlled
environment using operant conditioning. The DMTP task requires the subjects to
respond to the sample stimulus and to select one of two comparison stimuli with a
position matching that of the sample stimulus after a programmed delay period.
Positional arrangement of the sample and comparison stimuli, which were
quasi-randomly determined in each trial, was employed to prevent the subjects
from using any strategies based on their own body positions or orientations. The 
delay intervals between presentations of the sample and comparison stimuli were
fixed at 0.5 and 1s in the initial phases and were then varied between 5
intervals per delay set (e.g., 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8s) intermixed in a session. The
longest delay interval within a set was gradually increased after the marmosets
achieved the criterion of each task. The subjects were successfully trained in
the procedure and showed accurate performance even following delays of more than 
100 s. The response times in the trials suggested that they used different
strategies depending on the delay interval length. Thus, the present study shows 
the robust ability of common marmosets in a task requiring positional memory,
which is related to their foraging strategy observed in the wild.

The adenosine A2A receptor antagonist, istradefylline improves motor function in 
patients with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) optimally treated with a
combination of L-DOPA and a dopamine agonist without increasing the risk of
troublesome dyskinesia. However, the effects of istradefylline on motor function 
when administered in combination with low dose of L-DOPA and dopamine agonists as
occurs in early PD are unknown. We investigated whether istradefylline enhances
the combined anti-parkinsonian effects of a suboptimal dose of L-DOPA and a
threshold dose of either the non-ergot dopamine agonist, ropinirole or the ergot 
dopamine agonist, pergolide in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine
(MPTP)-treated common marmoset. Threshold doses of ropinirole (0.025-0.075 mg/kg 
p.o.) and pergolide (0.01 mg/kg p.o.) produced a weak anti-parkinsonian effect.
Co-administration of a suboptimal dose of L-DOPA (2.5mg/kg p.o.) with threshold
doses of the dopamine agonists enhanced their anti-parkinsonian effect that led
to increased 'ON' time without dyskinesia appearing. Administering istradefylline
(10mg/kg p.o.) with the threshold doses of dopamine agonists and the suboptimal
dose of L-DOPA in a triple combination caused a further enhancement of the
anti-parkinsonian response but dyskinesia was still absent. In early PD, dopamine
agonists are often used as first-line monotherapy, but efficacy is usually lost
within a few years, at which time L-DOPA is added but with the risk of dyskinesia
appearance. These results show that istradefylline is effective in improving
motor function in combination with low dose dopaminergic drug treatment without
provoking dyskinesia.

BACKGROUND: Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in the common
marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus) is a relevant preclinical model for
translational research into immunopathogenic mechanisms operating in multiple
sclerosis (MS). Prior studies showed a core pathogenic role of T and B cells
specific for myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG). However, in those
studies, the quality of the response against MOG epitopes was strongly biased by 
bacterial antigens in the complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA), in which the
immunizing recombinant human (rh) MOG protein had been formulated. In response to
the need of a more refined EAE model, we have tested whether disease could also
be induced with rhMOG in incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA).
METHOD: Marmosets were immunized with rhMOG emulsified in IFA in the dorsal skin.
Monkeys that did not develop neurological deficit were given booster
immunizations at 28-day interval with the same antigen preparation. In a second
experiment, three marmoset twin pairs were sensitized against MOG peptides in IFA
to study a possibility for suppressive activity towards pathogenic T cells
directed against the encephalitogenic epitope MOG40-48.
RESULTS: Despite the absence of strong danger signals in the rhMOG/IFA inoculum, 
all monkeys developed clinically evident EAE symptoms. Moreover, in all monkeys, 
demyelinated lesions were present in the white matter and in two cases also in
the cortical grey matter. Immune profiling at height of the disease showed a
dominant T cell response against the overlapping peptides 14-36 and 24-46, but
reactivity against the pathogenically most relevant peptide 34-56 was
conspicuously absent. In the second experiment, there was an indication for a
possible suppressive mechanism.
CONCLUSIONS: Immunization of marmoset monkeys with rhMOG in IFA elicits clinical 
EAE in all animals. Moreover, rhMOG contains pathogenic and regulatory epitopes, 
but the pathogenic hierarchy of rhMOG epitopes is strongly influenced by the
adjuvant in which the protein is formulated.

The common marmoset has been increasingly used for research in the biomedical
field; however, there is little information available regarding effective methods
of anesthesia in this species. This study retrospectively analyzed 2 regimens of 
anesthesia induction: intramuscular injection of ketamine followed by inhalation 
of 5% sevoflurane, and intramuscular injection of midazolam, butorphanol and
ketamine followed by inhalation of 5% sevoflurane. Anesthetic depth did not reach
the surgical anesthesia stage in 7 out of 99 animals receiving the former
regimen, whereas there were only 2 such animals out of 273 receiving the latter
regimen. The latter regimen, when followed by maintenance anesthesia with 3%
sevoflurane inhalation, was successfully used in various nociceptive procedures. 
These results indicate that the injection of a combination of midazolam,
butorphanol and ketamine followed by inhalation of a high concentration of
sevoflurane is effective for anesthesia induction in marmosets.

INTRODUCTION: Multipotent stromal cells (MSCs) are among the key candidates in
regenerative medicine. However variety of MSC sources and general heterogeneity
lead to controversial data in functional characterization. Furthermore, despite
intensive usage as preclinical animal model, little is known about MSCs of the
common marmoset monkey.
METHODS: MSCs derived from placental amnion and bone marrow samples from human
and common marmoset were characterized in parallel over 12 passages to monitor
similarities and significant differences (p ≤ 0.05, Student's t-test) in MSC
markers and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I expression by
immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, real-time PCR, metabolic activity test,
with special focus on pluripotency associated genes.
RESULTS: Human and non-human primate MSCs were characterized for expression of
MSC markers and capability of differentiation into mesenchymal lineages. MSCs
could be cultured more than 100 days (26 passages), but metabolic activity was
significantly enhanced in amnion vs. bone marrow MSCs. Interestingly, MHC class I
expression is significantly reduced in amnion MSCs until passage 6 in human and
marmoset, but not in bone marrow cells. For MSC markers, CD73 and CD105 levels
remain unchanged in amnion MSCs and slightly decline in bone marrow at late
passages; CD166 is significantly higher expressed in human MSCs, CD106
significantly lower vs. marmoset. All cultured MSCs showed pluripotency marker
expression like Oct-4A at passage 3 significantly decreasing over time (passages 
6-12) while Nanog expression was highest in human bone marrow MSCs. Furthermore, 
human MSCs demonstrated the highest Sox2 levels vs. marmoset, whereas the
marmoset exhibited significantly higher Lin28A values. Bisulfite sequencing of
the Oct-4 promoter region displayed fewer methylations of CpG islands in the
marmoset vs. human.
CONCLUSIONS: Little is known about MSC characteristics from the preclinical
animal model common marmoset vs. human during long term culture. Studied human
and common marmoset samples share many similar features such as most MSC markers 
and reduced MHC class I expression in amnion cells vs. bone marrow. Furthermore, 
pluripotency markers indicate in both species a subpopulation of MSCs with true
'stemness', which could explain their high proliferation capacity, though
possessing differences between human and marmoset in Lin28A and Sox2 expression.

Previous studies have demonstrated that patients with schizophrenia show greater 
sensitivity to psychostimulants than healthy subjects. Sensitization to
psychostimulants and resultant alteration of dopaminergic neurotransmission in
rodents has been suggested as a useful model of schizophrenia. This study sought 
to examine the use of methylphenidate as a psychostimulant to induce dopamine
release and that of [(18)F]fallypride as a radioligand to quantify the release in
a primate model of schizophrenia. Four common marmosets were scanned by positron 
emission tomography twice, before and after methylphenidate challenge, to
evaluate dopamine release. Four other marmosets were sensitized by repeated
methamphetamine (MAP) administration. Then, they were scanned twice, before and
after methylphenidate challenge, to evaluate whether MAP-sensitization induced
greater sensitivity to methylphenidate. We revealed a main effect of the
methylphenidate challenge but not the MAP pretreatment on the striatal binding
potential. These results suggest that methylphenidate-induced striatal dopamine
release in the common marmoset could be evaluated by [(18)F]fallypride.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a small New World monkey, has the
potential for use in human drug development due to its evolutionary closeness to 
humans. Four novel cDNAs, encoding cytochrome P450 (P450) 2C18, 2C19, 2C58, and
2C76, were cloned from marmoset livers to characterize P450 2C molecular
properties, including previously reported P450 2C8. The deduced amino acid
sequence showed high sequence identities (>86%) with those of human P450 2Cs,
except for marmoset P450 2C76, which has a low sequence identity (∼70%) with any 
human P450 2Cs. Phylogenetic analysis showed that marmoset P450 2Cs were more
closely clustered with those of humans and macaques than other species
investigated. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that all of 
the marmoset P450 2C mRNAs were predominantly expressed in liver as opposed to
the other tissues tested. Marmoset P450 2C proteins were detected in liver by
immunoblotting using antibodies against human P450 2Cs. Among marmoset P450 2Cs
heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli, marmoset P450 2C19 efficiently
catalyzed human P450 2C substrates, S-warfarin, diclofenac, tolbutamide,
flurbiprofen, and omeprazole. Marmoset P450 2C19 had high Vmax and low Km values 
for S-warfarin 7-hydroxylation that were comparable to those in human liver
microsomes, indicating warfarin stereoselectivity similar to findings in humans. 
Faster in vivo S-warfarin clearance than R-warfarin after intravenous
administration of racemic warfarin (0.2 mg/kg) to marmosets was consistent with
the in vitro kinetic parameters. These results indicated that marmoset P450 2C
enzymes had functional characteristics similar to those of humans, and that P450 
2C-dependent metabolic properties are likewise similar between marmosets and
humans.

Lymphocytes express potassium channels that regulate physiological cell
functions, such as activation, proliferation and migration. Expression levels of 
K2P5.1 (TASK2; KCNK5) channels belonging to the family of two-pore domain
potassium channels have previously been correlated to the activity of
autoreactive T lymphocytes in patients with multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid
arthritis. In humans, K2P5.1 channels are upregulated upon T cell stimulation and
influence T cell effector functions. However, a further clinical translation of
targeting K2P5.1 is currently hampered by a lack of highly selective inhibitors, 
making it necessary to evaluate the impact of KCNK5 in established preclinical
animal disease models. We here demonstrate that K2P5.1 knockout (K2P5.1-/-) mice 
display no significant alterations concerning T cell cytokine production,
proliferation rates, surface marker molecules or signaling pathways. In an
experimental model of autoimmune neuroinflammation, K2P5.1-/- mice show a
comparable disease course to wild-type animals and no major changes in the
peripheral immune system or CNS compartment. A compensatory upregulation of the
potassium channels K2P3.1 and KV1.3 seems to counterbalance the deletion of
K2P5.1. As an alternative model mimicking autoimmune neuroinflammation,
experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in the common marmoset has been
proposed, especially for testing the efficacy of new potential drugs. Initial
experiments show that K2P5.1 is functionally expressed on marmoset T lymphocytes,
opening up the possibility for assessing future K2P5.1-targeting drugs.

Ebola virus (EBOV) causes a highly infectious and lethal hemorrhagic fever in
primates with high fatality rates during outbreaks and EBOV may be exploited as a
potential biothreat pathogen. There is therefore a need to develop and license
appropriate medical countermeasures against this virus. To determine whether the 
common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) would be an appropriate model to assess
vaccines or therapies against EBOV disease (EVD), initial susceptibility,
lethality and pathogenesis studies were performed. Low doses of EBOV-Kikwit,
between 4 and 27 times the 50% tissue culture infectious dose, were sufficient to
cause a lethal, reproducible infection. Animals became febrile between days 5 and
6, maintaining a high fever before succumbing to EVD between 6 and 8 days after
challenge. Typical signs of EVD were observed. Pathogenesis studies revealed that
virus was isolated from the lungs of animals beginning on day 3 after challenge
and from the liver, spleen and blood beginning on day 5. The most striking
features were observed in animals that succumbed to infection, including high
viral titers in all organs, increased levels of liver function enzymes and blood 
clotting times, decreased levels of platelets, multifocal moderate to severe
hepatitis, and perivascular edema.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common cause for sustained disability in
young adults, yet treatment options remain very limited. Although numerous
therapeutic approaches have been effective in rodent models of experimental
autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), only few proved to be beneficial in patients 
with MS. Hence, there is a strong need for more predictive animal models. Within 
the past decade, EAE in the common marmoset evolved as a potent, alternative
model for MS, with immunological and pathological features resembling more
closely the human disease. However, an often very rapid and severe disease course
hampers its implementation for systematic testing of new treatment strategies. We
here developed a new focal model of EAE in the common marmoset, induced by myelin
oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) immunization and stereotactic injections of
proinflammatory cytokines. At the injection site of cytokines, confluent
inflammatory demyelinating lesions developed that strongly resembled human MS
lesions. In a proof-of-principle treatment study with the immunomodulatory
compound laquinimod, we demonstrate that targeted EAE in marmosets provides a
promising and valid tool for preclinical experimental treatment trials in MS
research.

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) causes severe disease in 
human with an overall case-fatality rate of >35%. Effective antivirals are
crucial for improving the clinical outcome of MERS. Although a number of
repurposed drugs, convalescent-phase plasma, antiviral peptides, and neutralizing
antibodies exhibit anti-MERS-CoV activity in vitro, most are not readily
available or have not been evaluated in nonhuman primates. We assessed 3
repurposed drugs with potent in vitro anti-MERS-CoV activity (mycophenolate
mofetil [MMF], lopinavir/ritonavir, and interferon-β1b) in common marmosets with 
severe disease resembling MERS in humans. The lopinavir/ritonavir-treated and
interferon-β1b-treated animals had better outcome than the untreated animals,
with improved clinical (mean clinical scores ↓50.9%-95.0% and ↓weight loss than
the untreated animals), radiological (minimal pulmonary infiltrates), and
pathological (mild bronchointerstitial pneumonia) findings, and lower mean viral 
loads in necropsied lung (↓0.59-1.06 log10 copies/glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
dehydrogenase [GAPDH]; P < .050) and extrapulmonary (↓0.11-1.29 log10
copies/GAPDH; P < .050 in kidney) tissues. In contrast, all MMF-treated animals
developed severe and/or fatal disease with higher mean viral loads (↑0.15-0.54
log10 copies/GAPDH) than the untreated animals. The mortality rate at 36 hours
postinoculation was 67% (untreated and MMF-treated) versus 0-33%
(lopinavir/ritonavir-treated and interferon-β1b-treated). Lopinavir/ritonavir and
interferon-β1b alone or in combination should be evaluated in clinical trials.
MMF alone may worsen MERS and should not be used.

The emergence of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in
2012 marked the second time that a new, highly pathogenic coronavirus has emerged
in the human population in the 21st century. In this review, we discuss the
current state of knowledge of animal models of MERS-CoV infection. Commonly used 
laboratory animal species such as Syrian hamsters, mice and ferrets are not
susceptible to MERS-CoV, due to differences in the MERS-CoV receptor dipeptidyl
peptidase 4 (DPP4). The initially developed animal models comprise two nonhuman
primate species, the rhesus macaque and the common marmoset. Rhesus macaques
develop a mild to moderate respiratory disease upon inoculation, reminiscent of
milder MERS cases, whereas marmosets develop a moderate to severe respiratory
disease, recapitulating the severe disease observed in some patients. Dromedary
camels, considered to be the reservoir for MERS-CoV, develop a mild upper
respiratory tract infection with abundant viral shedding. Although normal mice
are not susceptible to MERS-CoV, expression of the human DPP4 (hDPP4) overcomes
the lack of susceptibility. Transgenic hDPP4 mice develop severe and lethal
respiratory disease upon inoculation with MERS-CoV. These hDPP4 transgenic mice
are potentially the ideal first line animal model for efficacy testing of
therapeutic and prophylactic countermeasures. Further characterization of
identified countermeasures would ideally be performed in the common marmoset
model, due to the more severe disease outcome. This article forms part of a
symposium in Antiviral Research on "From SARS to MERS: research on highly
pathogenic human coronaviruses."

Adult born neurons in the hippocampus show species-specific differences in their 
numbers, the pace of their maturation and their spatial distribution. Here, we
present quantitative data on adult hippocampal neurogenesis in a New World
primate, the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) that demonstrate parts of the
lineage progression and age-related changes. Proliferation was largely (∼70%)
restricted to stem cells or early progenitor cells, whilst the remainder of the
cycling pool could be assigned almost exclusively to Tbr2+ intermediate precursor
cells in both neonate and adult animals (20-122 months). Proliferating DCX+
neuroblasts were virtually absent in adults, although rare MCM2+/DCX+
co-expression revealed a small, persisting proliferative potential. Co-expression
of DCX with calretinin was very limited in marmosets, suggesting that these
markers label distinct maturational stages. In adult marmosets, numbers of MCM2+,
Ki67+, and significantly Tbr2+, DCX+, and CR+ cells declined with age. The
distributions of granule cells, proliferating cells and DCX+ young neurons along 
the hippocampal longitudinal axis were equal in marmosets and mice. In both
species, a gradient along the hippocampal septo-temporal axis was apparent for
DCX+ and resident granule cells. Both cell numbers are higher septally than
temporally, whilst proliferating cells were evenly distributed along this axis.
Relative to resident granule cells, however, the ratio of proliferating cells and
DCX+ neurons remained constant in the septal, middle, and temporal hippocampus.
In marmosets, the extended phase of the maturation of young neurons that
characterizes primate hippocampal neurogenesis was due to the extension in a
large CR+/DCX- cell population. This clear dissociation between DCX+ and CR+
young neurons has not been reported for other species and may therefore represent
a key primate-specific feature of adult hippocampal neurogenesis.

Trichomonadid protozoa have been found in the intestinal tracts of common
marmosets (Callithrix jacchus). However, there is little information available on
species identification and the pathogenicity of these trichomonads. In this
study, we conducted a fecal survey of a common marmoset colony maintained as
laboratory animals in Japan and identified the trichomonad species. Screening
using a fecal smear examination revealed that 66% (58/88) of the marmosets had
trichomonadid trophozoites in their feces. The trichomonads were found in both
normal feces (31/49, 63%) and diarrhea (27/39, 69%), with no significant
difference in frequency. The protozoa were identified as Pentatrichomonas hominis
using morphological characters and the 100% identity of the nucleotide sequence
of the partial 18S rRNA gene (297 bp). The intraspecific genetic variability
between P. hominis from the marmosets in this study and P. hominis from other
reported mammal hosts was ≤1% in the nucleotide sequence, including the internal 
transcribed spacer (ITS)-1, 5.8S rRNA gene, and ITS-2 (293 bp). P. hominis
inhabits the large intestine of various mammalian hosts, including primates, and 
is considered nonpathogenic. These results suggest that P. hominis is transmitted
among marmosets and other mammals but is not a primary cause of bowel disease in 
marmosets.

The common marmoset is widely used in neuroscience and regenerative medicine
research. However, information concerning common marmoset disorders, particularly
infectious diseases, is scarce. Here, we report a case of a female common
marmoset that died suddenly due to gas gangrene. The animal presented with
gaseous abdominal distention at postmortem, and Clostridium perfringens type A
was isolated from several tissues. Vacuoles, a Gram-positive bacteremia and
intravascular hemolysis were observed microscopically in the muscles, liver and
lungs. On the basis of these findings, we diagnosed nontraumatic gas gangrene
caused by Clostridium perfringens type A in this common marmoset.

The visual brain is composed of interconnected subcortical and cortical
structures that receive and process image information originating in the retina. 
The visual system of nonhuman primates, in particular macaques, has been studied 
in great detail in order to elucidate principles of human sensation and
perception. The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a small New World monkey 
of growing interest as a primate model for neuroscience. Marmosets have
advantages over macaques because of their small size, lissencephalic cortex, and 
growing potential for viral and genetic manipulations. Previous anatomical
studies and electrophysiological recordings in anesthetized marmosets have shown 
that this species' cortical visual hierarchy closely resembles that of other
primates, including humans. Until now, however, there have been no attempts to
systematically study visual responses throughout the marmoset brain using fMRI.
Here we show that awake marmosets readily learn to carry out a simple visual task
inside the bore of an MRI scanner during functional mapping experiments.
Functional scanning at 500 μm in-plane resolution in a 30 cm horizontal bore at 7
T revealed robust positive blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI
responses to visual stimuli throughout visual cortex and associated subcortical
areas. Nonvisual sensory areas showed negative contrasts to visual stimuli
compared to the fixation dot only baseline. Structured images of objects and
faces led to stronger responses than scrambled control images at stages beyond
early visual cortex. Our study establishes fMRI mapping of visual responses in
awake, behaving marmosets as a straightforward and valuable tool for assessing
the functional organization of the primate brain at high resolution.

Although current nonhuman primate models of monkeypox and smallpox diseases
provide some insight into disease pathogenesis, they require a high titer
inoculum, use an unnatural route of infection, and/or do not accurately represent
the entire disease course. This is a concern when developing smallpox and/or
monkeypox countermeasures or trying to understand host pathogen relationships. In
our studies, we altered half of the test system by using a New World nonhuman
primate host, the common marmoset. Based on dose finding studies, we found that
marmosets are susceptible to monkeypox virus infection, produce a high viremia,
and have pathological features consistent with smallpox and monkeypox in humans. 
The low dose (48 plaque forming units) required to elicit a uniformly lethal
disease and the extended incubation (preclinical signs) are unique features among
nonhuman primate models utilizing monkeypox virus. The uniform lethality,
hemorrhagic rash, high viremia, decrease in platelets, pathology, and abbreviated
acute phase are reflective of early-type hemorrhagic smallpox.

Using histological and electrophysiological methods, we identified the
neuroanatomical properties of the common marmoset corticospinal tract (CST),
which underlies hand/arm motor control. Biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) was
injected into the primary motor cortex to anterogradely label CST axons in the
cervical segments, revealing that most CST axons descend in the contralateral
dorsolateral funiculus (DLF; 85.0%), and some in the ipsilateral DLF (10.7%).
Terminal buttons were mainly found in the contralateral lamina VII of the gray
matter, but projection to lamina IX, where forelimb motoneurons are located, was 
rare. Bilateral projections were more abundant than found in the rat CST,
resembling the CST organization of other primates. Intracellular recordings were 
made from 57 forelimb motoneurons on the contralateral side to stimulation, which
revealed no monosynaptic excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs), but di- or
polysynaptic EPSPs and inhibitory synaptic potentials were commonly found. Local 
field potentials showed monosynaptic excitation mainly in laminae VII, where
abundant BDA-labeled CST terminals were observed. These results suggest that
direct corticomotoneuronal projection is absent in common marmosets but di- or
oligosynaptic effects would be mediated by spinal interneurons.

Vocalizations are behaviorally critical sounds, and this behavioral importance is
reflected in the ascending auditory system, where conspecific vocalizations are
increasingly over-represented at higher processing stages. Recent evidence
suggests that, in macaques, this increasing selectivity for vocalizations might
culminate in a cortical region that is densely populated by
vocalization-preferring neurons. Such a region might be a critical node in the
representation of vocal communication sounds, underlying the recognition of
vocalization type, caller and social context. These results raise the questions
of whether cortical specializations for vocalization processing exist in other
species, their cortical location, and their relationship to the auditory
processing hierarchy. To explore cortical specializations for vocalizations in
another species, we performed high-field fMRI of the auditory cortex of a vocal
New World primate, the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). Using a sparse
imaging paradigm, we discovered a caudal-rostral gradient for the processing of
conspecific vocalizations in marmoset auditory cortex, with regions of the
anterior temporal lobe close to the temporal pole exhibiting the highest
preference for vocalizations. These results demonstrate similar cortical
specializations for vocalization processing in macaques and marmosets, suggesting
that cortical specializations for vocal processing might have evolved before the 
lineages of these species diverged.

Folate receptors α (FRα) and β (FRβ) are two isoforms of the cell surface
glycoprotein that binds folate. The expression of FRα is rare in normal cells and
elevated in cancer cells. Thus, FRα-based tumor-targeted therapy has been a focus
area of laboratory research and clinical trials. Recently, it was shown that a
significant fraction of tumor-associated macrophages expresses FRβ and that these
cells can enhance tumor growth. Although FRα and FRβ share 70% identity in their 
deduced amino acid sequence, a monoclonal antibody (MAb) reactive with both
receptors has not been developed. A MAb that can target both FRα-expressing
cancer cells and FRβ-expressing tumor-associated macrophages may provide a more
potent therapeutic tool for cancer than individual anti-FRα or anti-FRβ MAbs. In 
this study, we developed a MAb that recognizes both FRα and FRβ (anti-FRαβ). The 
anti-FRαβ specifically stained trophoblasts and macrophages from human placenta, 
synovial macrophages from rheumatoid arthritis patient, liver macrophages from
cynomolgus monkey and common marmoset, and cancer cells and tumor-associated
macrophages from ovary and lung carcinomas. Surface plasmon resonance showed that
the anti-FRαβ bound to soluble forms of the FRα and FRβ proteins with high
affinity (KD=6.26×10(-9) M and 4.33×10(-9) M, respectively). In vitro functional 
analysis of the anti-FRαβ showed that this MAb mediates complement-dependent
cytotoxicity, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, and antibody-dependent
cellular phagocytosis of FRα-expressing and FRβ-expressing cell lines. The
anti-FRαβ MAb is a promising therapeutic candidate for cancers in which
macrophages promote tumor progression.

Cadherin is a cell adhesion molecule widely expressed in the nervous system.
Previously, we analyzed the expression of nine classic cadherins (Cdh4, Cdh6,
Cdh7, Cdh8, Cdh9, Cdh10, Cdh11, Cdh12, and Cdh20) and T-cadherin (Cdh13) in the
developing postnatal common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) brain, and found
differential expressions between mice and marmosets. In this study, to explore
primate-specific cadherin expression at the embryonic stage, we extensively
analyzed the expression of these cadherins in the developing embryonic marmoset
brain. Each cadherin showed differential spatial and temporal expression and
exhibited temporally complicated expression. Furthermore, the expression of some 
cadherins differed from that in rodent brains, even at the embryonic stage. These
results suggest the possibility that the differential expressions of diverse
cadherins are involved in primate specific cortical development, from the
prenatal to postnatal period.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a New World primate that is used in
biomedical research due to its small size and relative ease of handling compared 
with larger primates. Although bone disease in common marmosets is well
recognized, there are very few detailed descriptions in the literature that cover
the range of lesions seen in these animals. For all animals used to model human
disease, it is important to be aware of background lesions that may affect the
interpretation of study findings. This retrospective study details bone diseases 
encountered in marmoset breeding colonies at 2 different institutions. Affected
marmosets at Johns Hopkins University had lesions compatible with diagnoses of
rickets, fibrous osteodystrophy and osteopenia. Affected marmosets at the
Wisconsin National Primate Research Center exhibited severe lesions of
osteoclastic bone resorption and remodeling that had an unusual distribution and 
were not easily categorized into a known disease entity. The purpose of this
report is to document these naturally occurring skeletal lesions of common
marmosets and suggest an approach to evaluating skeletal disease in prospective
studies of these animals that will allow the most accurate diagnoses.

Hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) derived from embryonic stem cells
(ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have potential therapeutic
applications in humans. To assess the safety and efficacy of ESC/iPSC-based
therapies, reliable animal models are required prior to their clinical
application. The common marmoset (CM) was recently found to be a useful nonhuman 
primate animal model for drug development and safety assessment. However, a
method for the efficient hematopoietic differentiation of CM ESCs has not been
established. In this study, we developed a novel and efficient method for
differentiating CM ESCs into hematopoietic cells by transiently inhibiting the
phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-Protein kinase B (AKT) pathway, a critical
pathway that maintains the undifferentiated state of CM ESCs during embryoid body
(EB) formation. Compared with controls, transient inhibition of the P13K-AKT
pathway resulted in a threefold increase in the proportion of enriched CD34⁺
cells (p < 0.001) and an increase in the number of hematopoietic colonies on day 
8 of CM EB cultures. Moreover, number of blast colonies, number of hematopoietic 
progenitor cell populations of CD34⁺CD117⁺, CD34⁺CD45⁺, and CD43⁺CD45⁺ cells, and
expression of hematopoietic genes were increased by transient inhibition of the
PI3K-AKT pathway. We also demonstrated that the hematopoietic progenitor cell
population was increased by inhibition of PI3K in a human system. Our novel and
efficient ESC differentiation method might be useful for preclinical research on 
human hematopoietic disorders and may be efficiently translated to human
ESC/iPSC-based regenerative medicine.

Meissner's corpuscles (MCs) are tactile mechanoreceptors found in the glabrous
skin of primates, including fingertips. These receptors are characterized by
sensitivity to light touch, and therefore might be associated with the evolution 
of manipulative abilities of the hands in primates. We examined MCs in different 
primate species, including common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus, n = 5), baboon
(Papio anubis, n = 2), rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta, n = 3), chimpanzee (Pan
troglodytes, n = 3), bonobo (Pan paniscus, n = 1) and human (Homo sapiens,
n = 8). Fingertips of the first, second and fourth digits were collected from
both hands of specimens, dissected and histologically stained using hematoxylin
and eosin. The density (MCs per 1 mm(2) ) and the size (cross-sectional diameter 
of MCs) were quantified. Overall, there were no differences in the densities of
MCs or their size among the digits or between the hands for any species examined.
However, MCs varied across species. We found a trend for higher densities of MCs 
in macaques and humans compared with chimpanzees and bonobos; moreover, apes had 
larger MCs than monkeys. We further examined whether the density or size of MCs
varied as a function of body mass, measures of dexterity and dietary frugivory.
Among these variables, only body size accounted for a significant amount of
variation in the size of MCs.

: Previous studies have demonstrated that neural stem/progenitor cells (NS/PCs)
promote functional recovery in rodent animal models of spinal cord injury (SCI). 
Because distinct differences exist in the neuroanatomy and immunological
responses between rodents and primates, it is critical to determine the
effectiveness and safety of allografted embryonic stem cell (ESC)-derived NS/PCs 
(ESC-NS/PCs) in a nonhuman primate SCI model. In the present study, common
marmoset ESC-NS/PCs were grafted into the lesion epicenter 14 days after
contusive SCI in adult marmosets (transplantation group). In the control group,
phosphate-buffered saline was injected instead of cells. In the presence of a
low-dose of tacrolimus, several grafted cells survived without tumorigenicity and
differentiated into neurons, astrocytes, or oligodendrocytes. Significant
differences were found in the transverse areas of luxol fast blue-positive myelin
sheaths, neurofilament-positive axons, corticospinal tract fibers, and platelet
endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1-positive vessels at the lesion epicenter
between the transplantation and control groups. Immunoelectron microscopic
examination demonstrated that the grafted ESC-NS/PC-derived oligodendrocytes
contributed to the remyelination of demyelinated axons. In addition, some grafted
neurons formed synaptic connections with host cells, and some transplanted
neurons were myelinated by host cells. Eventually, motor functional recovery
significantly improved in the transplantation group compared with the control
group. In addition, a mixed lymphocyte reaction assay indicated that ESC-NS/PCs
modulated the allogeneic immune rejection. Taken together, our results indicate
that allogeneic transplantation of ESC-NS/PCs from a nonhuman primate promoted
functional recovery after SCI without tumorigenicity.SIGNIFICANCE: This study
demonstrates that allogeneic embryonic stem cell (ESC)-derived neural
stem/progenitor cells (NS/PCs) promoted functional recovery after transplantation
into the injured spinal cord in nonhuman primates. ESC-NS/PCs were chosen because
ESC-NS/PCs are one of the controls for induced pluripotent stem cell-derived
NS/PCs and because ESC derivatives are possible candidates for clinical use. This
translational research using an allograft model of a nonhuman primate is critical
for clinical application of grafting NS/PCs derived from various allogeneic
pluripotent stem cells, especially induced pluripotent stem cells, into injured
spinal cord at the subacute phase.

Movement dysfunction in Parkinson's disease (PD) is caused by the degeneration of
dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra (SN). Here, we established a
method for voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and automatic tissue segmentation of the
marmoset monkey brain using a 7-T animal scanner and applied the method to assess
DA degeneration in a PD model, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine
(MPTP)-treated animals, with tyrosine-hydroxylase staining. The most significant 
decreases of local tissue volume were detected in the bilateral SN of
MPTP-treated marmoset brains (-53.0% in right and -46.5% in left) and
corresponded with the location of DA neurodegeneration found in histology (-65.4%
in right). In addition to the SN, the decreases were also confirmed in the locus 
coeruleus, and lateral hypothalamus. VBM using 7-T MRI was effective in detecting
volume loss in the SN of the PD-model marmoset. This study provides a potential
basis for the application of VBM with ultra-high field MRI in the clinical
diagnosis of PD. The developed method may also offer value in automatic
whole-brain evaluation of structural changes for the marmoset monkey.

Multipotent stromal cells derived from the common marmoset monkey Callithrix
jacchus (cjMSCs) possess high phylogenetic similarity to humans, with a great
potential for preclinical studies in the field of regenerative medicine. Safe and
effective long-term storage of cells is of great significance to clinical and
research applications. Encapsulation of such cell types within alginate beads
that can mimic an extra-cellular matrix and provide a supportive environment for 
cells during cryopreservation, has several advantages over freezing of cells in
suspension. In this study we have analysed the effect of dimethyl sulfoxide
(Me2SO, 2.5-10%, v/v) and pre-freeze loading time of alginate encapsulated cjMSCs
in Me2SO (0-45 min) on the viability and metabolic activity of the cells after
freezing using a slow cooling rate (-1°C/min). It was found that these parameters
affect the stability and homogeneity of alginate beads after thawing. Moreover,
the cjMSCs can be frozen in alginate beads with lower Me2SO concentration of 7.5%
after 30 min of loading, while retaining high cryopreservation outcome. We
demonstrated the maximum viability, membrane integrity and metabolic activity of 
the cells under optimized, less cytotoxic conditions. The results of this study
are another step forward towards the application of cryopreservation for the
long-term storage and subsequent applications of transplants in cell-based
therapies.

Analysis of the hematopoiesis of non-human primates is important to clarify the
evolution of primate-specific hematopoiesis and immune regulation. However, the
engraftment and development of the primate hematopoietic system are
well-documented only in humans and are not clear in non-human primates.
Callithrix jacchus (common marmoset, CM) is a New World monkey with a high rate
of pregnancy and small size that lives in closed colonies. As stem cell factor
(SCF) is an essential molecule for hematopoietic stem cell development in mice
and humans, we focused on CD117, the SCF receptor, and examined whether
CD117-expressing cells possess the hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell
characteristics of newborn marmoset-derived hematopoietic cells that can develop 
into T cells and B cells. When CD117(+) cell fractions of the bone marrow were
transplanted into immunodeficient NOD (non-obese diabetic)/Shi-scid, common
γc-null (NOG) mice, these cells engrafted efficiently in the bone marrow and
spleens of the NOG mice. The CD117(+) cells developed into myeloid lineage cells,
CD20(+) B cells and CD3(+) T cells, which could express CM cytokines in vivo. The
development of B cells did not precede that of T cells. The development of CD8(+)
T cells was dominant in NOG mice. The engraftment was comparable for both
CD117(+)CD34(+) cells and CD117(+)CD34(-) cells. These results suggest that the
CD117(+) cell fraction can differentiate into all three cell lineages, and the
development of marmoset immunity in the xenogeneic environment follows diverse
developmental pathways compared with human immunity.

Centromeres usually contain large amounts of tandem repeat DNA. Alpha satellite
DNA (AS) is the most abundant tandem repeat DNA found in the centromeres of
simian primates. The AS of humans contains sequences organized into higher-order 
repeat (HOR) structures, which are tandem arrays of larger repeat units
consisting of multiple basic repeat units. HOR-carrying AS also occurs in other
hominoids, but results reported to date for phylogenetically more remote taxa
have been negative. Here we show direct evidence for clear HOR structures in AS
of the owl monkey and common marmoset. These monkeys are New World monkey species
that are located phylogenetically outside of hominoids. It is currently
postulated that the presence of HOR structures in AS is unique to hominoids. Our 
results suggest that this view must be modified. A plausible explanation is that 
generation of HOR structures is a general event that occurs occasionally or
frequently in primate centromeres, and that, in humans, HOR-carrying AS became
predominant in the central region of the centromere. It is often difficult to
assemble sequence reads of tandem repeat DNAs into accurate contig sequences; our
careful sequencing strategy allowed us to overcome this problem.

Shortening the lengthy treatment duration for tuberculosis patients is a major
goal of current drug development efforts. The common marmoset develops human-like
disease pathology and offers an attractive model to better understand the basis
for relapse and test regimens for effective shorter duration therapy. We treated 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis-infected marmosets with two drug regimens known to
differ in their relapse rates in human clinical trials: the standard four-drug
combination of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol (HRZE) that has 
very low relapse rates and the combination of isoniazid and streptomycin that is 
associated with higher relapse rates. As early as 2 weeks, the more sterilizing
regimen significantly reduced the volume of lung disease by computed tomography
(P = 0.035) and also significantly reduced uptake of
[(18)F]-2-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose by positron emission tomography (P = 0.049).
After 6 weeks of therapy, both treatments caused similar reductions in granuloma 
bacterial load, but the more sterilizing, four-drug regimen caused greater
reduction in bacterial load in cavitary lesions (P = 0.009). These findings,
combined with the association in humans between cavitary disease and relapse,
suggest that the basis for improved sterilizing activity of the four-drug
combination is both its faster disease volume resolution and its stronger
sterilizing effect on cavitary lesions. Definitive data from relapse experiments 
are needed to support this observation.

We report a preclinical study of a pyrrole-imidazole (PI) polyamide that targets 
the human transforming growth factor (hTGF)-β1 gene as a novel transcriptional
gene silencer in a common marmoset primate model. We designed and then
synthesized PI polyamides to target the hTGF-β1 promoter. We examined effects of 
seven PI polyamides (GB1101-1107) on the expression of hTGF-β1 mRNA stimulated
with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) in human vascular smooth muscle cells.
GB1101, GB1105 and GB1106 significantly inhibited hTGF-β1 mRNA expression. We
examined GB1101 as a PI polyamide to hTGF-β1 for hypertrophic scars in marmosets 
in vivo. Injection of GB1101 completely inhibited hypertrophic scar formation at 
35 days post-incision and inhibited cellular infiltration, TGF-β1 and vimentin
staining, and epidermal thickness. Mismatch polyamide did not affect hypertrophic
scarring or histological changes. Epidermis was significantly thinner with GB1101
than with water and mismatch PI polyamides. We developed the PI polyamides for
practical ointment medicines for the treatment of hypertrophic scars.
FITC-labeled GB1101 with solbase most efficiently distributed in the nuclei of
epidermal keratinocytes, completely suppressed hypertropic scarring at 42 days
after incision, and considerably inhibited epidermal thickness and
vimentin-positive fibroblasts. PI polyamides targeting hTGF-β1 promoter with
solbase ointment will be practical medicines for treating hypertrophic scars
after surgical operations and skin burns.

Research aimed at developing new therapies for Parkinson's disease (PD)
critically depend on valid animal models of the disease that allows for repeated 
testing of motor disabilities over extended time periods. We here present an
extensive characterization of a wide range of motor symptoms in the 6-OHDA
marmoset model of PD when tested over several months. The severity of motor
deficits was quantified in two ways: (i) through manual scoring protocols
appropriately adapted to include species specific motor behavior and (ii) using
automated quantitative motion tracking based on image processing of the digital
video recordings. We show that the automated methods allow for rapid and reliable
characterization of motor dysfunctions, thus complementing the manual scoring
procedures, and that robust motor symptoms lasting for several months could be
induced when using a two-stage neurotoxic lesioning procedure involving one
hemisphere at a time. This non-human primate model of PD should therefore be well
suited for long-term evaluation of novel therapies for treatment of PD.

Smooth pursuit eye movements stabilize slow-moving objects on the retina by
matching eye velocity with target velocity. Two critical components are required 
to generate smooth pursuit: first, because it is a voluntary eye movement, the
subject must select a target to pursue to engage the tracking system; and second,
generating smooth pursuit requires a moving stimulus. We examined whether this
behavior also exists in the common marmoset, a New World primate that is
increasingly attracting attention as a genetic model for mental disease and
systems neuroscience. We measured smooth pursuit in two marmosets, previously
trained to perform fixation tasks, using the standard Rashbass step-ramp pursuit 
paradigm. We first measured the aspects of visual motion that drive pursuit eye
movements. Smooth eye movements were in the same direction as target motion,
indicating that pursuit was driven by target movement rather than by
displacement. Both the open-loop acceleration and closed-loop eye velocity
exhibited a linear relationship with target velocity for slow-moving targets, but
this relationship declined for higher speeds. We next examined whether marmoset
pursuit eye movements depend on an active engagement of the pursuit system by
measuring smooth eye movements evoked by small perturbations of motion from
fixation or during pursuit. Pursuit eye movements were much larger during pursuit
than from fixation, indicating that pursuit is actively gated. Several practical 
advantages of the marmoset brain, including the accessibility of the middle
temporal (MT) area and frontal eye fields at the cortical surface, merit its
utilization for studying pursuit movements.

Burkholderia mallei is a host-adapted bacterium that does not persist outside of 
its equine reservoir. The organism causes the zoonosis glanders, which is endemic
in Asia, Africa, the Middle East and South America. Infection by B. mallei
typically occurs via the respiratory or percutaneous route, and the most common
manifestations are life-threatening pneumonia and bacteremia. Glanders is
difficult to diagnose and requires prolonged antibiotic therapy with low success 
rates. There is no vaccine to protect against B. mallei and there is concern
regarding its use as a biothreat agent. Thus, experiments were performed to
establish a non-human primate model of intranasal infection to study the organism
and develop countermeasures. Groups of marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) were
inoculated intranasally with B. mallei strain ATCC 23344 and monitored for
clinical signs of illness for up to 13 days. We discovered that 83% of marmosets 
inoculated with doses of 2.5 X 10(4) to 2.5 X 10(5) bacteria developed acute
lethal infection within 3-4 days. Signs of disease were severe and included
lethargy, inappetence, conjunctivitis, mucopurulent and hemorrhagic nasal
discharges, and increased respiratory effort with abdominal lifts. Burkholderia
mallei was cultured from the lungs, spleen and liver of these animals, and
pathologic examination of tissues revealed lesions characteristic of glanders.
Challenge experiments also revealed that 91% of animals infected with doses
ranging from 25 to 2.5 X 10(3) bacteria exhibited mild non-specific signs of
illness and were culture negative. One marmoset inoculated with 2.5 X 10(3)
organisms developed moderate signs of disease and reached humane end-points 8
days post-infection. The liver and spleen of this animal were colonized with the 
agent and pathological analysis of tissues showed nasal, splenic and hepatic
lesions. Taken together, these data indicate that the marmoset is a suitable
model to study respiratory infection by B. mallei.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a New World primate species, is
potentially a useful animal model for preclinical studies in drug development.
However, cytochrome P450 (P450) enzymes have not been fully identified and
characterized in marmosets. In this study, we identified P450 2A6 cDNA with the
sequence highly identical (91-94%) to human P450 2A6, 2A7, and 2A13 cDNA and
cynomolgus monkey P450 2A23, 2A24, and 2A26 cDNA. Among the tissue types
examined, marmoset P450 2A6 mRNA was most abundantly expressed in livers where
P450 2A6 protein was also detected by immunoblotting. Phylogenetic analysis
showed that marmoset P450 2A6 was more closely clustered with human and
cynomolgus monkey P450 2As than P450 2As of dog, rat, and mouse (the species also
used in drug metabolism). Marmoset P450 2A6 heterologously expressed in
Escherichia coli membranes efficiently catalyzed 7-ethoxycoumarin O-deethylation,
similar to human P450 2A6 and 2A13 and cynomolgus monkey P450 2A23, 2A24, and
2A26, but much less effectively coumarin 7-hydroxylation, showing some difference
as well. Interestingly, marmoset P450 2A6 and cynomolgus monkey P450 2A23
catalyzed phenacetin O-deethylation, which is catalyzed by human P450 1A2 and
2A13, but not by P450 2A6. Marmoset P450 2A6 also exhibited catalytic activity
toward testosterone by the multiple sites, but not rat P450 2A-specific
testosterone 7α-hydroxylation activity. These results indicated that marmoset
P450 2A6 had functional characteristics different from those of human and
cynomolgus monkey P450 2As in terms of partially different substrate
specificities and catalytic activities, indicating its importance of further
studies for P450 2A-dependent drug metabolism in marmosets.

Vitamin D metabolites are widely studied for their roles in bone health, immune
functions, and other potential physiologic roles in humans. However, the optimal 
blood levels of vitamin D metabolites are still unclear. Various methods for
measuring vitamin D metabolites have been used and recently liquid chromatography
tandem mass spectroscopy (LC-MS/MS) has been adopted as the gold standard for
vitamin D metabolite measurement. Here, we report the use of LC-MS/MS to measure 
25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D(2&3)), and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D
(1,25(OH)2D(2&3)), in three laboratory nonhuman primate species: common marmoset 
(Callithrix jacchus), rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta), and cynomolgus macaque
(Macaca fascicularis), and compare them to humans using the same technique. The
nonhuman primates showed blood levels for 25(OH)D3 and 1,25(OH)2D3 significantly 
higher than human values with marmosets having the highest levels. Marmoset
samples showed significantly more variability among individuals than those from
macaques for both metabolites, but all three nonhuman primate species exhibited
large variation within species for both 25(OH)D(2&3) and 1,25(OH)2D(2&3).
Marmoset females had significantly lower values than the males for 25(OH)D3,
while rhesus males showed a significant decrease in 25(OH)D3 with age. The most
striking finding is the variation within species for vitamin D levels even in
laboratory primates that have a controlled diet, UV exposure, and in some cases, 
genetic constraints. Similar variation in 25(OH)D responses to a fixed dose of
oral vitamin D supplementation has been reported in humans. We suggest that these
species can provide primate models for examining the factors influencing
variation in the levels of vitamin D necessary for human and nonhuman primate
health.

In captivity, Callithrix jacchus (common marmoset) is on average heavier than
their wild-living counterparts, and has a tendency to produce triplet litters
rather than the normal twins. To provide initial basic information about possible
weight-related differences among the ovaries, a morphometric study of follicular 
phase ovaries from 48 young adult marmosets has been carried out. Nearly 90% of
these ovaries were found to contain some degree of luteal tissue composed of
large and/or small cells. The luteal structures, follicles of all stages, and
stroma were subjected to morphometric analysis, and these results were compared
with body weight, circulating triglyceride, androstenedione, and total estrogens.
Where only large luteal cells were present, the median body weight was the
highest (only this group included animals over 500 g) compared with mixed, or
only small luteal cells, or absence of luteal cells. Furthermore, in this group
plasma triglycerides were significantly higher compared to other groups,
suggesting possible role of triglycerides in promoting luteinisation. Plasma
androstenedione was also a critical discriminating factor, and was elevated where
large luteal cells were present even as a mixture with small cells suggesting the
large luteal cells to be the likely major ovarian source of this hormone and its 
metabolites. Additionally, the ovaries with large luteal cells compared to those 
containing only small or no luteal cells, had lower primordial follicle reserve
associated with high levels of atresia and luteinisation among growing
non-ovulatory follicles, indicating an accelerated activation, but at the same
time a suboptimal environment for follicular growth.

BACKGROUND: The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a small, New World
primate that is used extensively in biomedical and behavioral research. This
short-lived primate, with its small body size, ease of handling, and docile
temperament, has emerged as a valuable model for aging and neurodegenerative
research. A growing body of research has indicated exercise, aerobic exercise
especially, imparts beneficial effects to normal aging. Understanding the
mechanisms underlying these positive effects of exercise, and the degree to which
exercise has neurotherapeutic effects, is an important research focus. Thus,
developing techniques to engage marmosets in aerobic exercise would have great
advantages.
NEW METHOD: Here we describe the marmoset exercise ball (MEB) paradigm: a safe
(for both experimenter and subjects), novel and effective means to engage
marmosets in aerobic exercise. We trained young adult male marmosets to run on
treadmills for 30 min a day, 3 days a week.
RESULTS: Our training procedures allowed us to engage male marmosets in this
aerobic exercise within 4 weeks, and subjects maintained this frequency of
exercise for 3 months.
COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: To our knowledge, this is the first described
method to engage marmosets in aerobic exercise. A major advantage of this
exercise paradigm is that while it was technically forced exercise, it did not
appear to induce stress in the marmosets.
CONCLUSIONS: These techniques should be useful to researchers wishing to address 
physiological responses of exercise in a marmoset model.

There is an emerging interest in brain-mapping projects in countries across the
world, including the USA, Europe, Australia and China. In 2014, Japan started a
brain-mapping project called Brain Mapping by Integrated Neurotechnologies for
Disease Studies (Brain/MINDS). Brain/MINDS aims to map the structure and function
of neuronal circuits to ultimately understand the vast complexity of the human
brain, and takes advantage of a unique non-human primate animal model, the common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). In Brain/MINDS, the RIKEN Brain Science Institute 
acts as a central institute. The objectives of Brain/MINDS can be categorized
into the following three major subject areas: (i) structure and functional
mapping of a non-human primate brain (the marmoset brain); (ii) development of
innovative neurotechnologies for brain mapping; and (iii) human brain mapping;
and clinical research. Brain/MINDS researchers are highly motivated to identify
the neuronal circuits responsible for the phenotype of neurological and
psychiatric disorders, and to understand the development of these devastating
disorders through the integration of these three subject areas.

Since the availability of the common marmoset monkey as a primate model in
neuroscience research has recently increased, much effort has been made to
develop a reliable guide of the brain structures of this species. In this
article, we review the development of the marmoset brain atlas and discuss a
newly developed brain model, which was reconstructed from histological sections
under volume-rendering technology. This kind of brain model allows virtual
sections to be constructed on any axis, with nomenclatural annotations to
structures in situ. This model is also applicable for the identification of
structures revealed in magnetic resonance imaging studies. The brain model is
accessible at the following web address:

Cognitive bias, hand preference and welfare of common marmosets.

Common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) have hand preferences for grasping pieces
of food and holding them while eating and these are stable throughout adult life.
We report here that left-handed marmosets have negative cognitive bias compared
to right-handed marmosets. Twelve marmosets were trained to expect a food reward 
from a bowl with a black lid and not from one with a white lid, or vice versa. In
probe tests with ambiguous, grey-lidded bowls a left-handed group (N=7) were less
likely to remove the lid to inspect the bowl than a right-handed group (N=5).
This difference between left- and right-handed marmosets was not dependent on
rate of learning, sex or age. In fact, hand-preference was not associated with
rate of learning the task. Furthermore, retrospective examination of colony
records of 39 marmosets revealed that more aggression was directed towards left- 
than right-handed marmosets. Hence, hand preference, which can be measured
easily, could serve as an indicator of cognitive bias and may signal a need for
particular care in laboratory environments. We explain the results by arguing
that hand preference reflects more frequent (or dominant) use of the opposite
hemisphere and this predisposes individuals to behave differently.

The chemokine receptor CXCR7 interacts with the chemokines CXCL11 and CXCL12.
During development, this ligand receptor system (C-X-C) provokes
cell-type-specific responses in terms of migration, adhesion or ligand
sequestration. It is active in zebrafish and rodents but no data are available
for its presence or function in primate testes. Real-time quantitative polymerase
chain reaction was performed in monkeys to detect CXCL11, CXCL12 and CXCR7. At
the protein level, CXCL12 and CXCR7 were localized in the testes of the marmoset 
(Callitrix jacchus) whereas CXCR7 patterns were determined for various stages in 
human testes. Morphometry and flow cytometry were applied to quantify
CXCR7-positive cells in monkeys. Transcript levels and protein expression of
CXCR7 were detectable throughout testicular development. In both species, CXCR7
protein expression was restricted to premeiotic germ cells. In immature marmoset 
testes, 69.9% ± 9% of the total germ cell population were labelled for CXCR7,
whereas in the adult, 4.7% ± 2.7% were positive for CXCR7. CXCL12 mRNA was
detectable in all developmental stages in marmosets. The CXCL12 protein was
exclusively localized to Sertoli cells. This pattern of CXCL12/CXCR7 indicates
their involvement in regulatory processes that possibly orchestrate the
interaction between undifferentiated germ cells and Sertoli cells.

The cerebellum is known as the major target regions of methylmercury (MeHg)
toxicity, but the mechanisms are still not fully understood. We studied the
effects of MeHg exposure in the cerebellum of common marmoset (Callithrix
jacchus) using a shotgun proteomic approach with liquid chromatography coupled to
mass spectrometry. A total of 1000 common proteins were identified in all
samples, and 102 proteins were significantly differentially expressed in the
cerebellum of common marmoset with orally dosed MeHg (1.5 mg MeHg/kg body weight 
for 2 weeks) compared with those of the control group. Functional enrichment
analysis and pathway predictions showed that the differentially expressed
proteins were involved in carbohydrate derivative metabolic process, ion
transport including synaptic transmission, cell development, and calcium
signaling pathway. Cellular component enrichment analysis showed that they were
mainly distributed in plasma membrane, excitatory synapse, and synaptic membrane.
These results indicate that synaptic transmission and calcium signaling pathways 
are the core functions affected by MeHg. We found a total of 21 novel proteins
affected by MeHg in synaptic transmission and calcium signaling pathways. DLG4:
(PSD95) and MIR-19A/MIR-19B were found to be potential key targets leading to the
multiple effects of MeHg neurotoxicity. These results show the global effects of 
MeHg on cellular functions and pathways leading to neurological deficits in
common marmoset.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a New World primate that is a useful 
model for medical studies. In this study, we report a convenient, reliable, and
noninvasive procedure to genotype a living common marmoset by using fingernails. 
This method was used to successfully genotype DNA by restriction fragment length 
polymorphism (RFLP) PCR without prior purification, by using the KOD FX PCR
enzyme kit. Additionally, there is no sample contamination from hematopoietic
chimera derived from fused placenta in utero. We compared chimeric levels between
various tissues in females with male littermates using quantitative fluorescent
(QF)-PCR to prepare a reliable DNA source for genetic analyses, such as
genotyping, gene mapping, or genomic sequencing. The chimerism detected appeared 
to be restricted to lymphatic tissues, such as bone marrow, thymus, spleen, lymph
nodes and blood cells. As a result, DNA from fingernails with the quick is the
best DNA source for genetic research in living marmosets.

Callithrix jacchus (common marmoset) is a New World primate monkey, used as an
animal model in biomedical research. Marmoset-specific follicle-stimulating
hormone (FSH) preparation is required to improve superovulation protocols and to 
develop homologous FSH monitoring assays in these monkeys. In this study, we
document the large-scale expression of recombinant marmoset FSH in methylotropic 
yeast, Pichia pastoris. The recombinant preparation was found to be
immunologically active in Western blotting and radioimmunoassay. The preparation 
displayed receptor binding ability in radioreceptor assay. Based on the receptor 
binding ability, the yield of fermentation was estimated to be 7.2 mg/L.
FSH-induced cAMP assay and estradiol assay revealed that the recombinant hormone 
is able to induce signal transduction. Both immunological and in vitro biological
activity of marmoset FSH was found to be comparable to purified human pituitary
FSH, which served as reference hormone for these assays. Thus, the study suggests
that a Pichia expression system can be used for large-scale expression of
bioactive recombinant marmoset FSH.

Previous pilot clinical studies have shown that the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor
agonist tandospirone has beneficial effect on cognitive deficits associated with 
schizophrenia. In the present study, we evaluated the cognitive efficacy of
tandospirone, given alone or in combination with the antipsychotic blonanserin,
risperidone or haloperidol, on executive function in marmosets using the object
retrieval with detour (ORD) task. Treatment with tandospirone alone at 20 and 40 
mg/kg increased the number of correct responses in the difficult trial, while
risperidone (0.3mg/kg) and haloperidol (0.3mg/kg) decreased the number of correct
responses in this trial. On the other hand, blonanserin (0.1-0.3mg/kg), an
atypical antipsychotic highly selective for dopamine D2/D3 and serotonin 5-HT2A
receptors, did not affect the number of correct responses in both the easy and
difficult trials. Co-treatment with tandospirone (20mg/kg) and risperidone
(0.1-0.3mg/kg) or haloperidol (0.1-0.3mg/kg) did not improve animals' performance
in the difficult trial. However, co-treatment with tandospirone and blonanserin
(0.1-0.3mg/kg) increased the number of correct responses in the difficult trial. 
In addition, treatment with the dopamine D1 receptor agonist SKF-81297 at 1mg/kg 
increased marmosets correct responses in the difficult trial. These results
suggest that tandospirone is a promising candidate for the treatment of cognitive
deficits associated with schizophrenia and that adjunctive treatment with
tandospirone and blonanserin is more appropriate for cognitive deficits than
combination therapy with tandospirone and risperidone or haloperidol. The results
of this study also indicate that the putative mechanism of action of tandospirone
might be related to enhancement of dopamine neurotransmission via activation of
the 5-HT1A receptor.

1. Although the New World non-human primate, the common marmoset (Callithrix
jacchus), is a potentially useful animal model, comprehensive understanding of
drug metabolizing enzymes is insufficient. 2. A cDNA encoding a novel cytochrome 
P450 (P450) 2D8 was identified in marmosets. The amino acid sequence deduced from
P450 2D8 cDNA showed a high sequence identity (83-86%) with other primate P450
2Ds. Phylogenetic analysis showed that marmoset P450 2D8 was closely clustered
with human P450 2D6, unlike P450 2Ds of miniature pig, dog, rabbit, guinea pig,
mouse or rat. 3. Marmoset P450 2D8 mRNA was predominantly expressed in the liver 
and small intestine among the tissues types analyzed, whereas marmoset P450 2D6
mRNA was expressed predominantly in the liver where P450 2D protein was detected 
by immunoblotting. 4. By metabolic assays using marmoset P450 2D8 protein
heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli, although P450 2D8 exhibits lower
catalytic efficiency compared to marmoset and human P450 2D6 enzymes, P450 2D8
mediated O-demethylations of metoprolol and dextromethorphan and bufuralol
1'-hydroxylation. 5. These results suggest that marmoset P450 2D8 (also expressed
in the extrahepatic tissues) has potential roles in drug metabolism in a similar 
manner to those of human and marmoset P450 2D6.

Groundbreaking studies showed that differentiated somatic cells of mouse and
human origin could be reverted to a stable pluripotent state by the ectopic
expression of only four proteins. The resulting pluripotent cells, called induced
pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, could be an alternative to embryonic stem cells,
which are under continuous ethical debate. Hence, iPS cell-derived functional
cells such as neurons may become the key for an effective treatment of currently 
incurable degenerative diseases. However, besides the requirement of efficacy
testing of the therapy also its long-term safety needs to be carefully evaluated 
in settings mirroring the clinical situation in an optimal way. In this context, 
we chose the long-lived common marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus) as a
non-human primate species to generate iPS cells. The marmoset monkey is
frequently used in biomedical research and is gaining more and more preclinical
relevance due to the increasing number of disease models. Here, we describe, to
our knowledge, the first-time generation of marmoset monkey iPS cells from
postnatal skin fibroblasts by non-viral means. We used the transposon-based,
fully reversible piggyback system. We cloned the marmoset monkey reprogramming
factors and established robust and reproducible reprogramming protocols with a
six-factor-in-one-construct approach. We generated six individual iPS cell lines 
and characterized them in comparison with marmoset monkey embryonic stem cells.
The generated iPS cells are morphologically indistinguishable from marmoset ES
cells. The iPS cells are fully reprogrammed as demonstrated by differentiation
assays, pluripotency marker expression and transcriptome analysis. They are
stable for numerous passages (more than 80) and exhibit euploidy. In summary, we 
have established efficient non-viral reprogramming protocols for the derivation
of stable marmoset monkey iPS cells, which can be used to develop and test cell
replacement therapies in preclinical settings.

This study aimed to establish an experimental exudative age-related macular
degeneration (AMD) model in the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), which is a 
small New World monkey. Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) was induced by laser
irradiation on the left eye of each animal under anesthesia. Eight laser spots
were applied around the macular area using the image-guided laser system (532 nm)
attached with Micron III at 650 mW-2,000 mW power. Laser pulse duration and spot 
size were fixed at 100 ms and 50 µm, respectively. At 14 days after laser
irradiation, fluorescein angiograms were observed. At 21 days after laser
irradiation, the fluorescein angiograms were transcardially perfused to the
bilateral common carotid arteries with 4% paraformaldehyde for the transverse
section or with fluorescein-conjugated dextran (MW = 2,000 kDa) for the retinal
pigment epithelia (RPE)-choroidal flatmount. At 14 days after laser irradiation, 
late hyperfluorescence and leakage within or beyond the lesion borders were
observed in a laser power-dependent manner. In the RPE-choroidal flatmount, the
mean size of the CNV lesions at 1,500 mW was 1.34 ± 0.49 × 10(5) µm(2) (Mean ±
S.D., n = 29), and the coefficient of variation for each CNV area was 36.5% (n = 
29). In conclusion, we succeeded in producing an experimental exudative type of
AMD model in the common marmoset. This model may be useful in elucidating the
pathophysiological mechanism and screening of new candidates for exudative AMD.

Fecal alpha1-proteinase inhibitor (α1-PI) concentration has been to diagnose
enteric protein loss in dogs and cats. Chronic lymphocytic enteritis is commonly 
seen in the marmoset (Callithrix jaccus) and is characterized by hypoalbuminemia.
As a prelude to immunoassay development for detecting enteric protein loss,
marmoset serum α1-PI was purified using immunoaffinity chromatography and ceramic
hydroxyapatite chromatography. Partial characterization was performed by reducing
gel electrophoresis and enzyme inhibitory assays. Protein identity was confirmed 
with peptide mass fingerprinting and N-terminal amino acid sequencing. Molecular 
mass, relative molecular mass, and isoelectric point for marmoset α1-PI were
54 kDa, 51,677, and 4.8-5.4, respectively. Trypsin, chymotrypsin, and elastase
inhibitory activity were observed. N-terminal amino acid sequence for marmoset
α1-PI was EDPQGDAAQKMDTSHH. In conclusion, marmoset α1-PI was successfully
purified from serum with an overall yield of 12% using a rapid and efficient
method. Purified marmoset α1-PI has characteristics similar to those of α1-PI
reported for other species.

Common marmosets show social plasticity and group-level similarity in
personality.

The social environment influences animal personality on evolutionary and
immediate time scales. However, studies of animal personality rarely assess the
effects of the social environment, particularly in species that live in stable
groups with individualized relationships. We assessed personality experimentally 
in 17 individuals of the common marmoset, living in four groups. We found their
personality to be considerably modified by the social environment. Marmosets
exhibited relatively high plasticity in their behaviour, and showed
'group-personality', i.e. group-level similarity in the personality traits. In
exploratory behaviour this was maintained only in the social environment but not 
when individuals were tested alone, suggesting that exploration tendency is
subjected to social facilitation. Boldness, in contrast, showed higher
consistency across the social and solitary conditions, and the group-level
similarity in trait scores was sustained also outside of the immediate social
environment. The 'group-personality' was not due to genetic relatedness,
supporting that it was produced by social effects. We hypothesize that
'group-personality' may be adaptive for highly cooperative animals through
facilitating cooperation among individuals with similar behavioural tendency.

The common marmoset, Callithrix jacchus, is used as a New World monkey species in
biomedical studies because of its small body size and good reproduction in
captivity. A modified artificial insemination technique was developed in this
species to encourage breeding of lines carrying interesting genes and traits.
Fresh semen was collected by penile vibratory stimulation. Medium containing
highly motile sperm was inseminated into the uterus using a catheter. Seven
females were inseminated using freshly prepared sperm from different males every 
day for 3 days including the expected ovulation day. As a result, four females
conceived, and three females delivered six offspring in total (two singletons and
one quadruplet). The paternity of the newborns was determined using
microsatellite markers to accurately pinpoint the timing of insemination and
ovulation. It is expected that our artificial insemination protocol can be
effectively used to establish marmoset lines and genetically manage marmoset
colonies.

The aim of the present study was to critically evaluate the effect of different
concentrations of estradiol (E2) during IVM of common marmoset (Callithrix
jacchus) oocytes from antral follicles. The doses tested were 0, 0.1, 1, or 10
μg/mL E2 (referred to as 0 E2, 0.1 E2, 1 E2, and 10 E2 groups). After a
preincubation, the concentration of E2 in IVM drops under oil was approximately
20% of the amount added (0.02; 0.2 and 1.9 μg/mL, respectively) because of
absorption into the oil. Oocyte progression to metaphase II was significantly
higher in the 0.1 E2 group than that in the absence of E2. With progressively
higher doses, the maturation rate tended to decrease suggesting an overdose
effect. Furthermore, the total first cleavage rate was significantly higher in
the 0.1 E2 group than that in the 0 E2 group and decreased progressively with
further increases in E2 concentration, with the 10 E2 group showing the same low 
rate as without E2. The oocytes which failed to cleave, after maturation in 10
E2, showed obvious signs of overdose with the highest rates of degeneration and
abnormal spindle form, and an absence of embryo progression. In contrast to these
obvious negative effects on the oocyte, 10 E2 was the only group in which a
significant increase in radial cumulus expansion was observed. The concentration 
0.1 E2, which is 10 times lower than the most commonly used E2 dose, produced the
best results in all oocyte factors evaluated. These results represent the first

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) has been valuable as a primate model in 
biomedical research. Interest in this species has grown recently, in part due to 
the successful demonstration of transgenic marmosets. Here we examine the
prospects of the marmoset model for visual neuroscience research, adopting a
comparative framework to place the marmoset within a broader evolutionary
context. The marmoset's small brain bears most of the organizational features of 
other primates, and its smooth surface offers practical advantages over the
macaque for areal mapping, laminar electrode penetration, and two-photon and
optical imaging. Behaviorally, marmosets are more limited at performing
regimented psychophysical tasks, but do readily accept the head restraint that is
necessary for accurate eye tracking and neurophysiology, and can perform simple
discriminations. Their natural gaze behavior closely resembles that of other
primates, with a tendency to focus on objects of social interest including faces.
Their immaturity at birth and routine twinning also makes them ideal for the
study of postnatal visual development. These experimental factors, together with 
the theoretical advantages inherent in comparing anatomy, physiology, and
behavior across related species, make the marmoset an excellent model for visual 
neuroscience.

Genetically modified mice have contributed much to studies in the life sciences. 
In some research fields, however, mouse models are insufficient for analyzing the
molecular mechanisms of pathology or as disease models. Often, genetically
modified non-human primate (NHP) models are desired, as they are more similar to 
human physiology, morphology, and anatomy. Recent progress in studies of the
reproductive biology in NHPs has enabled the introduction of exogenous genes into
NHP genomes or the alteration of endogenous NHP genes. This review summarizes
recent progress in the production of genetically modified NHPs, including the
common marmoset, and future perspectives for realizing genetically modified NHP
models for use in life sciences research.

[Morphological and functional diversity of retinal ganglion cells in the common
marmoset].

[Article in Japanese]

Retinal ganglion cells are projecting neurons that send visual information from
the retina to the brain. They generate different patterns of action potentials in
response to different kinds of visual information. In the retinas of mammals such
as mice or rabbits, there are functionally and morphologically diverse retinal
ganglion cells. However, in the primate retina, midget and parasol cells are
believed to be dominant, and show less diversity. In this study, we performed
organotypic culture of retinas and acute gene transfection of GFPs by gene-gun.
We found more diverse retinal ganglion cells, including directional selective
ganglion cells, than we expected, even in the retinas of primates such as common 
marmosets. Further, we found a third pathway from the retina to the brain via the
thalamus, in addition to the magnocellular and parvocellular pathways.

Common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) monkeys when compared to rhesus macaques
(Macaca mullatta) present several advantages for disease modeling, especially
transgenic initiatives, as they commonly give birth to twins, which increases
sample size, have accelerated development and a shorter life span that
facilitates the analysis of the onset of age-related diseases. Yet, no tools are 
currently available to assess marmoset neurodevelopment during the initial first 
month of life. Here we report the creation of a novel Primate Postnatal
Neurobehavioral Assessment Scale for marmoset monkeys (PPNAS-M) that was based on
currently available scales for human and rhesus monkeys. Twenty-four healthy
marmoset infants (12 females, 12 males) from 12 families were evaluated. The
infant assessments involved 10-minute testing administered at 15 and 30 days
after birth. The PPNAS-M consists of 41 noninvasive tests grouped into 5 testing 
categories: visual orienting, auditory and spatial orienting, motor responses,
righting and body strength, and temperament tests. Testing at these two ages did 
not affect the overall health of the infants, suggesting that the PPNAS-M is a
non-invasive testing tool. Significant maturation was demonstrated by increased
scores in each of the five testing categories from postnatal day 15 to 30, with
developmental patterns unique to marmosets. Principal component analysis defined 
4 item groups (Orientation, State Control, Motor Maturity and Sensory
Sensitivity) with 5 variables each. Orientation and State Control factors were
highly similar to each other at both ages and correlated highly with previous
item groupings used with rhesus macaques. Our results indicate that the PPNAS-M
is a useful assessment tool for detecting neuromotor, attention, and temperament 
status of infant marmosets and that it is sensitive to developmental effects.
Further studies to validate the PPNAS-M for the assessment of normal development 
versus early effects of developmental perturbations associated to prenatal
exposures and transgenesis are warranted.

An 8-month-old common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) was presented with tic-like
symptoms, and a 2-year-old pigmy marmoset (Callithrix pygmaea) was presented with
dyspnea and hypersalivation. Both monkeys died within a few days, and necropsies 
were performed. Histopathological examinations revealed ulcerative stomatitis
with epithelial cell swelling and eosinophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies in
the oral epithelium of both cases. In the central and peripheral nervous systems,
neuronal cell degeneration with intranuclear inclusion bodies was observed.
Immunohistochemical examination using anti-herpes simplex virus type 1 antibody
revealed virus antigens in both cases. Both animals had been kept as pets with
limited exposure to the ambient environment except via their owners. Therefore,
herpes simplex virus type-1 was probably acquired from close contact with their
owners.

Mammalian spermatogenesis has been investigated extensively in rodents and a
strictly controlled developmental process has been defined at cellular and
molecular levels. In comparison, primate spermatogenesis has been far less well
characterized. However, important differences between primate and rodent
spermatogenesis are emerging so it is not always accurate to extrapolate findings
in rodents to primate systems. Here, we performed an extensive immunofluorescence
study of spermatogenesis in neonatal, juvenile, and adult testes in the common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) to determine primate-specific patterns of gene
expression that underpin primate germ cell development. Initially we
characterized adult spermatogonia into two main classes; mitotically active
C-KIT(+)Ki67(+) cells and mitotically quiescent SALL4(+)PLZF(+)LIN28(+)DPPA4(+)
cells. We then explored the expression of a set of markers, including
PIWIL1/MARWI, VASA, DAZL, CLGN, RanBPM, SYCP1 and HAPRIN, during germ cell
differentiation from early spermatocytes through round and elongating spermatids,
and a clear program of gene expression changes was determined as development
proceeded. We then examined the juvenile marmoset testis. Markers of gonocytes
demonstrated two populations; one that migrates to the basal membrane where they 
form the SALL4(+) or C-KIT(+) spermatogonia, and another that remains in the
lumen of the seminiferous tubule. This later population, historically identified 
as pre-spermatogonia, expressed meiotic and apoptotic markers and were eliminated
because they appear to have failed to correctly migrate. Our findings provide the
first platform of gene expression dynamics in adult and developing germ cells of 
the common marmoset. Although we have characterized a limited number of genes,
these results will facilitate primate spermatogenesis research and understanding 
of human reproduction.

The cerebral cortex of humans and macaques has specialized regions for processing
faces and other visual stimulus categories. It is unknown whether a similar
functional organization exists in New World monkeys, such as the common marmoset 
(Callithrix jacchus), a species of growing interest as a primate model in
neuroscience. To address this question, we measured selective neural responses in
the brain of four awake marmosets trained to fix their gaze upon images of faces,
bodies, objects, and control patterns. In two of the subjects, we measured high
gamma-range field potentials from electrocorticography arrays implanted over a
large portion of the occipital and inferotemporal cortex. In the other two
subjects, we measured BOLD fMRI responses across the entire brain. Both
techniques revealed robust, regionally specific patterns of category-selective
neural responses. We report that at least six face-selective patches mark the
occipitotemporal pathway of the marmoset, with the most anterior patches showing 
the strongest preference for faces over other stimuli. The similar appearance of 
these patches to previous findings in macaques and humans, including their
apparent arrangement in two parallel pathways, suggests that core elements of the
face processing network were present in the common anthropoid primate ancestor
living ∼35 million years ago. The findings also identify the marmoset as a viable
animal model system for studying specialized neural mechanisms related to
high-level social visual perception in humans.

The marmoset spinal cord possesses all the characteristic features of a typical
mammalian spinal cord, but with some interesting variation in the levels of
origin of the limb nerves. In our study Nissl and ChAT sections of the each
segment of the spinal cord in two marmosets (Ma5 and Ma8), we found that the
spinal cord can be functionally and anatomically divided into six regions: the
prebrachial region (C1 to C3); the brachial region (C4 to C8) - segments
supplying the upper limb; the post-brachial region (T1 to L1) - containing the
sympathetic outflow, and supplying the hypaxial muscles of the body wall; the
crural region (L2 to L5) - segments supplying the lower limb; the postcrural
region (L6) - containing the parasympathetic outflow; and the caudal region (L7
to Co4) - supplying the tail. In the rat, mouse, and rhesus monkey, the
prebrachial region consists of segments C1 to C4 (with the phrenic nucleus
located at the C4 segment), and the brachial region extends from C5 to T1
inclusive. The prefixing of the upper limb outflow in these two marmosets mirrors
the finding in the literature that a large C4 contribution to the brachial plexus
is common in humans.

The olfactory system has been well studied in mammals such as mice and rats.
However, few studies have focused on characterizing this system in diurnal
primates that rely on their sense of smell to a lesser extent due to their
ecological environment. In the present study, we determined the histological
organization of the olfactory bulb in the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).
We then constructed 3-dimensional models of the glomeruli of the olfactory bulb, 
and estimated the number of glomeruli. Olfactory glomeruli are the functional
units of olfactory processing, and have been investigated in detail using mice.
There are approximately 1800 glomeruli in a mouse hemibulb, and olfactory sensory
neurons expressing one selected olfactory receptor converge onto one or two
glomeruli. Because mice have about 1000 olfactory receptor genes, it is proposed 
that the number of glomeruli in mammals is nearly double that of olfactory
receptor genes. The common marmoset carries only about 400 intact olfactory
receptor genes. The present study revealed that the number of glomeruli in a
marmoset hemibulb was approximately 1500-1800. This result suggests that the
number of glomeruli is not positively correlated with the number of intact
olfactory receptor genes in mammals.

Positron emission tomography (PET) is a molecular imaging modality that can
visualize functional neurochemical processes throughout the brain in the living
condition, and is useful in bridging the gap between experimental animals and
humans. We applied PET to common marmosets to study the brain mechanisms
underlying social behaviors. Common marmosets are known for their high level of
sociality within a cooperative breeding system, which is rare among non-human
primates, and they could represent valuable animals for studying human-like
social behaviors. PET successfully revealed a brain-molecular relationship
underlying social traits and a functional brain network associated with social
situations in common marmosets. Marmoset PET appears likely to prove useful in
understanding the neurobiological mechanisms underpinning social behaviors in
both physiological and pathological conditions, and has potential for simulating 
psychiatric disorders.

A mini-atlas of the brain is designed to help students and young researchers who 
are not familiar with neuroanatomy. In the mini-atlas, a limited number of
important nuclei and fiber tracts are shown on a small number of brain sections
from posterior end to the anterior end of the brain. The first mini-atlas was
introduced for the rat brain (Watson et al., 2010). Here we present a mini-atlas 
of the common marmoset (Callithrix jaccus), which is one of representative
experimental primates for modern neuroscience. We further discuss the differences
of brain structures between rodents and primates.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus, C. j.) is an established primate model
in biomedical research and for human-related diseases. Monitoring of
cardiovascular parameters including blood pressure (BP) is important for the
health surveillance of these experimental animals and the quantification of
diseases or pharmaceutical substances influencing BP. Measurement guidelines for 
C. j. do not exist yet; therefore, the present study was carried out to establish
a practicable protocol based on recommendations of the American College of
Veterinary Internal Medicine (ACVIM). Furthermore, BP data of 49 marmosets
(13.8-202.4 months of age) were obtained via high-definition oscillometry to
further knowledge of physiological parameters and gender-related differences in
this primate. The thighs proved to be the most suitable measurement localization,
since systolic values were less variable (left 4.03 ± 2.90%, right 5.96 ± 2.77%) 
compared with the tail (12.7 ± 6.96%). BP values were similar in the morning and 
in the afternoon (P > 0.05). Data were highly reproducible within and between
several sessions on three consecutive days (P > 0.05) as well as over the course 
of 20 months (P > 0.05). Furthermore, the measurement time for females was
significantly shorter than for males (5:14 ± 1:59 min versus 6:50 ± 1:58 min, P =
0.007). Measurement recommendations for the common marmoset were successfully
established. Standardized values enabled a reliable comparison of BP parameters, 
e.g. for cardiovascular, toxicological or metabolic research.

Many industrial chemicals and their respective by-products need to be
comprehensively evaluated for toxicity using reliable and efficient assays. In
terms of teratogenicity evaluations, the murine-based embryonic stem cell test
(EST) offers a promising solution to screen for multiple tissue endpoints.
However, use of a mouse model in the EST can yield only a limited understanding
of human development, anatomy, and physiology. Non-human primate or human in
vitro models have been suggested to be a pharmacologically and
pathophysiologically desirable alternative to murine in vitro models. Here, we
comparatively evaluated the sensitivity of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) of a
non-human primate to skeletal teratogens with mouse ESCs hypothesizing that
inclusion of non-human primate cells in in vitro tests would increase the
reliability of safety predictions for humans. First, osteogenic capacity was
compared between ESCs from the mouse and a New World monkey, the common marmoset.
Then, cells were treated with compounds that have been previously reported to
induce bone teratogenicity. Calcification and MTT assays evaluated effects on
osteogenesis and cell viability, respectively. Our data indicated that marmoset
ESCs responded differently than mouse ESCs in such embryotoxicity screens with no
obvious dependency on chemical or compound classes and thus suggest that
embryotoxicity screening results could be affected by species-driven response
variation. In addition, ESCs derived from rhesus monkey, an Old World monkey, and
phylogenetically closer to humans than the marmoset, were observed to respond
differently to test compounds than marmoset ESCs. Together these results indicate
that there are significant differences in the responses of non-human primate and 
mouse ESC to embryotoxic agents.

Despite the importance that concepts of arboreal stability have in theories of
primate locomotor evolution, we currently lack measures of balance performance
during primate locomotion. We provide the first quantitative data on locomotor
stability in an arboreal primate, the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus),
predicting that primates should maximize arboreal stability by minimizing
side-to-side angular momentum about the support (i.e., Lsup ). If net Lsup
becomes excessive, the animal will be unable to arrest its angular movement and
will fall. Using a novel, highly integrative experimental procedure we directly
measured whole-body Lsup in two adult marmosets moving along narrow (2.5 cm
diameter) and broad (5 cm diameter) poles. Marmosets showed a strong preference
for asymmetrical gaits (e.g., gallops and bounds) over symmetrical gaits (e.g.,
walks and runs), with asymmetrical gaits representing >90% of all strides.
Movement on the narrow support was associated with an increase in more "grounded"
gaits (i.e., lacking an aerial phase) and a more even distribution of torque
production between the fore- and hind limbs. These adjustments in gait dynamics
significantly reduced net Lsup on the narrow support relative to the broad
support. Despite their lack of a well-developed grasping apparatus, marmosets
proved adept at producing muscular "grasping" torques about the support,
particularly with the hind limbs. We contend that asymmetrical gaits permit
small-bodied arboreal mammals, including primates, to expand "effective grasp" by
gripping the substrate between left and right limbs of a girdle. This model of
arboreal stability may hold important implications for understanding primate
locomotor evolution.

The adenosine A2A receptor antagonist, istradefylline, enhances anti-parkinsonian
activity in patients with advanced Parkinson׳s disease (PD) already treated with 
combinations of L-DOPA and dopamine agonist drugs but who are still exhibiting
prolonged 'OFF' periods. In contrast, the effects of istradefylline on motor
function when administered in combination with low dose dopamine agonist therapy 
in early PD are unknown. We now investigate whether istradefylline administered
with a threshold dose of either the non-ergot dopamine agonist, ropinirole or the
ergot dopamine agonist, pergolide enhances anti-parkinsonian activity in the
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated common marmoset. Both
ropinirole (0.01-0.1mg/kg p.o.) and pergolide (0.003-0.1mg/kg p.o.) administered 
alone produced dose dependent increases in locomotor activity, a reduction in
motor disability. Threshold doses of ropinirole (0.025-0.075mg/kg p.o.) and
pergolide (0.01-0.075mg/kg p.o.) were then selected that in individual animals
caused a small but non-significant anti-parkinsonian effect. Administration of
istradefylline (10mg/kg p.o.) alone resulted in a decrease in motor disability
and increase in 'ON' time but dyskinesia was not observed. Combined
administration of pergolide or ropinirole with istradefylline resulted in an
increase in the reversal of motor disability and increase in 'ON' time compared
to that produced by either treatment alone but dyskinesia was still not observed.
These results show that istradefylline is effective in improving motor function
when combined with low dose dopamine agonist treatment. In early PD, this may
avoid dose escalation or allow a reduction in dopamine agonist dosage without a
loss of efficacy and prevent dopaminergic side-effects from becoming treatment
limiting.

Glanders and melioidosis are caused by two distinct Burkholderia species and have
generally been considered to have similar disease progression. While both of
these pathogens are HHS/CDC Tier 1 agents, natural infection with both these
pathogens is primarily through skin inoculation. The common marmoset (Callithrix 
jacchus) was used to compare disease following experimental subcutaneous
challenge. Acute, lethal disease was observed in marmosets following challenge
with between 26 and 1.2 × 10(8) cfu Burkholderia pseudomallei within 22-85 h. The
reproducibility and progression of the disease were assessed following a
challenge of 1 × 10(2) cfu of B. pseudomallei. Melioidosis was characterised by
high levels of bacteraemia, focal microgranuloma progressing to non-necrotic
multifocal solid lesions in the livers and spleens and multi-organ failure.
Lethal disease was observed in 93% of animals challenged with Burkholderia
mallei, occurring between 5 and 10.6 days. Following challenge with 1 × 10(2) cfu
of B. mallei, glanders was characterised with lymphatic spread of the bacteria
and non-necrotic, multifocal solid lesions progressing to a multifocal lesion
with severe necrosis and pneumonia. The experimental results confirmed that the
disease pathology and presentation is strikingly different between the two
pathogens. The marmoset provides a model of the human syndrome for both diseases 
facilitating the development of medical countermeasures.

White matter (WM) impairment and motor deficit after stroke are directly related.
However, WM injury mechanisms and their relation to motor disturbances are still 
poorly understood. In humans, the anterior choroidal artery (AChA) irrigates the 
internal capsule (IC), and stroke to this region can induce isolated motor
impairment. The goal of this study was to analyze whether AChA occlusion can
injure the IC in the marmoset monkey. The vascular distribution of the marmoset
brain was examined by colored latex perfusion and revealed high resemblance to
the human brain anatomy. Next, a new approach to electrocoagulate the AChA was
developed and chronic experiments showed infarction compromising the IC on
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning (day 4) and histology (day 11).
Behavioral analysis was performed using a neurologic score previously developed
and our own scoring method. Marmosets showed a decreased score that was still
evident at day 10 after AChA electrocoagulation. We developed a new approach able
to induce damage to the marmoset IC that may be useful for the detailed study of 
WM impairment and behavioral changes after stroke in the nonhuman primate.

The cerebral cortex is an indispensable region that is involved in higher
cognitive function in the mammalian brain, and is particularly evolved in the
primate brain. It has been demonstrated that cortical areas are formed by both
innate and activity-dependent mechanisms. However, it remains unknown what
molecular changes induce cortical expansion and complexity during primate
evolution. Active DNA methylation/demethylation is one of the epigenetic
mechanisms that can modify gene expression via the methylation/demethylation of
promoter regions. Three growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible small nuclear
proteins, Gadd45 alpha, beta, and gamma, have been identified as regulators of
methylation status. To understand the involvement of epigenetic factors in
primate cortical evolution, we started by analyzing expression of these
demethylation genes in the developing common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) and
mouse (Mus musculus) brain. In the marmoset brain, we found that cortical
expression levels of Gadd45 alpha and gamma were reduced during development,
whereas there was high expression of Gadd45 beta in some areas of the adult
brain, including the prefrontal, temporal, posterior parietal and insula
cortices, which are particularly expanded in greater primates and humans.
Compared to the marmoset brain, there were no clear regional differences and
constant or reduced Gadd45 expression was seen between juvenile and adult mouse
brain. Double staining with a neuronal marker revealed that most
Gadd45-expressing cells were NeuN-positive neurons. Thus, these results suggest
the possibility that differential Gadd45 expression affects neurons, contributing
cortical evolution and diversity.

l-DOPA is the gold standard for treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). However,
the drug produces some serious side effects, including dyskinesia, which is
characterized by repetitive involuntary movements-including chorea. In the
present preclinical study using a nonhuman primate model, dyskinesia caused by
repeated l-DOPA administration was investigated in the context of behavioral
sensitization by objectively quantifying motor activity in the common marmoset of
PD model (the Parkinsonian marmoset). Twelve male Parkinsonian marmosets
previously treated with MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) and
six intact male marmosets were used. The motor activity of each marmoset was
measured using infrared sensors attached to each individual living cage.
Parkinsonian marmosets (n=6) exhibited behavioral sensitization (enhanced motor
activity) in 10weeks upon oral administration of l-DOPA (10mg/kg per day on
3days/week). These animals also exhibited dyskinesia characterized by repetitive 
rapid movements including chorea in 6-10weeks. Neither behavioral sensitization
nor dyskinesia was observed in Parkinsonian marmosets given vehicle and in intact
marmosets given l-DOPA at the same dose (both n=6 each). Behavioral sensitization
was detected sensitively and objectively on motor activity only in Parkinsonian
marmosets given repeated l-DOPA at a similar dose used in PD patients. The
behavioral feature of the marmosets was dyskinesia similar to that of PD patients
but appeared earlier than would be manifested in humans. In spite of
statistically significant behavioral sensitization, some marmosets did not
exhibit dyskinesia in the present limited l-DOPA administration period. Although 
both commonalities and differences may exist between behavioral sensitization and
dyskinesia, behavioral sensitization is considered to be an objective,
quantitative, sensitive and predictive measure of behavioral mechanism underlying
dyskinesia in preclinical studies in evaluating compounds.

Recently, pathophysiology of human psychiatry originates from abnormal numbers of
synapses/spines. There are generally two-types of development of spines from
birth depending on species. One is, after birth, synaptogenesis occurs, and there
is a clear peak of spines, and then rapidly pruning occurring, which are called
"overshoot-type" of development of synapses/spines. Primates including human
belong to this type. In other type including rodents, even after a peak, general 
number of spines does not decrease so much. Although these differences, most of
human psychiatric models have been genetic modified rodents. Now, transgenic
primate (the common marmoset) became available. In near future, we can, examine
pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders using this animal model, which is closer
to human being. To begin with this endeavor, we should know how synapses/spines
of normal marmosets developed, and molecular mechanisms of "overshoot-type" of
spine development, which human being also shows. Here, we will present our recent
effort to explore these questions, and future experiments will be discussed.

Dense understory and absence of capuchin monkeys (Sapajus xanthosternos) predict

Understanding the effects of habitat structure and other environmental variables 
on the density of a species can help define its habitat preferences and key
ecological determinants of population parameters. The present study evaluated the
effects of fragment size, the presence of a key predator/competitor, the
yellow-breasted capuchin (Sapajus xanthosternos), primary productivity, the
abundance of bromeliads, and habitat structure on the population density of the
common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). A total of 21 fragments were surveyed
within a 350-km long zone of coastal Atlantic Forest representing the southern
extreme of the distribution of the species in the Brazilian Northeast. An index
of marmoset density was generated for each site based on playback surveys. The
relationship between the density of marmosets and a set of parameters was
evaluated by multiple regression. A Principal Components Analysis (PCA) condensed
the five variables of habitat structure into two principal components, which
contained 85% of their combined variation. The model that best explained the
density of marmosets (R(2) = 59.1) contained the second PCA component and the
presence/absence of capuchins. The analysis indicated that the marmosets prefer
forests with denser understory, whether or not they are secondary habitats. The
negative effect of the presence of capuchins may be related to predation
pressure. The results of this study indicate that multiple-site studies may
provide important insights into the habitat preferences of primate species and
the factors that affect their population density.

The following is a report on a congenital vaginal malformation, imperforate
vagina, in the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). This anomaly was observed
for the first time in an adult female in our research colony. There was no
uterine and vaginal aplasia or atresia in her grossly normal genital tract. The
plasma progesterone concentration suggested that the ovarian cycle had ceased.
However, this may not be related to a functional anomaly, but rather to
suppressed ovulation resulting from subordination to cagemates considering the
various stages of follicular development observed.

To assess the relevance and availability of subtotal nephrectomized common
marmoset monkeys as a chronic renal failure (CRF) model, we observed for 26 weeks
the pathophysiological condition of female marmosets subjected to five-sixth
surgical nephrectomy (5/6Nx) by a two-step surgical method. The 5/6Nx marmosets
showed a significant increase in serum levels of urea nitrogen, creatinine and
cystatin-C immediately after 5/6Nx surgery. These renal disorder parameters
subsequently tended to decrease with the passage of time but remained higher than
the control levels by the end of the study. Hyperplastic parathyroid glands, a
high turnover state of osteodystrophy in the femoral bone with higher serum ALP
activity and anemia with hypocellularity of bone marrow were evident. The 5/6Nx
marmosets showed a stable CRF condition for a long time and some characteristic
disorders similar to those observed in CRF patients. These diagnostic aspects
might be a species-specific anatomical and physiological signature, reflecting
the nutritional condition. The CRF model using 5/6Nx marmosets might become a
useful method of evaluating the unique mechanism of CRF development.

Although there has been great interest in the evolutionary approach to
cooperative breeding species, few studies actually directly compare fathers and
mothers on their motivation to parent offspring. We tested the responsiveness of 
common marmoset mothers and fathers to vocal and olfactory cues from their own
and other infants using a two-chamber test apparatus designed to evaluate
responses in the absence of competition from other caregivers within the family. 
We tested parentally experienced mothers and fathers living with young infants
and former parents with no current offspring to address the following questions: 
(1) do mothers and fathers respond equally to sensory cues of infants; (2) do
parents discriminate cues of their own offspring when the infants are highly
dependent and when the infants are more independent; and (3) are parents
responsive to both auditory and olfactory cues? Mothers and fathers reacted
similarly in all tests. Parents responded equally to isolation calls from their
own and unfamiliar dependent infants and there was minimal response to olfactory 
cues. Responses to infant vocal cues were significantly stronger when infants
were dependent upon direct parental care. There was no difference in response
between parents whose infants were no longer dependent and former parents with no
current offspring. The results show that both parents are highly responsive to
infant vocal cues when their own infants are dependent on parental care,
supporting an effect of hormonal priming. However, parents only showed
behavioural discrimination between vocalizations from their own and unfamiliar
infants when their infants were mostly independent.

As a diurnal experimental primate, the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) has
recently contributed to numerous kinds of studies of neurobiological psychiatry
as an essential pre-clinical model. The marmoset matures sexually within one or
two years after birth. Thus, we can observe how the primate learns and develops
psycho-cognitive functions through experiences in experimental environment for a 
much shorter period compared to that of humans. Longer daylight exposure may
affect psychological development of children. In our research, we focus on
raising marmosets under constant daylight from birth until various ages. In order
to quantitatively evaluate the development of higher-ordered psychological
functions, we designed a system of socio-behavioral tests and multivariate
correlation analysis methods based on principal component analysis. With
reference to the call and typical body movement expressed during a particular
social context, we statistically inferred the emotional features of the subjects.
In the current literature, we review our published results showing increased
alert behaviors by constant light, and then, attempted to extend our additional
analysis to seek age-dependent susceptibility to constant light. We then present 
the neurobiological mechanisms with reference to previous research reports. The
current review suggests possible existence of a susceptible period earlier than
three to five month-old in the environment-induced developmental disorder model, 
supposedly like attention deficit hyperactive disorders (ADHD) or oppositional
defiant disorder (ODD).

The middle temporal visual area (MT, also known as V5) is a visual association
area that is particularly evolved in the primate brain. The MT receives input
from the primary visual area (V1), constitutes part of the dorsal visual pathway,
and plays an essential role in processing motion. Connections between the MT and 
V1 in the primate brain are formed after birth, and are related to the maturation
of visual system. However, it remains to be determined what molecular mechanisms 
control the formation and maturation of the visual system. Cadherins are
transmembrane proteins, originally isolated as cell adhesion molecules, which
have multiple roles in synapse formation and function. To investigate potential
involvement of cadherins in development of the primate visual system, we examined
type II cadherin expression (cadherin-6, -8, -12) in cortical and thalamic visual
areas of pre- and postnatal brains of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).
In the prenatal brain, cadherin-6 was dominantly expressed in the pulvino-MT
pathway whereas cadherin-8 was dominant in the lateral geniculate nucleus
(LGN)-V1 pathway. During postnatal development, there was a downregulation of
cadherin-6 and upregulation of cadherin-8 expression in the MT. The timing of
this cadherin exchange preceded the development of V1-MT connections. Our results
suggest the possibility that changes in cadherin expression are involved in the
development of the primate visual system, and that a switch in cadherin
expression may be a general mechanism to control neural plasticity of highly
cognitive abilities.

Globally, there is an increasing interest in brain-mapping projects, including
the Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN)
Initiative project in the USA, the Human Brain Project (HBP) in Europe, and the
Brain Mapping by Integrated Neurotechnologies for Disease Studies (Brain/MINDS)
project in Japan. These projects aim to map the structure and function of
neuronal circuits to ultimately understand the vast complexity of the human
brain. Brain/MINDS is focused on structural and functional mapping of the common 
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) brain. This non-human primate has numerous
advantages for brain mapping, including a well-developed frontal cortex and a
compact brain size, as well as the availability of transgenic technologies. In
the present review article, we discuss strategies for structural and functional
mapping of the marmoset brain and the relation of the common marmoset to other
animals models.

Alginate cell-based therapy requires further development focused on clinical
application. To assess engraftment, risk of mutations and therapeutic benefit
studies should be performed in an appropriate non-human primate model, such as
the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). In this work we encapsulated amnion
derived multipotent stromal cells (MSCs) from Callithrix jacchus in defined size 
alginate beads using a high voltage technique. Our results indicate that i)
alginate-cell mixing procedure and cell concentration do not affect the diameter 
of alginate beads, ii) encapsulation of high cell numbers (up to 10×106 cells/ml)
can be performed in alginate beads utilizing high voltage and iii) high voltage
(15-30 kV) does not alter the viability, proliferation and differentiation
capacity of MSCs post-encapsulation compared with alginate encapsulated cells
produced by the traditional air-flow method. The consistent results were obtained
over the period of 7 days of encapsulated MSCs culture and after cryopreservation
utilizing a slow cooling procedure (1 K/min). The results of this work show that 
high voltage encapsulation can further be maximized to develop cell-based
therapies with alginate beads in a non-human primate model towards human
application.

Convergent evolution of vocal cooperation without convergent evolution of brain
size.

Borjon JI(1), Ghazanfar AA.

Author information:

One pragmatic underlying successful vocal communication is the ability to take
turns. Taking turns - a form of cooperation - facilitates the transmission of
signals by reducing the amount of their overlap. This allows vocalizations to be 
better heard. Until recently, non-human primates were not thought of as
particularly cooperative, especially in the vocal domain. We recently
demonstrated that common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus), a small New World
primate species, take turns when they exchange vocalizations with both related
and unrelated conspecifics. As the common marmoset is distantly related to humans
(and there is no documented evidence that Old World primates exhibit vocal turn
taking), we argue that this ability arose as an instance of convergent evolution,
and is part of a suite of prosocial behavioral tendencies. Such behaviors seem to
be, at least in part, the outcome of the cooperative breeding strategy adopted by
both humans and marmosets. Importantly, this suite of shared behaviors occurs
without correspondence in encephalization. Marmoset vocal turn taking
demonstrates that a large brain size and complex cognitive machinery is not
needed for vocal cooperation to occur. Consistent with this idea, the temporal
structure of marmoset vocal exchanges can be described in terms of coupled
oscillator dynamics, similar to quantitative descriptions of human conversations.
We propose a simple neural circuit mechanism that may account for these dynamics 
and, at its core, involves vocalization-induced reductions of arousal. Such a
mechanism may underlie the evolution of vocal turn taking in both marmoset
monkeys and humans.

Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating neurological injury. At present,
pharmacological, regenerative, and rehabilitative approaches are widely studied
as therapeutic interventions for motor recovery after SCI. Preclinical research
has been performed on model animals with experimental SCI, and those studies
often evaluate hand and arm motor function using various indices, such as the
success rate of the single pellet reaching test and the grip force. However,
compensatory movement strategies, involuntary muscle contraction, and the
subject's motivation could affect the scores, resulting in failure to assess
direct recovery from impairment. Identifying appropriate assessments of motor
impairment is thus important for understanding the mechanisms of motor recovery. 
In this study, we developed a motion capture system capable of reconstructing
three-dimensional hand positions with millimeter and millisecond accuracy and
evaluated hand kinematics during food retrieval movement in both healthy and
hemispinalized common marmosets. As a result, the endpoint jerk, representing the
accuracy of hand motor control, was asserted to be an appropriate index of upper 
limb motor impairment by eliminating the influence of the subject's motivation,
involuntary muscle contraction, and compensatory strategies. The result also
suggested that the kinematics of the limb more consistently reflects motor
restoration from deficit due to spinal cord injury than the performance in the
single pellet reaching test. Because of recent attention devoted to the common
marmoset as a nonhuman primate model for human diseases, the present study, which
clarified arm-reaching movements in spinalized marmosets, provides fundamental
knowledge for future therapeutic studies.

BACKGROUND: Nonhuman primates are important for both biomedical studies and
understanding human evolution. Although research in these areas has mostly
focused on Old World primates, such as the rhesus macaque, the common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus), a New World primate, offers important advantages in
comparison to other primates, such as an accelerated lifespan. To conduct Next
Generation expression studies or to study primate evolution, a high quality
annotation of the marmoset genome is required. The availability of marmoset
transcriptome data from five tissues, including both raw sequences and assembled 
transcripts, will aid in the annotation of the newly released marmoset assembly.
FINDINGS: RNA WAS EXTRACTED FROM FIVE TISSUES: skeletal muscle, bladder and
hippocampus from a male common marmoset, and cerebral cortex and cerebellum from 
a female common marmoset. All five RNA samples were sequenced on the Illumina
HiSeq 2000 platform. Sequences were deposited in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive. 
Transcripts were assembled, annotated and deposited in the NCBI Transcriptome
Shotgun Assembly database.
CONCLUSIONS: We have provided a high quality annotation of 51,163 transcripts
with full-length coding sequence. This set represented a total of 10,833 unique
genes. In addition to providing empirical support for the existence of these
10,833 genes, we also provide sequence information for 2,422 genes that were not 
previously identified in the Ensembl annotation of the marmoset genome.

Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in the common marmoset, a
small-bodied Neotropical primate, is a well-known and validated animal model for 
multiple sclerosis (MS). This model can be used for exploratory research, i.e.,
investigating the pathogenic mechanisms involved in MS, and applied research,
testing the efficacy of new potential drugs.In this chapter, we will describe a
method to induce EAE in the marmoset. In addition, we will explain the most
common immunological techniques involved in the marmoset EAE research, namely
isolation of mononuclear cells (MNC) from peripheral blood and lymphoid tissue,
assaying T cell proliferation by thymidine incorporation, MNC phenotyping by flow
cytometry, antibody measurement by ELISA, generation of B cell lines and
antigen-specific T cell lines, and assaying cytotoxic T cells.

Vocalizations of common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) were examined under
experimental situations related to fear or anxiety. When marmosets were isolated 
in an unfamiliar environment, they frequently vocalized "tsik-egg" calls, which
were the combination calls of 'tsik' followed by several 'egg'. Tsik-egg calls
were also observed after treatment with the anxiogenic drug FG-7142 (20mg/kg,
sc). In contrast, when marmosets were exposed to predatory stimuli as
fear-evoking situations, they frequently vocalized tsik solo calls as well as
tsik-egg calls. These results suggest that marmosets dissociate the vocalization 
of tsik-egg and tsik calls under conditions related to fear/anxiety; tsik-egg
solo vocalizations were emitted under anxiety-related conditions (e.g., isolation
and anxiogenic drug treatment), whereas a mixed vocalization of tsik-egg and tsik
was emitted when confronted with fear-provoking stimuli (i.e., threatening
predatory stimuli). Tsik-egg call with/without tsik can be used as a specific
vocal index of fear/anxiety in marmosets, which allows us to understand the
neural mechanism of negative emotions in primate.

Exploring the innate immunological response of an alternative nonhuman primate
model of infectious disease; the common marmoset.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is increasingly being utilised as a
nonhuman primate model for human disease, ranging from autoimmune to infectious
disease. In order to fully exploit these models, meaningful comparison to the
human host response is necessary. Commercially available reagents, primarily
targeted to human cells, were utilised to assess the phenotype and activation
status of key immune cell types and cytokines in naive and infected animals.
Single cell suspensions of blood, spleen, and lung were examined. Generally, the 
phenotype of cells was comparable between humans and marmosets, with
approximately 63% of all lymphocytes in the blood of marmosets being T cells, 25%
B-cells, and 12% NK cells. The percentage of neutrophils in marmoset blood were
more similar to human values than mouse values. Comparison of the activation
status of cells following experimental systemic or inhalational infection
exhibited different trends in different tissues, most obvious in cell types
active in the innate immune response. This work significantly enhances the
ability to understand the immune response in these animals and fortifies their
use as models of infectious disease.

The treatment of dyskinesia in Parkinson׳s disease remains poor but H3 receptor
agonists have been suggested as a novel pharmacological approach. We examined the
effects of the H3 agonist, immepip, in 6-OHDA-lesioned rats exhibiting AIMs
(abnormal involuntary movements), a rat analogue of dyskinesia, in response to
l-dopa compared to the known anti-dyskinetic agents amantadine, MK-801 and
8-OHDPAT. We then attempted to extend these studies in to dyskinetic
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) treated common marmosets.
Amantadine, MK-801 and 8-OHDPAT all dose-dependently reduced l-dopa-induced
axial, lingual and oral (ALO) AIMs in 6-OHDA-lesioned animals accompanied by a
reduction in contralateral rotation with higher doses of amantadine and MK-801.
By contrast, immepip had no effect on AIMs expression or contralateral rotation. 
In the MPTP-treated common marmoset exhibiting dyskinesia to l-dopa, immepip
alone induced retching and in combination with l-dopa administered subcutaneously
or orally induced the rapid onset of retching and vomiting which was not
controlled by pretreatment with domperidone. Administration of the unrelated H3
agonist, imetit had the same effect. Despite causing negative side-effects, it
appears that both agonists reduced the antiparkinsonian response to l-dopa
resulting in reduced dyskinesia. H3 agonists appear unlikely candidates for the
treatment of dyskinesia in PD based on lack of evidence of efficacy and potential
adverse effects.

The availability of a robust disease model is essential for the development of
countermeasures for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).
While a rhesus macaque model of MERS-CoV has been established, the lack of
uniform, severe disease in this model complicates the analysis of countermeasure 
studies. Modeling of the interaction between the MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein and 
its receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 predicted comparable interaction energies in 
common marmosets and humans. The suitability of the marmoset as a MERS-CoV model 
was tested by inoculation via combined intratracheal, intranasal, oral and ocular
routes. Most of the marmosets developed a progressive severe pneumonia leading to
euthanasia of some animals. Extensive lesions were evident in the lungs of all
animals necropsied at different time points post inoculation. Some animals were
also viremic; high viral loads were detected in the lungs of all infected
animals, and total RNAseq demonstrated the induction of immune and inflammatory
pathways. This is the first description of a severe, partially lethal, disease
model of MERS-CoV, and as such will have a major impact on the ability to assess 
the efficacy of vaccines and treatment strategies as well as allowing more
detailed pathogenesis studies.

The vocal repertoire in common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) has been assumed to
consist not only of vocalizations audible to humans but also of ultrasonic
vocalizations (USVs). The use of USVs to socially indicate distress has not been 
evaluated in this species, however. The authors analyzed the ultrasonic vocal
repertoire of the common marmoset under normal housing conditions, under various 
experimental manipulations intended to elicit positive or negative emotional
responses and during stressful experiences including blood draw and exposure to a
perceived predator. Analysis of the recordings showed that marmosets produced
vocalizations with ultrasonic components as part of their normal vocal
repertoire, but these vocalizations all have audible components as well. Only 4
of the 13 types of vocalizations had ultrasonic components. These ultrasonic
components were not reliably associated with responses to different experimental 
manipulations, suggesting that they are not used to indicate pain, discomfort or 
distress.

OBJECTIVE: Vascular permeability and inflammatory demyelination are intimately
linked in the brain, but what is their temporal relationship? We aimed to
determine the radiological correlates of the earliest tissue changes accompanying
demyelination in a primate model of multiple sclerosis (MS), experimental
autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in the common marmoset.
METHODS: By 7T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), T1 maps, proton density, and
T2-weighted images were acquired before and after EAE induction in 5 marmosets
(every other week before lesions appeared, weekly thereafter). From scans before 
and after intravenous injection of contrast material, we measured the evolution
of lesional blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, comparing in vivo MRI to
postmortem tissue examination.
RESULTS: On average, BBB permeability increased 3.5-fold (p < 0.0001) over the 4 
weeks prior to lesion appearance. Permeability gradually decreased after lesion
appearance, with attendant changes in the distribution of inflammatory cells
(predominantly macrophages and microglia) and demyelination. On tissue analysis, 
we also identified small perivascular foci of microglia and T cells without
blood-derived macrophages or demyelination. These foci had no visible MRI
correlates, although permeability within the foci, but not outside, increased in 
the weeks before the animals died (p < 0.0001).
INTERPRETATION: This study provides compelling evidence that in marmoset EAE,
which forms lesions strongly resembling those of MS, early changes in vascular
permeability are associated with perivascular inflammatory cuffing and
parenchymal microglial activation but precede the arrival of blood-derived
monocytes that accompany demyelination. Prospective detection of transient
permeability changes could afford an opportunity for early intervention to
forestall tissue damage in newly forming lesions.

In the primate cerebral cortex, dendritic spines rapidly increase in number after
birth up to infancy or mid-childhood, and then decrease towards adulthood.
Abnormalities in these processes accompany several psychiatric disorders. In this
study, we examined developmental changes of basal dendrites and spines of layer
III pyramidal cells in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of the common
marmoset. The mPFC consists of several areas with distinct features in layer
organization, histochemistry, connections, and, in humans, vulnerability to
psychiatric disorders. We selected three areas for examination: granular
dorsomedial prefrontal (area 8B/9), dysgranular ventromedial prefrontal (area
14r), and agranular anterior cingulate (area 24) cortices. Dendritic field areas,
lengths, number of branching points, and total spine number reached a peak at 2-3
postnatal months in all three areas. However, the profiles of spine formation and
pruning differed across the three areas with different degrees of granularity;
the amount of spine loss from the peak to adulthood was less in areas 24 (33%)
and 14r (29%) than in area 8B/9 (43%). Disturbance of this modest spine pruning
in the less granular cortical areas may lead to an excessive loss of spines
reported for areas 24 and 14r of schizophrenic patients.

This report is the first description of dosing procedures, pharmacokinetics,
biochemical action, and general tolerability of the antiaging drug rapamycin in
the common marmoset, a small and short-lived monkey. Eudragit-encapsulated
rapamycin was given orally to trained marmosets in a short-term (3 weeks) and a
long-term (14 months) study. Circulating trough rapamycin levels (mean = 5.2
ng/mL; 1.93-10.73 ng/mL) achieved at roughly 1.0 mg/kg/day was comparable to
those reported in studies of rodents and within the therapeutic range for humans.
Long-term treated animals (6/8) indicated a reduction in mammalian target of
rapamycin complex 1 signaling as noted by a decrease in the phospho rpS6 to total
rpS6 ratio after 2 weeks of treatment. All long-term treated subjects had
detectable concentrations of rapamycin in liver (4.7-19.9 pg/mg) and adipose
tissue (2.2-32.8 pg/mg) with reduced mammalian target of rapamycin signaling in
these tissues. There was no evidence of clinical anemia, fibrotic lung changes,
or mouth ulcers. The observed death rate in the long-term study was as expected
given the animals' ages. The ability to rapidly and reliably dose socially housed
marmosets with an oral form of rapamycin that is well tolerated and that
demonstrates a suppression of the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway leads us 
to conclude that this species offers a viable model for rapamycin testing to
establish safety and efficacy for long-term antiaging intervention.

We report the whole-genome sequence of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). 
The 2.26-Gb genome of a female marmoset was assembled using Sanger read data (6×)
and a whole-genome shotgun strategy. A first analysis has permitted comparison
with the genomes of apes and Old World monkeys and the identification of specific
features that might contribute to the unique biology of this diminutive primate, 
including genetic changes that may influence body size, frequent twinning and
chimerism. We observed positive selection in growth hormone/insulin-like growth
factor genes (growth pathways), respiratory complex I genes (metabolic pathways),
and genes encoding immunobiological factors and proteases (reproductive and
immunity pathways). In addition, both protein-coding and microRNA genes related
to reproduction exhibited evidence of rapid sequence evolution. This genome
sequence for a New World monkey enables increased power for comparative analyses 
among available primate genomes and facilitates biomedical research application.

Natural Killer (NK) cells mount a fast and efficient immune response against
tumor cells and are currently a major focus in the development of anti-cancer
cell-based therapies. Due to major differences between the murine and human NK
cell receptor system, a non-human primate model would be helpful to evaluate the 
efficiency of NK-cell based therapies prior to clinical applications. In humans, 
B7-H6 has been shown to facilitate the elimination of lymphoma cells through the 
interaction with its receptor NKp30. The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is 
a new world monkey readily used in biomedical research due to its easy management
and proximity to humans. In this study, we demonstrated the expression of B7-H6
antigen in marmoset B-lymphoblastoid cell lines. In addition, a method was
established to isolate B- or NK-cells from peripheral blood of marmosets with
purities of up to 97%We detected the expression of B7-H6 in lymphoma cells and
for the first time in leukemic blasts of human acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
Marmoset NK cells were shown to lyse marmoset B lymphoblastoid cell line (B-LCL) 
cells by up to 28.4% and human B-LCL cells by up to 20%. This effect was
abrogated when the NK cells were pre-treated with an anti-NKp30 specific
antibody. Also, marmoset NK cells were able to lyse primary leukemic AML cells
and lymphoma cells by up to 8.3 and 20.3%respectively. Stimulation of marmoset NK
cells with recombinant B7-H6 induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and proliferation 
rates. Furthermore, the secretion of IL-1β, IL-8, IFN-γ and TNF-α was
significantly increased upon B7-H6 stimulation. In conclusion, we demonstrated
that non-human primate NK cells have similar mechanisms for the lysis of tumor
cells as human NK cells. Thus, this animal model constitutes a very promising
tool for the development and evaluation of novel NK-cell based therapies.

BACKGROUND: Common marmosets are known to develop an IgM glomerulopathy, which
has been linked with 'wasting marmoset' syndrome. This study investigated renal
pathology in a colony of marmosets, with and without weight loss.
METHODS: Renal histology, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy were
performed on marmosets euthanized for research or for weight loss. Serum and
urine biochemistry were measured during life and at euthanasia.
RESULTS: Histology from 25 adult marmosets (19 research and 6 weight loss) showed
mesangial expansion in the majority of glomeruli. Mesangial changes correlated
with electron-dense deposits and IgM deposition by immunofluorescence; negligible
other pathology was seen. Glomerular basement membrane thickness appeared
increased compared to reported human measurements. Low-grade proteinuria was
present in all animals, but did not progress. Renal function was normal in all
animals.
CONCLUSIONS: Marmosets develop a glomerulopathy characterized by mesangial
expansion, IgM deposition, and proteinuria. This is a benign occurrence and not
specifically associated with weight loss.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a non-human primate that could prove 
useful as human pharmacokinetic and biomedical research models. The cytochromes
P450 (P450s) are a superfamily of enzymes that have critical roles in drug
metabolism and disposition via monooxygenation of a broad range of xenobiotics;
however, information on some marmoset P450s is currently limited. Therefore,
identification and quantitative analysis of tissue-specific mRNA transcripts,
including those of P450s and flavin-containing monooxygenases (FMO, another
monooxygenase family), need to be carried out in detail before the marmoset can
be used as an animal model in drug development. De novo assembly and expression
analysis of marmoset transcripts were conducted with pooled liver, intestine,
kidney, and brain samples from three male and three female marmosets. After
unique sequences were automatically aligned by assembling software, the mean
contig length was 718 bp (with a standard deviation of 457 bp) among a total of
47,883 transcripts. Approximately 30% of the total transcripts were matched to
known marmoset sequences. Gene expression in 18 marmoset P450- and 4 FMO-like
genes displayed some tissue-specific patterns. Of these, the three most highly
expressed in marmoset liver were P450 2D-, 2E-, and 3A-like genes. In
extrahepatic tissues, including brain, gene expressions of these monooxygenases
were lower than those in liver, although P450 3A4 (previously P450 3A21) in
intestine and P450 4A11- and FMO1-like genes in kidney were relatively highly
expressed. By means of massive parallel long-read sequencing and short-read
technology applied to marmoset liver, intestine, kidney, and brain, the combined 
next-generation sequencing analyses reported here were able to identify novel
marmoset drug-metabolizing P450 transcripts that have until now been little
reported. These results provide a foundation for mechanistic studies and pave the
way for the use of marmosets as model animals for drug development in the future.

Interest is rising for animal modeling of pathological gambling. Using the
operant probabilistic-delivery task (PDT), gambling proneness can be evaluated in
laboratory animals. Drawing a comparison with rats, this study evaluated the
common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) using a PDT. By nose- or hand-poking,
subjects learnt to prefer a large (LLL, 5-6 pellets) over a small (SS, 1-2
pellets) reward and, subsequently, the probability of occurrence of large-reward 
delivery was decreased progressively to very low levels (from 100% to 17% and
14%). As probability decreased, subjects showed a great versus little shift in
preference from LLL to SS reinforcer. Hence, two distinct subpopulations
("non-gambler" versus "gambler") were differentiated within each species. A proof
of the model validity comes from marmosets' reaction to reward-delivery omission.
Namely, depending on individual temperament ("gambler" versus "non-gambler"),
they showed either persistence (i.e., inadequate pokes towards LLL) or
restlessness (i.e., inadequate pokes towards SS), respectively. In conclusion,
the marmoset could be a suitable model for preclinical gambling studies.
Implementation of the PDT to species other than rats may be relevant for
determining its external validity/generalizability and improving its
face/construct validity.

Small RNAs mediate gene silencing by binding Argonaute/Piwi proteins to regulate 
target RNAs. Here, we describe small RNA profiling of the adult testes of
Callithrix jacchus, the common marmoset. The most abundant class of small RNAs in
the adult testis was piRNAs, although 353 novel miRNAs but few endo-siRNAs were
also identified. MARWI, a marmoset homolog of mouse MIWI and a very abundant PIWI
in adult testes, associates with piRNAs that show characteristics of mouse
pachytene piRNAs. As in other mammals, most marmoset piRNAs are derived from
conserved clustered regions in the genome, which are annotated as intergenic
regions. However, unlike in mice, marmoset piRNA clusters are also found on the X
chromosome, suggesting escape from meiotic sex chromosome inactivation by the
X-linked clusters. Some of the piRNA clusters identified contain
antisense-orientated pseudogenes, suggesting the possibility that
pseudogene-derived piRNAs may regulate parental functional protein-coding genes. 
More piRNAs map to transposable element (TE) subfamilies when they have copies in
piRNA clusters. In addition, the strand bias observed for piRNAs mapped to each
TE subfamily correlates with the polarity of copies inserted in clusters. These
findings suggest that pachytene piRNA clusters determine the abundance and
strand-bias of TE-derived piRNAs, may regulate protein-coding genes via
pseudogene-derived piRNAs, and may even play roles in meiosis in the adult
marmoset testis.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is considered the hepatic manifestation 
of metabolic syndrome. The more clinically concerning form of the disease,
nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), is characterized by steatosis, lobular
inflammation, and ballooning degeneration. Here we describe a naturally occurring
syndrome in the common marmoset that recapitulates the pathologic findings
associated with NAFLD/NASH in humans. Hepatomegaly determined to result from
NAFLD was observed in 33 of 183 marmosets. A comprehensive histopathologic
assessment performed in 31 marmosets demonstrated that NAFLD was characterized by
variably sized, Oil Red O staining cytoplasmic vacuoles and observed primarily in
animals with evidence of obesity and insulin resistance. A subset of marmosets
(16 of 31) also demonstrated evidence of NASH characterized by multifocal
inflammation combined with ballooning hepatocellular degeneration. Marmosets with
NASH demonstrated an increase in immunostaining with an antibody targeted against
the human leukocyte antigens (HLA)-DP, HLA-DQ, and HLA-DR compared with marmosets
without NASH (38.89 cells/10× field vs 12.05 cells/10× field, P = .05). In
addition, marmosets with NASH demonstrated increased Ki-67 immunopositive
cellular proliferation compared with those without (5.95 cells/10× field vs 1.53 
cells/10× field, P = .0002). Finally, animals with NASH demonstrated
significantly increased mean circulating serum iron levels (160.47 μg/dl, P =
.008) and an increase in numbers of Prussian blue-positive Kupffer cells (9.28
cells/40× field, P = .005) relative to marmosets without NASH (97.75 μg/dl and
1.87 cells/40×, respectively). This study further characterizes the
histopathology of NAFLD/NASH and suggests that the marmoset may be a valuable
animal model with which to investigate the host and environmental factors
contributing to the progression of NAFLD/ NASH.

Experimental studies on traditions in animals have focused almost entirely on the
initial transmission phase in captive populations. We conducted an open diffusion
field experiment with 13 groups of wild common marmosets, Callithrix jacchus.
Seven groups contained individuals that were already familiar with the task
('push or pull' box) and thus served as potential models for naïve individuals.
Additionally, in four groups one individual was trained for one of the two
possible techniques and in two control groups no skilled individuals were
present. First, we investigated whether experienced individuals would remember
how to solve the task even after 2 years without exposure and whether they would 
still prefer their learned technique. Second, we tested whether naïve individuals
would learn socially from their skilled family members and, more importantly,
whether they would use the same technique. Third, we conducted several test
blocks to see whether the individual and/or group behaviour would persist over
time. Our results show that wild common marmosets were able to memorize, learn
socially and maintain preferences of foraging techniques. This field experiment
thus reveals a promising approach to studying social learning in the wild and
provides the basis for long-term studies on tradition formation.

Understanding the role of serotonin (or 5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) in aversive
processing has been hampered by the contradictory findings, across studies, of
increased sensitivity to punishment in terms of subsequent response choice but
decreased sensitivity to punishment-induced response suppression following gross 
depletion of central 5-HT. To address this apparent discrepancy, the present
study determined whether both effects could be found in the same animals by
performing localized 5-HT depletions in the amygdala or orbitofrontal cortex
(OFC) of a New World monkey, the common marmoset. 5-HT depletion in the amygdala 
impaired response choice on a probabilistic visual discrimination task by
increasing the effectiveness of misleading, or false, punishment and reward, and 
decreased response suppression in a variable interval test of punishment
sensitivity that employed the same reward and punisher. 5-HT depletion in the OFC
also disrupted probabilistic discrimination learning and decreased response
suppression. Computational modeling of behavior on the discrimination task showed
that the lesions reduced reinforcement sensitivity. A novel, unitary account of
the findings in terms of the causal role of 5-HT in the anticipation of both
negative and positive motivational outcomes is proposed and discussed in relation
to current theories of 5-HT function and our understanding of mood and anxiety
disorders.

BACKGROUND: The impact of the intrauterine environment on the developmental
programming of adult female reproductive success is still poorly understood and
potentially underestimated. Litter size variation in a nonhuman primate, the
common marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus), allows us to model the effects of
varying intrauterine environments (e.g. nutrient restriction, exposure to male
womb-mates) on the risk of losing fetuses in adulthood. Our previous work has
characterized the fetuses of triplet pregnancies as experiencing intrauterine
nutritional restriction.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used over a decade of demographic data from
the Southwest National Primate Research Center common marmoset colony. We
evaluated differences between twin and triplet females in the number of
pregnancies they produce and the proportion of those pregnancies that ended in
fetal loss. We found that triplet females produced the same number of total
offspring as twin females, but lost offspring during pregnancy at a significantly
higher rate than did twins (38% vs. 13%, p = 0.02). Regardless of their own birth
weight or the sex ratio of the litter the experienced as fetuses, triplet females
lost more fetuses than did twins. Females with a male littermate experienced a
significant increase in the proportion of stillbirths.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These striking findings anchor pregnancy loss in the
mother's own fetal environment and development, underscoring a "Womb to Womb"
view of the lifecourse and the intergenerational consequences of development.
This has important translational implications for understanding the large
proportion of human stillbirths that are unexplained. Our findings provide strong
evidence that a full understanding of mammalian life history and reproductive
biology requires a developmental foundation.

Six Gram-positive-staining, microaerophilic, non-spore-forming,
fructose-6-phosphate phosphoketolase-positive bacterial strains with a peculiar
morphology were isolated from faecal samples of baby common marmosets (Callithrix
jacchus). Cells of these strains showed a morphology not reported previously for 
a bifidobacterial species, which resembled a coiled snake, always coiled or ring 
shaped or forming a 'Y' shape. Strains MRM 3/1(T) and MRM 4/2 were chosen as
representative strains and characterized further. The bacteria utilized a wide
range of carbohydrates and produced urease. Glucose was fermented to acetate and 
lactate. Strain MRM 3/1(T) showed a peptidoglycan type unique among members of
the genus Bifidobacterium. The DNA base composition was 64.7 mol% G+C.
Almost-complete 16S rRNA, hsp60, clpC and rpoB gene sequences were obtained and
phylogenetic relationships were determined. Comparative analysis of 16S rRNA gene
sequences showed that strains MRM 3/1(T) and MRM 4/2 had the highest similarities
to Bifidobacterium scardovii DSM 13734(T) (94.6%) and Bifidobacterium
stellenboschense DSM 23968(T) (94.5%). Analysis of hsp60 showed that both strains
were closely related to B. stellenboschense DSM 23968(T) (97.5% similarity);
however, despite this high degree of similarity, our isolates could be
distinguished from B. stellenboschense DSM 23968(T) by low levels of DNA-DNA
relatedness (30.4% with MRM 3/1(T)). Strains MRM 3/1(T) and MRM 4/2 were located 
in an actinobacterial cluster and were more closely related to the genus
Bifidobacterium than to other genera in the family Bifidobacteriaceae. On the
basis of these results, strains MRM 3/1(T) and MRM 4/2 represent a novel species 
within the genus Bifidobacterium, for which the name Bifidobacterium aesculapii
sp. nov. is proposed; the type strain is MRM 3/1(T) ( = DSM 26737(T) = JCM
18761(T)).

The natural killer group 2 membrane D (NKG2D) receptor is an NK-activating
receptor that plays an important role in host defense against tumors and viral
infections. Although the marmoset is an important and reliable animal model,
especially for the study of human-specific viral infections, functional
characterization of NKG2D on marmoset NK cells has not previously been conducted.
In the present study, we investigated a subpopulation of marmoset NK cells that
express NKG2D and exhibit cytolytic potential. On the basis of their CD16 and
CD56 expression patterns, marmoset NK cells can be classified into three
subpopulations: CD16(+) CD56(-), CD16(-) CD56(+) and CD16(-) CD56(-) cells. NKG2D
expression on marmoset CD16(+) CD56(-) and CD16(-) CD56(+) splenocytes was
confirmed using an NKG2D ligand composed of an MHC class I chain-related molecule
A (MICA)-Fc fusion protein. When marmoset splenocytes were cultured with IL-2 for
4 days, NKG2D expression was retained on CD16(+) CD56(-) and CD16(-) CD56(+). In 
addition, CD16(+) CD56(+) cells within the marmoset NK population appeared which 
expressed NKG2D after IL-2 stimulation. IL-2-activated marmoset NK cells showed
strong cytolytic activity against K562 target cells and target cells stably
expressing MICA. Further, the cytolytic activity of marmoset splenocytes was
significantly reduced after addition of MICA-Fc fusion protein. Thus, NKG2D
functions as an activating receptor on marmoset NK cells that possesses cytotoxic
potential, and phenotypic profiles of marmoset NK cell subpopulations are similar
to those seen in humans.

Oogonia are characterized by diploidy and mitotic proliferation. Human and mouse 
oogonia express several factors such as OCT4, which are characteristic of
pluripotent cells. In human, almost all oogonia enter meiosis between weeks 9 and
22 of prenatal development or undergo mitotic arrest and subsequent elimination
from the ovary. As a consequence, neonatal human ovaries generally lack oogonia. 
The same was found in neonatal ovaries of the rhesus monkey, a representative of 
the old world monkeys (Catarrhini). By contrast, proliferating oogonia were found
in adult prosimians (now called Strepsirrhini), which is a group of 'lower'
primates. The common marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus) belongs to the new
world monkeys (Platyrrhini) and is increasingly used in reproductive biology and 
stem cell research. However, ovarian development in the marmoset monkey has not
been widely investigated. Herein, we show that the neonatal marmoset ovary has an
extremely immature histological appearance compared with the human ovary. It
contains numerous oogonia expressing the pluripotency factors OCT4A, SALL4, and
LIN28A (LIN28). The pluripotency factor-positive germ cells also express the
proliferation marker MKI67 (Ki-67), which has previously been shown in the human 
ovary to be restricted to premeiotic germ cells. Together, the data demonstrate
the primitiveness of the neonatal marmoset ovary compared with human. This study 
may introduce the marmoset monkey as a non-human primate model to experimentally 
study the aspects of primate primitive gonad development, follicle assembly, and 
germ cell biology in vivo.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is widely used in biomedical research,
with many housed for breeding purposes world-wide. Significant variation in
reproductive output among females has been found compared to other anthropoid
primates. The present study explores this reproductive variation, focusing on
potential predictors of dam longevity and litter size, as well as changes over
time. Back-record analysis was conducted, yielding litter information and
reproductive summaries of 360 dams housed at three UK marmoset colonies over four
decades (1970s-2000s). Results revealed differences among the colonies, as well
as within colonies over decades, suggesting environment may play an important
role. Cox proportional hazards regression analyses revealed significant effects
of mean litter size and yearly production on dam longevity. Decade, mean
inter-birth interval and mean dam weight were found to be significant factors
explaining dam longevity when looking at colonies individually. The most commonly
recorded cause of death was "poor condition." Linear regression models found that
no reproductive variable was useful in explaining mean litter size, except dam
weight at conception, data which was only consistently recorded at one colony.
While triplets were common at all three colonies, these larger litters were
consistently associated with higher infant mortality, despite human intervention 
to improve survival. This study increases our understanding of marmoset
reproduction, and possible improvements to practical aspects of colony management
to enhance survival and welfare are discussed.

High trait anxiety is a risk factor for the development of anxiety disorders.
Like the disorders themselves high trait anxiety has marked phenotypic variation 
at the level of symptomatology and neural circuits, suggesting that there may be 
different symptoms and distinct neural circuits associated with risk for these
disorders. To address these issues, it is essential to develop reliable animal
models of trait anxiety in a non-human primate whose brain bears structural and
functional similarity to humans. The present study investigated individual
variation in responsivity to fearful and anxiety provoking stimuli in the common 
marmoset monkey. Seven out of 27 animals failed to display discriminative,
conditioned cardiovascular and behavioral responses on an auditory fear
discrimination task, similar to that seen in high anxious humans and rodents.
Their heightened emotionality to a rubber snake was consistent with the
hypothesis that they were high in trait-like anxiety. Evidence for phenotypic
variation in the high anxiety group was provided by the finding that
discrimination failure was predicted early in conditioning by either
hyper-vigilant scanning to the cues or a reduction in blood pressure to the
context, i.e., test apparatus. Given that high trait anxiety in humans can be
associated with altered prefrontal cognitive functioning and previously we
implicated the marmoset anterior orbitofrontal (antOFC) and ventrolateral
prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) in negative emotion regulation, we also tested the
marmosets on two tests of cognitive flexibility differentially dependent on these
two regions. While the high anxious group did not differ overall in their
perseverative performance, the two distinct phenotypes were differentially
correlated with reduced perseverative responding on the OFC- and vlPFC-dependent 
flexibility tests. Together, this study provides a new model of trait anxiety in 
marmosets amenable to analysis of phenotypic variation and neural circuitry.

Language is a characteristic feature of human communication. Several familial
language impairments have been identified, and candidate genes for language
impairments already isolated. Studies comparing expression patterns of these
genes in human brain are necessary to further understanding of these genes.
However, it is difficult to examine gene expression in human brain. In this
study, we used a non-human primate (common marmoset; Callithrix jacchus) as a
biological model of the human brain to investigate expression patterns of human
speech- and reading-related genes. Expression patterns of speech disorder-
(FoxP2, FoxP1, CNTNAP2, and CMIP) and dyslexia- (ROBO1, DCDC2, and KIAA0319)
related genes were analyzed. We found the genes displayed overlapping expression 
patterns in the ocular, auditory, and motor systems. Our results enhance
understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying language impairments.

Adaptation of the horizontal vestibulo-ocular reflex (HVOR) provides an
experimental model for cerebellum-dependent motor learning. We developed an eye
movement measuring system and a paradigm for induction of HVOR adaptation for the
common marmoset. The HVOR gain in dark measured by 10° (peak-to-peak amplitude)
and 0.11-0.5Hz turntable oscillation was around unity. The gain-up and gain-down 
HVOR adaptation was induced by 1h of sustained out-of-phase and in-phase
10°-0.33Hz combined turntable-screen oscillation in the light, respectively. To
examine the role of long-term depression (LTD) of parallel fiber-Purkinje cell
synapses, we intraperitonially applied T-588 or nimesulide, which block the
induction of LTD in vitro or in vivo preparations, 1h before the test of HVOR
adaptation. T-588 (3 and 5mg/kg body weight) did not affect nonadapted HVOR
gains, and impaired both gain-up and gain-down HVOR adaptation. Nimesulide (3 and
6mg/kg) did not affect nonadapted HVOR gains, and impaired gain-up HVOR
adaptation dose-dependently; however, it very little affected gain-down HVOR
adaptation. These findings are consistent with the results of our study of
nimesulide on the adaptation of horizontal optokinetic response in mice (Le et
al., 2010), and support the view that LTD underlies HVOR adaptation.

Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), an important method used to treat male
subfertility, is applied in the transgenic technology of sperm-mediated gene
transfer. However, no study has described successful generation of offspring
using ICSI in the common marmoset, a small non-human primate used as a model for 
biomedical translational research. In this study, we investigated blastocyst
development and the subsequent live offspring stages of marmoset oocytes matured 
in vitro and fertilized by ICSI. To investigate the optimal timing of performing 
ICSI, corrected immature oocytes were matured in vitro and ICSI was performed at 
various time points (1-2 h, 2-4 h, 4-6 h, 6-8 h, and 8-10 h after extrusion of
the first polar body (PB)). Matured oocytes were then divided randomly into two
groups: one was used for in vitro fertilization (IVF) and the other for ICSI. To 
investigate in vivo development of embryos followed by ICSI, 6-cell- to
8-cell-stage embryos and blastocysts were nonsurgically transferred into
recipient marmosets. Although no significant differences were observed in the
fertilization rate of blastocysts among ICSI timing after the first PB extrusion,
the blastocyst rate at 1-2 h was lowest among groups at 2-4 h, 4-6 h, 6-8 h, and 
8-10 h. Comparing ICSI to IVF, the fertilization rates obtained in ICSI were
higher than in IVF (p>0.05). No significant difference was noted in the cleaved
blastocyst rate between ICSI and IVF. Following the transfer of 37 ICSI
blastocysts, 4 of 20 recipients became pregnant, while with the transfer of 21
6-cell- to 8-cell-stage ICSI embryos, 3 of 8 recipients became pregnant. Four
healthy offspring were produced and grew normally. These are the first marmoset
offspring produced by ICSI, making it an effective fertilization method for
marmosets.

BACKGROUND: The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a New World primate
sharing many similarities with humans. Recently developed technology for
generating transgenic marmosets has opened new avenues for faithful
recapitulation of human diseases, which could not be achieved in rodent models.
However, the longer lifespan of common marmosets compared with rodents may result
in an extended period for in vivo analysis of common marmoset disease models.
Therefore, establishing rapid and efficient techniques for obtaining neuronal
cells from transgenic individuals that enable in vitro analysis of molecular
mechanisms underlying diseases are required. Recently, several groups have
reported on methods, termed direct reprogramming, to generate neuronal cells by
defined factors from somatic cells of various kinds of species, including mouse
and human. The aim of the present study was to determine whether direct
reprogramming technology was applicable to common marmosets.
RESULTS: Common marmoset induced neuronal (cjiN) cells with neuronal morphology
were generated from common marmoset embryonic skin fibroblasts (cjF) by
overexpressing the neuronal transcription factors: ASCL1, BRN2, MYT1L and
NEUROD1. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction of cjiN cells showed
upregulation of neuronal genes highly related to neuronal differentiation and
function. The presence of neuronal marker proteins was also confirmed by
immunocytochemistry. Electrical field stimulation to cjiN cells increased the
intracellular calcium level, which was reversibly blocked by the voltage-gated
sodium channel blocker, tetrodotoxin, indicating that these cells were
functional. The neuronal function of these cells was further confirmed by
electrophysiological analyses showing that action potentials could be elicited by
membrane depolarization in current-clamp mode while both fast-activating and
inactivating sodium currents and outward currents were observed in voltage-clamp 
mode. The 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation assay showed that cjiN cells
were directly converted from cjFs without passing a proliferative state.
CONCLUSIONS: Functional common marmoset neuronal cells can be obtained directly
from embryonic fibroblasts by overexpressing four neuronal transcription factors 
under in vitro conditions. Overall, direct conversion technology on marmoset
somatic cells provides the opportunity to analyze and screen phenotypes of
genetically-modified common marmosets.

BACKGROUND: The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is of interest for
reproductive studies because of their high and variable fertility in captivity.
However, to understand this variability, much basic information still needs to be
gathered. This study is the first to characterize marmoset semen comparing a
German and a Brazilian colony.
METHODS: All animals were weighted, and semen samples were collected by penile
vibratory stimulation and analyzed according to standard criteria.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The German animals had a higher mean and maximum weight 
than the Brazilian. Further, sperm concentration tended to be higher with heavier
animals in the German population, but not in the Brazilian. Additionally, major
defects tended to be more frequent with higher weight but also only in German
sample. In spite of these differences, the total range and variability in sperm
concentration were similar in both populations, suggesting that this is
characteristic for the species.

Common marmoset (CM) is widely recognized as a useful non-human primate for
disease modeling and preclinical studies. Thus, embryonic stem cells (ESCs)
derived from CM have potential as an appropriate cell source to test human
regenerative medicine using human ESCs. CM ESCs have been established by us and
other groups, and can be cultured in vitro. However, the growth factors and
downstream pathways for self-renewal of CM ESCs are largely unknown. In this
study, we found that basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) rather than leukemia
inhibitory factor (LIF) promoted CM ESC self-renewal via the activation of
phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)-protein kinase B (AKT) pathway on mouse
embryonic fibroblast (MEF) feeders. Moreover, bFGF and transforming growth factor
β (TGFβ) signaling pathways cooperatively maintained the undifferentiated state
of CM ESCs under feeder-free condition. Our findings may improve the culture
techniques of CM ESCs and facilitate their use as a preclinical experimental
resource for human regenerative medicine.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) has attracted extensive attention for
use as a non-human primate model in biomedical research, especially in the study 
of neuropsychiatric disorders. However, behavioral test methods are still limited
in the field of marmoset research. The light-dark box is widely used for the
evaluation of anxiety in rodents, but little is known about light-dark preference
in marmosets. Here, we modified the light-dark test to study this behavior. The
modified apparatus consisted of three compartments: one transparent open area and
two closed opaque compartments. The closed compartments could be dark or light.
We found that both adult and young marmosets liked to explore the open area, but 
the young animals showed more interest than adults. Furthermore, when one of the 
closed compartments was light and the other dark, the adult marmosets showed a
preference for the dark compartment, but the young animals had no preference.
These results suggest that the exploratory behavior and the light-dark preference
in marmosets are age-dependent. Our study provides a new method to study
exploration, anxiety, and fear in marmosets.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) provides many advantages over
traditional rodent and macaque species as a model for human ageing and may be
very useful for studying the effects of sex steroids on cognitive and brain
ageing. We present the first study examining the effects of oestrogens on
cognitive function in female marmosets. Adult monkeys (3-5 years of age) were
trained to a specific learning criterion on a battery of cognitive tasks
preoperatively (object discrimination, delayed response with increasing delays
and detour reaching with opaque box) and were tested on different versions of
these tasks (object reversals, delayed response with randomised delays and detour
reaching with clear box) after ovariectomy and simultaneous implantation with
17β-oestradiol (E2 ) (n = 6) or blank (n = 6) Silastic capsules. Acquisition of a
delayed matching-to-position task with a 1-s delay was also administered after
completion of these tests. E2 -treated monkeys were significantly impaired on the
second reversal and showed an increase in perseverative responding from reversals
1-3. Their performance also tended to be worse than that of control monkeys on
the delayed response task. Performance acquisition on the delayed
matching-to-position tended to be better in E2 -treated relative to control
monkeys, although the group difference did not reach statistical significance. No
effect of treatment was detected for detour reaching or affiliative behaviours.
Overall, the findings indicate that E2 compromises performance on
prefrontally-mediated tasks. The suggestion that E2 may improve acquisition on
tasks dependent on the hippocampus will require further validation. These results
are discussed in the context of dopaminergic and serotonergic signalling. We
conclude that the marmoset is a useful new primate model for examining the
effects of oestrogens on cognitive function.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a New World monkey that is used
frequently as a model for various human diseases. However, detailed knowledge
about the MHC is still lacking. In this study, we sequenced and annotated a total
of 854 kb of the common marmoset MHC region that corresponds to the HLA-A/G/F
segment (Caja-G/F) between the Caja-G1 and RNF39 genes. The sequenced region
contains 19 MHC class I genes, of which 14 are of the MHC-G (Caja-G) type, and 5 
are of the MHC-F (Caja-F) type. Six putatively functional Caja-G and Caja-F genes
(Caja-G1, Caja-G3, Caja-G7, Caja-G12, Caja-G13, and Caja-F4), 13 pseudogenes
related either to Caja-G or Caja-F, three non-MHC genes (ZNRD1, PPPIR11, and
RNF39), two miscRNA genes (ZNRD1-AS1 and HCG8), and one non-MHC pseudogene
(ETF1P1) were identified. Phylogenetic analysis suggests segmental duplications
of units consisting of basically five (four Caja-G and one Caja-F) MHC class I
genes, with subsequent expansion/deletion of genes. A similar genomic
organization of the Caja-G/F segment has not been observed in catarrhine
primates, indicating that this genomic segment was formed in New World monkeys
after the split of New World and Old World monkeys.

The Callithrix jacchus is a Brazilian endemic species that has been widely used
as an experimental model in biomedical research. Anatomical data are necessary to
support experimental studies with this species. Eleven hearts of C. jacchus from 
the German Primate Centre (DPZ) have been studied in order to characterize their 
gross morphometry and compare them with other animal models and human. Biometric 
data were also obtained. The mean values for morphometry of the hearts did not
show any significant difference between male and female. The relative heart
weight was similar to human, bovine and equine species. Considering those
aspects, the C. jacchus could be used as non-human primate experimental model for
biomedical studies on heart.

Compassionate caretaking behaviour towards dying adult group members has been
reported as being unique to humans and chimpanzees. Here we describe in detail
the reaction of a wild dominant male common marmoset, a neotropical primate, to
the accidental death of the dominant female of its group. The male exhibited
behaviours towards the dying female that resembled those of chimpanzees and
humans. The long-term relationship between the dominant pair (which lasted at
least 3.5 years) and their social status in the group may have contributed to the
male's behavioural response. The male prevented young individuals from
approaching the dying female, behaviour previously observed in chimpanzees. The
data provide an interesting insight into compassionate caretaking behaviours in
New World primates as well as the pair-bond systems of common marmosets. These
are rare observations, and thus their detailed descriptions are essential if we
are to create a comparative and enhanced understanding of human and nonhuman
primate thanatology.

Recent generation of induced pluripotent stem (iPSCs) has made a significant
impact on the field of human regenerative medicine. Prior to the clinical
application of iPSCs, testing of their safety and usefulness must be carried out 
using reliable animal models of various diseases. In order to generate iPSCs from
common marmoset (CM; Callithrix jacchus), one of the most useful experimental
animals, we have lentivirally transduced reprogramming factors, including POU5F1 
(also known as OCT3/4), SOX2, KLF4, and c-MYC into CM fibroblasts. The cells
formed round colonies expressing embryonic stem cell markers, however, they
showed an abnormal karyotype denoted as 46, X, del(4q), +mar, and formed human
dysgerminoma-like tumors in SCID mice, indicating that the transduction of
reprogramming factors caused unexpected tumorigenesis of CM cells. Moreover, CM
dysgerminoma-like tumors were highly sensitive to DNA-damaging agents,
irradiation, and fibroblast growth factor receptor inhibitor, and their growth
was dependent on c-MYC expression. These results indicate that DNA-damaging
agents, irradiation, fibroblast growth factor receptor inhibitor, and
c-MYC-targeted therapies might represent effective treatment strategies for
unexpected tumors in patients receiving iPSC-based therapy.

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) could be useful for regenerative medicine because
they can beharvested easily from the bone marrow of living donors and the cells
can be differentiated into adipogenic, osteogenic, and chondrogenic lineages in
vitro. To apply MSCs for the medical treatment of human diseases as regenerative 
medicine, detailed experimental characterization of the cells is required.
Recently, a New World primate, the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), has been
widely used as a new human disease model because of its ease of handling and
breeding. Although common marmoset MSCs have been established and will be used in
preclinical studies of regenerative medicine, the characteristics of these cells 
remain unclear. Aiming to characterize common marmoset MSCs further, we harvested
common marmoset bone marrow-derived cells (cmBMDCs) from the femurs of newborn
males. We revealed that the morphology of the cells was similar to common
marmoset fibroblasts, and extracellular matrix components, such as gelatin and
fibronectin, were effective for their proliferation and formation of
colony-forming unit fibroblasts. Furthermore, we were able to differentiate
cmBMDCs into adipocytes, osteocytes, and chondrocytes in vitro, and they
expressed the MSCmarkers CD44, CD73, CD90, and CD105, but their expression
decreased with increasing passage number. The data demonstrate that cmBMDCs
exhibit characteristics of MSCs and thus it would be beneficial to use these
cells in preclinical studies.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a small-bodied New World primate,
offers several advantages to complement vision research in larger primates.
Studies in the anesthetized marmoset have detailed the anatomy and physiology of 
their visual system (Rosa et al., 2009) while studies of auditory and vocal
processing have established their utility for awake and behaving
neurophysiological investigations (Lu et al., 2001a,b; Eliades and Wang, 2008a,b;
Osmanski and Wang, 2011; Remington et al., 2012). However, a critical unknown is 
whether marmosets can perform visual tasks under head restraint. This has been
essential for studies in macaques, enabling both accurate eye tracking and head
stabilization for neurophysiology. In one set of experiments we compared the free
viewing behavior of head-fixed marmosets to that of macaques, and found that
their saccadic behavior is comparable across a number of saccade metrics and that
saccades target similar regions of interest including faces. In a second set of
experiments we applied behavioral conditioning techniques to determine whether
the marmoset could control fixation for liquid reward. Two marmosets could fixate
a central point and ignore peripheral flashing stimuli, as needed for receptive
field mapping. Both marmosets also performed an orientation discrimination task, 
exhibiting a saturating psychometric function with reliable performance and
shorter reaction times for easier discriminations. These data suggest that the
marmoset is a viable model for studies of active vision and its underlying neural
mechanisms.

L-3,4-Dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) is the most effective treatment for
Parkinson's disease (PD), but its long-term administration is complicated by
wearing-off and dyskinesia. UWA-101, a dual, equipotent inhibitor of dopamine
(DAT) and serotonin (SERT) transporters, has previously been shown to
successfully extend duration of anti-parkinsonian benefit of L-DOPA (ON-time),
without exacerbating dyskinesia, in the
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-lesioned marmoset. However,
UWA-101 is racemic and it is unclear whether one or both enantiomers contribute
to its actions, and whether a better therapeutic effect might be attained by
using a single antipode. In the current study, we synthesised the two enantiomers
of UWA-101, R-101 (UWA-121) and S-101 (UWA-122), characterised their
pharmacological profiles and administered them to MPTP-lesioned marmosets.
Parkinsonism, dyskinesia, psychosis-like behaviours and duration of ON-time were 
evaluated. UWA-121 is a dual DAT > SERT inhibitor, with an approximate 10:1
DAT:SERT affinity ratio (inhibitory constants (Ki) of 307 and 3830 nM,
respectively). In combination with L-DOPA, UWA-121 extended duration of ON-time
when compared to L-DOPA/vehicle treatment (by 40%, P < 0.01). UWA-121 also
extended duration of ON-time without dyskinesia (by 215%, P < 0.05) and ON-time
without psychosis-like behaviours when compared to L-DOPA/vehicle treatment (by
345%, P < 0.01). UWA-121 did not worsen the severity of dyskinesia or
psychosis-like behaviours (P > 0.05). UWA-122 is a selective SERT inhibitor (Ki
120 nM, Ki at DAT > 50 μM) and, in combination with L-DOPA, had no effect on
ON-time, dyskinesia or psychosis-like behaviours (P > 0.05). These data indicate 
that dual DAT and SERT inhibitors effectively enhance L-DOPA anti-parkinsonian
action without worsening dyskinesia and that compounds with such a
pharmacological profile represent promising agents against wearing-off in PD.

This is the second report of a series paper, which reports molecular mechanisms
underlying the occurrence of pruning spine phase after rapid spinogenesis phase
in neonates and young infant in the primate brain. We performed microarray
analysis between the peak of spine numbers [postnatal 3 months (M)] and spine
pruning (postnatal 6M) in prefrontal, inferior temporal, and primary visual
cortices of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). The pruning phase is not
clearly defined in rodents but is in primates including the marmoset. The
differentially expressed genes between 3M and 6M in all three cortical areas were
selected by two-way analysis of variance. The list of selected genes was analyzed
by canonical pathway analysis using "Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of complex omics 
data" (IPA; Ingenuity Systems, Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). In this report, we
discuss these lists of genes for the glutamate receptor system, G-protein-coupled
neuromodulator system, protector of normal tissue and mitochondria, and reelin.
(1) Glutamate is a common neurotransmitter. Its receptors AMPA1, GRIK1, and their
scaffold protein DLG4 decreased as spine numbers decreased. Instead, GRIN3 (NMDA 
receptor) increased, suggesting that strong NMDA excitatory currents may be
required for a single neuron to receive sufficient net synaptic activity in order
to compensate for the decrease in synapse. (2) Most of the G protein-coupled
receptor genes (e.g., ADRA1D, HTR2A, HTR4, and DRD1) in the selected list were
upregulated at 6M. The downstream gene ROCK2 in these receptor systems plays a
role of decreasing synapses, and ROCK2 decreased at 6M. (3) Synaptic phagosytosis
by microglia with complement and other cytokines could cause damage to normal
tissue and mitochondria. SOD1, XIAP, CD46, and CD55, which play protective roles 
in normal tissue and mitochondria, showed higher expression at 6M than at 3M,
suggesting that normal brain tissue is more protected at 6M. (4) Reelin has an
important role in cortical layer formation. In addition, RELN and three different
pathways of reelin were expressed at 6M, suggesting that new synapse formation
decreased at that age. Moreover, if new synapses were formed, their positions
were free and probably dependent on activity.

Here we present the results of a demographic analysis of 25 y (1985 to 2010) of
common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) and cotton-top tamarin (Saguinus oedipus)
records from the New England Primate Research Center. Summaries of longevity and 
survivorship are analyzed by birth-type category (including singletons, twins,
triplets, and quadruplets) and sex. In addition, a brief evolutionary review is
presented. Surrogates of hematopoietic chimerism, twinning, and reproductive
output are explored in a large number of animals to help decipher the potential
effects of chimerism on life history in marmosets and tamarins. In addition to
exploring chimerism through demographic data, multiple-birth frequency and
survivorship are compared between species. New World primates can make ideal
translational models for disease and behavioral research across multiple
disciplines. A better understanding of their reproductive success and
survivorship in captivity helps develop these nonhuman primate models, their role
in aging research, and understanding of their behavioral ecology. This mission is
likely to only increase in its importance to biomedical research due to both the 
sequencing of the marmoset genome and the growing demand for alternatives to Old 
World primate models.

Opn5 is one of the recently identified opsin groups that is responsible for
nonvisual photoreception in animals. We previously showed that a chicken homolog 
of mammalian Opn5 (Opn5m) is a Gi-coupled UV sensor having molecular properties
typical of bistable pigments. Here we demonstrated that mammalian Opn5m evolved
to be a more specialized photosensor by losing one of the characteristics of
bistable pigments, direct binding of all-trans-retinal. We first confirmed that
Opn5m proteins in zebrafish, Xenopus tropicalis, mouse, and human are also
UV-sensitive pigments. Then we found that only mammalian Opn5m proteins lack the 
ability to directly bind all-trans-retinal. Mutational analysis showed that these
characteristics were acquired by a single amino acid replacement at position 168.
By comparing the expression patterns of Opn5m between mammals and chicken, we
found that, like chicken Opn5m, mammalian Opn5m was localized in the ganglion
cell layer and inner nuclear layer of the retina. However, the mouse and primate 
(common marmoset) opsins were distributed not in the posterior hypothalamus
(including the region along the third ventricle) where chicken Opn5m is
localized, but in the preoptic hypothalamus. Interestingly, RPE65, an essential
enzyme for forming 11-cis-retinal in the visual cycle is expressed near the
preoptic hypothalamus of the mouse and common marmoset brain but not near the
region of the chicken brain where chicken Opn5m is expressed. Therefore,
mammalian Opn5m may work exclusively as a short wavelength sensor in the brain as
well as in the retina with the assistance of an 11-cis-retinal-supplying system.

Motor development has been extensively studied in human infants and children,
with several established scales for the evaluation of motor functions. However,
the study of the neuronal mechanisms underlying human motor development is
hampered by the lack of good animal models. The common marmoset (Callithrix
jacchus), a small New World monkey, has recently attracted much attention as a
potential nonhuman primate model for understanding human physiology and diseases.
However, little is known about its gross motor development. In the present study,
we found that marmosets have a critical period for motor development in postnatal
weeks 2 to 5, and acquire most of their motor skills by 8 weeks of age. We also
developed methods to assess their motor functions, which will be useful for the
evaluation of motor performance in marmoset models of human diseases. In
addition, we found that marmosets exhibit a "head-to-tail" sequence of motor
development similar to that found in humans, further supporting the notion that
they provide a good animal model for studying the neuronal mechanisms underlying 
human motor development.

Parental care in mammals is influenced by sensory stimuli from infants, such as
sight and sound, and by changes in the hormone levels of caretakers. To determine
the responsiveness of common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) adult males with and
without previous experience in caretaking to newborn sensory cues, we exposed
twelve males to infant vocalization recordings and assessed their hormonal and
behavioral responses. Males were placed in the testing cage for 10 min under two 
conditions: (a) control condition (exposure to adult conspecific vocalization
recordings), and (b) experimental condition (exposure to infant vocalization
recordings). We recorded the frequency of approach towards the sound source, the 
time spent near it and locomotion frequency of males in the cage under both
conditions. Blood samples were collected after each test for cortisol, measured
by the enzyme immunoassay method. Infant vocalization affects the behavioral and 
hormonal responses of non-reproductive male common marmosets. All males
approached and spent more time near the sound source and showed an increase in
locomotion during infant vocalization exposure compared to the control condition.
Successive exposure to infant vocalization increased the responsiveness in
inexperienced males. Cortisol levels were significantly higher following infant
vocalization exposure compared to the control condition. These findings support
the assumption that sound stimuli from the newborn are critical in initiating and
maintaining caretaker responsiveness and that cortisol seems to be important for 
alertness to sensory stimuli, modulating their motivation to interact with
infants.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a small New World primate; it
originally comes from the Atlantic coastal forests in northeastern Brazil. It has
been attracting much attention in the biomedical research field because of its
size, availability, and unique biological characteristics. Its endocrinological
and behavioral similarity to humans, comparative ease in handling, and high
reproductive efficiency are very advantageous for neuroscience research.
Recently, we developed transgenic common marmosets with germline transmission,
and this technological breakthrough provides a potential paradigm shift by
enabling researchers to investigate complex biological phenomena using
genetically-modified non-human primates. In this review, we summarize recent
progress in marmoset research, and also discuss a potential application of genome
editing tools that should be useful toward the generation of knock-out/knock-in
marmoset models.

Evolutionary genetics and implications of small size and twinning in
callitrichine primates.

New World monkeys (NWMs) are characterized by an extensive size range, with
clawed NWMs (subfamily Callitrichinae, or callitrichines) such as the common
marmoset manifesting diminutive size and unique reproductive adaptations. Perhaps
the most notable of these adaptations is their propensity toward multiple
gestations (i.e., dichorionic twins and trichorionic triplets). Indeed, with the 
exception of Goeldi's monkey (Callimico), callitrichine singleton pregnancies
rarely occur. Multiple gestations seem to have coevolved with a suite of
reproductive adaptations, including hematopoetic chimerism of siblings,
suppression of reproduction in nondominant females, and cooperative
alloparenting. The sequencing of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) genome 
offers the opportunity to explore the genetic basis of these unusual traits
within this primate lineage. In this study, we hypothesized that genetic changes 
arising during callitrichine evolution resulted in multiple ovulated ova with
each cycle, and that these changes triggered adaptations that minimized
complications common to multiple gestations in other primates, including humans. 
Callitrichine-specific nonsynonymous substitutions were identified in GDF9,
BMP15, BMP4, and WFIKKN1. WFIKKN1, a multidomain protease inhibitor that binds
growth factors and bone morphogenetic proteins, has nonsynonymous changes found
exclusively in common marmosets and other tested callitrichine species that twin.
In the one callitrichine species that does not produce twins (Callimico), this
change has reverted back to the ancestral (nontwinning) primate sequence.
Polymorphisms in GDF9 occur among human cohorts with a propensity for dizygotic
twins, and polymorphisms in GDF9 and BMP15 are associated with twinning in sheep.
We postulate that positive selection affected NWM growth patterns, with
callitrichine miniaturization coevolving with a series of reproductive
adaptations.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a laboratory nonhuman primate, is a
well-known model of several human diseases and conditions, but the nutritional
needs of these animals are not fully understood. Here we describe a 4-mo
controlled study in which we increased the dietary fat and protein of subadult
male common marmosets by using healthy snacks. Six male marmosets received their 
normal diet (control), and an additional 6 were given their normal diet
supplemented daily with a 14-kcal snack. Cashews and waxworms were used as the
snack, given their high-fat content. Although body weight did not differ between 
the 2 groups, only control male marmosets showed increased chest circumferences
over the course of the study. Glucoregulatory function remained consistent in the
snack-fed marmosets, whereas control animals had progressed toward higher
insulin. Other indices of glucoregulation indicated significant differences in
adiponectin and the cortisol:cortisone ratio between the 2 groups, but no
differences in lipid concentration were detected. Therefore, the most notable
difference attributable to the snack feeding was improved glucoregulation.
Because the snacks we used had a high proportion of unsaturated compared with
saturated fat, we suggest that these healthy high-fat-high-protein snacks provide
an important contribution to the nutrition of this laboratory species. This study
also demonstrates the utility of marmosets as a model for understanding the
implications of dietary fats in humans.

The increasing use of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) in research makes 
it important to diagnose spontaneous disease that may confound experimental
studies. Bone disease and gastrointestinal disease are two major causes of
morbidity and mortality in captive marmosets, but currently no effective
antemortem tests are available to identify affected animals prior to the terminal
stage of disease. In this study we propose that bone disease and gastrointestinal
disease are associated disease entities in marmosets and aim to establish the
efficacy of several economical antemortem tests in identifying and predicting
disease. Tissues from marmosets were examined to define affected animals and
unaffected controls. Complete blood count, serum chemistry values, body weight,
quantitative radiographs, and tissue-specific biochemical markers were evaluated 
as candidate biomarkers for disease. Bone and gastrointestinal disease were
associated, with marmosets being over seven times more likely to have either
concurrent bone and gastrointestinal disease or neither disease as opposed to
lesions in only one organ system. When used in tandem, serum albumin <3.5 g/dL
and body weight <325 g identified 100% of the marmosets affected with concurrent 
bone and gastrointestinal disease. Progressive body weight loss of 0.05% of peak 
body weight per day predicted which marmosets would develop disease prior to the 
terminal stage. Bone tissue-specific tests, such as quantitative analysis of
radiographs and serum parathyroid hormone levels, were effective for
distinguishing between marmosets with bone disease and those without. These
results provide an avenue for making informed decisions regarding the removal of 
affected marmosets from studies in a timely manner, preserving the integrity of
research results.

We previously demonstrated among several antipsychotics exhibiting potent
dopamine D2 receptor antagonism that only lurasidone,
(1R,2S,3R,4S)-N-[(1R,2R)-2-[4-(1,2-benzisothiazol-3-yl)-1-piperazinylmethyl]-1-cy
clohexylmethyl]-2,3-bicyclo[2.2.1] heptanedicarboximide hydrochloride, improved
performance in the object retrieval detour (ORD) task by marmosets. The
mechanisms by which only lurasidone causes enhancements in cognitive function
have not yet been established; however, most antipsychotics, except for
lurasidone, have been shown to exhibit potent antagonistic activity against the
dopamine D4 receptor. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the role of
the dopamine D4 receptor on executive function with the selective agonist,
Ro10-5824 and antagonist, L-745,870, and elucidate a possible mechanism for the
procognitive effect of lurasidone. The effects of these drugs were evaluated in
naïve marmosets using the ORD task. Changes in the success rate during the
difficult trial in the task were used to assess the cognitive effect of the
drugs. Ro10-5824 (0.3-3 mg/kg) increased the success rate in the difficult trial,
potentiated the effect of lurasidone, and reversed the cognitive impairment
induced by clozapine. Interestingly, the co-administration of L-745,870 with
lurasidone decreased the success rate in the difficult trial, whereas the single 
administration of L-745,870 had no effect. These results suggest that activation 
of the dopamine D4 receptor may improve executive function, whereas concomitant
blockade of dopamine D4 and D2 receptors may have the opposite effect. In
addition to the other unique binding profiles of other monoamine receptors, the
lack of affinity for the dopamine D4 receptor by lurasidone could also
contribute, at least partly, to its cognitive-enhancing effect.

The present study characterized fetal sulcation patterns and gyrification in the 
cerebrum of the New World monkey group, common marmosets, using a 3D T2-weighted 
high-resolution anatomical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequence from the
fixed brain at 7-tesla ex vivo. Fetal sulcation in the marmoset cerebrum began to
indent the lateral fissure and hippocampal sulcus in gestational week (GW) 12,
and then the following sulci emerged: the callosal and calcarine sulci on GW 15; 
the superior temporal sulcus on GW 17; and the circular and occipitotemporal
sulci on GW 18. The degree of cortical convolution was evaluated quantitatively
based on 2D MRI slices by the gyrification index (GI) and based on 3D MRI data by
sulcation index (SI). Both the mean GI and SI increased from GW 16, and were
closely correlated with the cortical volume and the cortical surface area during 
fetal periods (their correlation coefficients marked more than 0.95). After
birth, both the mean GI and SI decreased slightly by 2years of age, whereas the
cortical volume and surface area continuously increased. Notably, histological
analysis showed that the outer subventricular zone (oSVZ) in non-sulcal regions
was thicker than that in the presumptive calcarine sulcal region on GW 13,
preceding the infolding of the calcarine sulcus. The present results showed
definite sulcal infolding on the cerebral cortical surface of the marmosets, with
similar pattern and sequence of their emergences to other higher-order primates
such as macaques and humans. Differential expansion of the oSVZ may be involved
in gyral convolution and sulcal infolding in the developing cerebrum.

Grafting of Neonatal marmoset monkey testicular single-cell suspensions into
immunodeficient mice leads to ex situ testicular cord neomorphogenesis.

Research, Göttingen, Germany.

Single-cell suspensions derived from immature rodent and ungulate testes can
reconstitute testicular cords upon grafting into immunodeficient mice. In the
present study, neonatal common marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus) testes were
digested to a single-cell suspension, which was transplanted subcutaneously into 
immunodeficient mice. After 9 or 18 weeks of incubation, the derivatives of the
grafted single-cell suspensions were retrieved and analyzed histologically and
immunohistochemically. Three of 4 (75%) neonatal grafts exhibited reconstituted
seminiferous cords strongly resembling seminiferous cords of the intact neonatal 
testis. The cords consisted of Sertoli cells, germ cells and peritubular myoid
cells, which was confirmed by immunohistochemical marker analysis.
Three-dimensional reconstruction models of the grafts revealed elongated tubules.
Some of the tubules were branched, which occurs also in vivo, as we show here for
the marmoset monkey. Importantly, no teratoma formation by immature pluripotency 
factor-expressing germ cells was observed. In summary, the reconstituted
testicular cords were almost indistinguishable from the cords formed in situ,
thereby impressively demonstrating a very high reconstructive potential of a
single-cell suspension obtained from the neonatal marmoset monkey testis. To our 
knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating testicular cord neomorphogenesis
for a primate species ex situ.

We histopathologically and immunohistochemically investigated a case of malignant
lymphoma that spontaneously developed in a male common marmoset at two years of
age. Beginning at two years four months of age, the animal had an enlargement of 
the submandibular and inguinal lymph nodes, small subcutaneous nodules near the
right breast and an approximately fivefold increase in peripheral lymphocyte
count compared with the previous examination value. The postmortem findings at
two years eight months of age showed lymphadenopathy with enlargement of the
thymus and spleen. Small- to intermediate-sized neoplastic lymphocytes had
diffusely proliferated in the enlarged nodes. The neoplastic cells were
pleomorphic and had irregularly shaped nuclei. The nuclear chromatin staining
revealed hyperchromatism in the small-sized cells, and the intermediate-sized
cells exhibited vesicular staining. An immunohistochemical examination indicated 
that the neoplastic lymphocytes were positive for CD3 and negative for CD20, thus
suggesting that they had originated from T cells. In addition, the proliferation 
of high endothelial venules and reactive epithelioid histiocytes was observed.
Scattered tingible body-laden macrophages were infrequently detected. Neoplastic 
lymphocytes were also observed in the thymus, spleen, heart, lungs, liver,
kidneys, adrenal glands and femoral and sternal bone marrow. This malignant
lymphoma in a young male common marmoset was considered to fit the category of
"peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS)" according to the
new WHO system of classification.

Burkholderia pseudomallei is a dangerous human pathogen. Phosphoantigens
specifically the target primate specific γ9(+)δ2(+) T cells subset and some have 
been developed as potential immunotherapeutics. Previously, we demonstrated that,
when stimulated with the phosphoantigen CHDMAPP, γ9(+)δ2(+) T cells aid in the
killing of intracellular B. pseudomallei bacteria. Moreover, we found that common
marmoset (Callithrix Jacchus) γ9(+) T cells increase in frequency and respond to 
the phosphoantigen CHDMAPP and/or B. pseudomallei, in combination with IL-2, in a
similar manner to human γ9(+)δ2(+) T cells. Here we evaluate the efficacy of the 
phosphoantigen CHDMAPP, in combination with IL-2, as a therapy against B.
pseudomallei infection, in vivo. We found that the previous studies predicted the
in vivo responsiveness of γ9(+) T cells to the CHDMAPP+IL-2 treatment and
significant expansion of the numbers of peripheral and splenic γ9(+) T cells were
observed. This effect was similar to those reported in other primate species
treated with phosphoantigen. Furthermore, splenocytes were retrieved 7 days post 
onset of treatment, restimulated with CHDMAPP or heat-killed B. pseudomallei and 
the cultured γ9(+) T cells demonstrated no reduction in IFN-γ response when
CHDMAPP+IL-2 animals were compared to IL-2 only treated animals. Using an
established model of B. pseudomallei infection in the marmoset, we assessed the
potential for using phosphoantigen as a novel immunotherapy. The CHDMAPP
treatment regime had no effect on the progression of respiratory melioidosis and 
this was despite the presence of elevated numbers of γ9(+) T cells in the spleen,
liver and lung and an increased proportion of IFN-γ(+) cells in response to
infection. We therefore report that the common marmoset has proven a good model
for studying the effect in vivo of γ9(+) T cell stimulation; however, γ9(+) T
cells have little or no effect on the progression of lethal, respiratory B.
pseudomallei infection.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is increasingly being used as a
non-human primate animal model in biomedical research. To perform accurate
quantitative analysis of gene expression by quantitative reverse transcription
polymerase chain reaction, reliable reference genes should be selected. In this
study, we evaluated the expressions of 11 widely used reference genes: ACTB,
ATP5F1, B2M, GAPDH, HPRT1, PGK1, PPIA, RN18S1, RPLP0, TBP and UBC in 12 tissues
and five brain areas of healthy common marmosets. NormFinder and geNorm indicated
that the most suitable reference genes for cross-sectional studies of the 17
tissues were RN18S1 and RPLP0. Conversely, ACTB and PPIA were the most suitable
for analyzing brain samples; however, the expression of PGK1 fluctuated among
brain areas. These results indicate that suitable reference genes differ between 
the tissues examined. This study provides fundamental information for gene

A thyroid tumour was identified in a 10-year-old male common marmoset (Callithrix
jacchus). The tumour was encapsulated by fibrous connective tissue and compressed
the adjacent normal thyroid. The tumour was composed of variably sized and
irregularly shaped thyroid follicles lined by a single layer of columnar
epithelial cells. Eosinophilic material at the base of the neoplastic cells
stained black with periodic acid-methenamine silver and red with periodic
acid-Schiff. Immunohistochemistry confirmed that this eosinophilic material was
collagen type IV. Ultrastructurally, highly dense and amorphous material was
observed at the base of the neoplastic cells. Small vesicles in the basolateral
cytoplasm of the neoplastic cells contained similar material to that at the base 
of the cells. The tumour was diagnosed as a thyroid follicular adenoma with
accumulation of collagen type IV. This is the first description of an endocrine
tumour with accumulation of collagen type IV in animals.

Cone photopigments (opsins) are crucial elements of, and the first detection
module in, color vision. Individual opsins have different wavelength sensitivity 
patterns, and the temporal and spatial expression patterns of opsins are unique
and stringently regulated. Long and middle wavelength-sensitive (L/M) opsins are 
of the same phylogenetic type. Although the roles of thyroid hormone/TRß2 and
COUP-TFs in the transcriptional regulation of L/M opsins have been explored, the 
detailed mechanisms, including the target sequence in the enhancer of L/M opsins,
have not been revealed. We aimed to reveal molecular mechanisms of L/M opsins in 
vertebrates. Using several human red opsin enhancer/promoter-luciferase reporter 
constructs, we found that TRß2 increased luciferase activities through the 5'-UTR
and intron 3-4 region, whereas the presence of T3 affected only the intron 3-4
region-dependent luciferase activity. Furthermore, COUP-TFII suppressed intron
3-4 region-dependent luciferase activities. However, luciferase expression driven
by the mouse M opsin intron 3-4 region was only slightly increased by TRß2, and
rather enhanced by COUP-TFII. To determine whether these differential responses
reflect differences between primates and rodents, we examined the
enhancer/promoter region of the red opsin of the common marmoset. Interestingly, 
while TRß2 increased 5'-UTR- or intron 3-4 region-driven luciferase expression,
as observed for the human red opsin, expression of the latter luciferase was not 
suppressed by COUP-TFII. In fact, immunostaining of common marmoset retinal
sections revealed expression of COUP-TFII and red opsin in the cone cells.

cell homeodynamics and disease.

Aging is associated with an increased incidence of pathological conditions such
as neurodegeneration, cardiovascular and renal disease, and cancer. These
conditions are believed to be linked to a disruption in cell homeodynamics, which
is regulated by essential trace elements. In this study we used hair elementary
analysis by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS) to examine
age-related profiles of 47 elements in both rats and common marmoset monkeys.
Hair was collected from young adult (6 months) and aged (18 months) Long-Evans
male rats, and young adult (2 years), middle-aged (4 years) and aged (>8 years)
marmosets. The results revealed that aging reduces content levels of cobalt,
potassium and selenium while content levels of aluminium, arsenic, boron,
mercury, molybdenum, and titanium were elevated in aged rats. Similarly, aged
marmosets showed reduced levels of cobalt and elevated levels of aluminium. Case 
studies in aged rats revealed that myocardial infarction was associated with
elevated levels of sodium, potassium and cadmium and reduced zinc, while renal
failure was linked to elevated content of potassium, chloride and boron and
reduced contents of manganese. Carcinoma was linked to elevated arsenic and
reduced selenium levels. These findings indicate that hair elementary profiles in
healthy aging and age-related diseases reflect altered cell and organ metabolic
functions. Cobalt and aluminium in particular may serve as biomarkers of aging in
animal models. Thus, elementary deposition in hair may have predictive and
diagnostic value in age-related pathological conditions, including cardiovascular
and kidney disease and cancer.

aging.

Due to its short lifespan, ease of use and age-related pathologies that mirror
those observed in humans, the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is poised to
become a standard nonhuman primate model of aging. Blood and extracellular fluid 
possess two major thiol-dependent redox nodes involving cysteine (Cys), cystine
(CySS), glutathione (GSH) and glutathione disulfide (GSSG). Alteration in these
plasma redox nodes significantly affects cellular physiology, and oxidation of
the plasma Cys/CySS redox potential (E hCySS) is associated with aging and
disease risk in humans. The purpose of this study was to determine age-related
changes in plasma redox metabolites and corresponding redox potentials (E h) to
further validate the marmoset as a nonhuman primate model of aging. We measured
plasma thiol redox states in marmosets and used existing human data with
multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) to model the relationships
between age and redox metabolites. A classification accuracy of 70.2% and an AUC 
of 0.703 were achieved using the MARS model built from the marmoset redox data to
classify the human samples as young or old. These results show that common
marmosets provide a useful model for thiol redox biology of aging.

The repertoire of MHC class I genes in the common marmoset: evidence for
functional plasticity.

In humans, the classical antigen presentation function of major
histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules is controlled by the human
leukocyte antigen HLA -A, HLA-B and HLA-C loci. A similar observation has been
made for great apes and Old World monkey species. In contrast, a New World monkey
species such as the cotton-top tamarin (Saguinus oedipus) appears to employ the G
locus for its classical antigen presentation function. At present, little is
known about the classical MHC class I repertoire of the common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus), another New World monkey that is widely used in biomedical 
research. In the present population study, no evidence has been found for
abundant transcription of classical I class genes. However, in each common
marmoset, four to seven different G-like alleles were detected, suggesting that
the ancestral locus has been subject to expansion. Segregation studies provided
evidence for at least two G-like genes present per haplotype, which are
transcribed by a variety of cell types. The alleles of these Caja-G genes cluster
in separate lineages, suggesting that the loci diversified considerably after
duplication. Phylogenetic analyses of the introns confirm that the Caja-G loci
cluster in the vicinity of HLA-G, indicating that both genes shared an ancestor. 
In contrast to HLA-G, Caja-G shows considerable polymorphism at the
peptide-binding sites. This observation, together with the lack of detectable
transcripts of A and B-like genes, indicates that Caja-G genes have taken over
the function of classical class I genes. These data highlight the extreme
plasticity of the MHC class I gene system.

Individual differences in behavioural flexibility are a significant issue in
human psychopathology as well as in its animal models. We aimed to investigate
individual variations of operant-choice behaviour in the common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus), a small New World primate, using a new operant panel with
two hand-poking holes.METHODS: Experimental subjects (N=16) were presented with a
choice between a Small & Soon (SS) vs a Large & Late (LL) food reward. After
extensive training (31 daily sessions with no delay, during which a basal,
large-reward preference developed), the delay before release of LL was
progressively increased (from 0 to 60 s, during 16 daily sessions; indifferent
point at delay=9 s). Subjects were classified as either "flexible" or
"non-flexible", respectively, based on a decrease (or not) in the preference for 
LL with increasing delays. Each subject was also classified as "maximizer" (or
"non-maximizer") based on capacity (or not) to maximize the food payoff as delay 
increased.
RESULTS: Upon delays shorter than the indifferent point (<9s), none of the
subjects showed a shift from LL to SS, denoting a lack of delay-induced,
cognitive impulsivity. Individual differences only emerged upon delays longer
than the indifferent point (>9 s), when a preference shift could be interpreted
as economically-driven. In general, a profile of few unrewarded hand-pokes in
reaction to initial delays (i.e., a low motor impulsivity) and of clear-cut basal
LL preference seemed to predict elevated flexibility of choices and better food
payoff, which was typical of subjects classified as both "flexible & maximizer".
CONCLUSION: These results provide normative data on the marmosets, which can be
used as a model for the investigation of 1) individual differences in behavioural
flexibility, as well as 2) biological mechanisms rooted in our evolutionary
history.

The use of the common marmoset monkey in biomedical research has increased
recently, and further attention has been devoted to this model after the
successful production of transgenic marmosets. To extend genetic engineering
approaches to widespread biomedical research fields, efficient prolonged in vitro
culturing of embryo development is necessary. We aimed to evaluate the effects of
the size of the zona pellucida opening on promoting the hatching process in the
marmoset embryo. Piezo-microdrilling of a 6-μm opening in eight embryos resulted 
in four partially hatched embryos and one hatched embryo after 5 days of culture.
Piezo-microdrilling a 20-μm opening in 11 embryos resulted in nine partial
hatchings and no hatched embryos. Piezo-scraping an 80-μm opening in six embryos 
resulted in no partially hatched embryos and five hatched embryos. These results 
suggest that an 80-μm opening, rather than 6-μm or 20-μm openings, is suitable to
complete the hatching process in the marmoset embryo.

In order to directly demonstrate the roles of CD8(+) T lymphocytes in non-human
primates, in vivo depletion of the CD8(+) T cells by administration of a
CD8-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) is one of the crucial techniques.
Recently, the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), which is classified as a New 
World monkey, has been shown useful as an experimental animal model for various
human diseases such as multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease and a number of
infectious diseases. Here we show that an anti-marmoset CD8 mAb 6F10, which we
have recently established, efficiently depletes the marmoset CD8(+) T lymphocytes
in vivo, i.e., the administration of 6F10 induces drastic and specific reduction 
in the ratio of the CD8(+) T cell subset for at least three weeks or longer. Our 
finding will help understand the pivotal role of CD8(+) T cells in vivo in the
control of human diseases.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is now widely used in various research
fields, including toxicology. However, information about the background pathology
of this species is scarce. Here, we report a case of rhabdomyosarcoma that
spontaneously occurred in a common marmoset. A 44-month-old male common marmoset 
was euthanized due to bilateral hind limb paralysis. At necropsy, a 2×2×5-cm
intramuscular mass was observed in the lower right back. Histologically, the mass
was mainly composed of interlacing bundles of spindle-shaped tumor cells.
Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were positive for myogenin, desmin,
vimentin and alpha-smooth muscle actin. Ultrastructurally, the tumor cells
contained bundles of myofilaments with Z-band-like structures. Thus, the tumor
was diagnosed as a rhabdomyosarcoma. To our knowledge, this is the first report
of spontaneous rhabdomyosarcoma that was definitely diagnosed in the common
marmoset.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a small-bodied Neotropical primate
and a useful preclinical animal model for translational research into
autoimmune-mediated inflammatory diseases (AIMID), such as rheumatoid arthritis
(RA) and multiple sclerosis (MS). The animal model for MS established in
marmosets has proven their value for exploratory research into (etio) pathogenic 
mechanisms and for the evaluation of new therapies that cannot be tested in lower
species because of their specificity for humans. Effective usage of the marmoset 
in preclinical immunological research has been hampered by the limited
availability of blood for immunological studies and of reagents for profiling of 
cellular and humoral immune reactions. In this paper, we give a concise overview 
of the procedures and reagents that were developed over the years in our
laboratory in marmoset models of the above-mentioned diseases.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is used as a non-human primate
laboratory animal. Marmoset wasting syndrome (MWS) is a disease endemic to
captive colonies, and the pathogenesis is unclear. In the present study,
marmosets with chronic bloody high-viscosity diarrhea, which is a contributing
factor to MWS, were evaluated, and inflammation in the colon was found.
Calprotectin is a surrogate marker of intestinal inflammation and induces
apoptosis. Marmosets with chronic diarrhea exhibited higher levels of fecal
calprotectin. Histochemical analyses showed high expression of calprotectin in
the extravascular neutrophils and apoptosis in the chronic colitis lesions. No
internal microbiological diseases were identified. Although the cause of chronic 
colitis was not identified, the marmoset could be a useful model of inflammatory 
bowel disease.

Animal models with a high predictive value for human trials are needed to develop
novel human-specific therapeutics for respiratory diseases. The aim of the
present study was to examine lung-function parameters in marmoset monkeys
(Callithrix jacchus) that can be used to detect pharmacologically or
provocation-induced AHR (airway hyper-responsiveness). Therefore a custom-made
lung-function device that allows application of defined aerosol doses during
measurement was developed. It was hypothesized that LPS
(lipopolysaccharide)-challenged marmosets show AHR compared with non-challenged
healthy subjects. Invasive plethysmography was performed in 12 anaesthetized
orotracheally intubated and spontaneously breathing marmosets. Pulmonary data of 
R(L) (lung resistance), C(dyn) (dynamic compliance), EF50 (mid-expiratory flow), 
P(oes) (oesophageal pressure), MV (minute volume), respiratory frequency (f) and 
V(T) (tidal volume) were collected. Measurements were conducted under baseline
conditions and under MCh (methacholine)-induced bronchoconstriction. The
measurement was repeated with the same group of animals after induction of an
acute lung inflammation by intratracheal application of LPS. PDs (provocative
doses) of MCh to achieve a certain increase in RL were significantly lower after 
LPS administration. AHR was demonstrated in the LPS treated compared with the
naïve animals. The recorded lung-function data provide ground for pre-clinical
efficacy and safety testing of anti-inflammatory substances in the common
marmoset, a new translational NHP (non-human primate) model for LPS-induced lung 
inflammation.

Characterization of secretagogin-immunoreactive amacrine cells in marmoset
retina.

The retina contains at least 30 different types of amacrine cells but not many
are well characterized. In the present study the calcium-binding protein
secretagogin was localized in a population of regular and displaced amacrine
cells in the retina of the common marmoset Callithrix jacchus. Irrespective of
their soma location, the dendrites of secretagogin amacrine cells occupy strata
2, 3, and 4 of the inner plexiform layer, between the two bands formed by
cholinergic amacrine cells. Segretagogin amacrine cells are also immunopositive
to antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase, suggesting that they use
γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) as their neurotransmitter. The spatial density of
secretagogin amacrine cells decreases from a peak of about 400 cells/mm(2) near 1
mm eccentricity to less than 100 cells/mm(2) in peripheral retina; these
densities account for about 1% of amacrine cells in the inner nuclear layer and
for up to 27% of displaced amacrine cells. The cell bodies form a regular mosaic,
suggesting that they constitute a single amacrine cell population. Secretagogin
cells have varicose dendrites, which are decorated with small spines.
Intracellular injection of DiI into secretagogin cells revealed an average
dendritic field diameter of 170 μm and an average coverage factor of 3.2. In
summary, secretagogin cells in marmoset retina are medium-field amacrine cells
that share their stratification pattern with narrow-field amacrine cells and
their neurotransmitter with wide-field amacrine cells. They may mediate spatial
inhibition spanning the centralmost (on and off) bands of the inner plexiform
layer.

The extraoral presence of taste signal transduction proteins has recently been
reported in rodents and humans. Here, we report for the first time the presence
of these signal transduction proteins in the caecum of a non-human primate, the
common marmoset. Quantitative RT-PCR data on the gene expression of taste signal 
transduction molecules (gustducin and TRPM5) in common marmosets suggested high
expression in the caecum, which was not observed in other non-human primates.
Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed the specific presence of gustducin and
taste receptors in marmoset caecal cells. These results may relate to the
specific feeding behaviour of marmosets, which consume plant exudates, primarily 
gums.

Cadherins are cell adhesion molecules widely expressed in the nervous system,
where they play various roles in neural patterning, nuclei formation, axon
guidance, and synapse formation and function. Although many published articles
have reported on cadherin expression in rodents and ferrets, there are limited
data on their expression in primate brains. In this study, in situ hybridization 
analysis was performed for 10 cadherins [nine classic cadherins (Cdh4, -6, -7,
-8, -9, -10, -11, -12, and -20) and T-cadherin (Cdh13)] in the developing
postnatal telencephalon of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). Each
cadherin showed broad expression in the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, amygdala,
and hippocampus, as previously shown in the rodent brain. However, detailed
expression patterns differed between rodents and marmosets. In contrast to
rodents, cadherin expression was reduced overall and localized to restricted
areas of the brain during the developmental process, suggesting that cadherins
are more crucially involved in developmental or maturation processes rather than 
in neural functioning. These results also highlight the possibility that
restricted/less redundant cadherin expression allows primate brains to generate
functional diversity among neurons, allowing morphological and functional
differences between rodents and primates.

Communication is important in social species, and may occur with the use of
visual, olfactory or auditory signals. However, visual communication may be
hampered in species that are arboreal have elaborate facial coloring and live in 
small groups. The common marmoset fits these criteria and may have limited visual
communication. Nonetheless, some (contradictive) propositions concerning visual
displays in the common marmoset have been made, yet quantitative data are
lacking. The aim of this study was to assign a behavioral context to different
visual displays using pre-post-event-analyses. Focal observations were conducted 
on 16 captive adult and sub-adult marmosets in three different family groups.
Based on behavioral elements with an unambiguous meaning, four different
behavioral contexts were distinguished: aggression, fear, affiliation, and play
behavior. Visual displays concerned behavior that included facial expressions,
body postures, and pilo-erection of the fur. Visual displays related to
aggression, fear, and play/affiliation were consistent with the literature. We
propose that the visual display "pilo-erection tip of tail" is related to fear.
Individuals receiving these fear signals showed a higher rate of affiliative
behavior. This study indicates that several visual displays may provide cues or
signals of particular social contexts. Since the three displays of fear elicited 
an affiliative response, they may communicate a request of anxiety reduction or
signal an external referent. Concluding, common marmosets, despite being arboreal
and living in small groups, use several visual displays to communicate with
conspecifics and their facial coloration may not hamper, but actually promote the
visibility of visual displays.

BACKGROUND Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can provide in vivo assessment of
tissue damage, allowing evaluation of multiple sclerosis (MS) lesion evolution
over time--a perspective not obtainable with postmortem histopathology.
Relapsing-remitting experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is an
experimental model of MS that can be induced in the common marmoset, a small new 
world primate, and that causes perivenular white matter (WM) lesions similar to
those observed in MS. METHODS Brain lesion development and evolution were studied
in vivo and postmortem in four marmosets with EAE through serial T2- and
T2*-weighted scans at 7-tesla. Supratentorial WM lesions were identified and
characterized. RESULTS Of 97 lesions observed, 86 (88%) were clearly perivenular,
and 62 (72%) developed around veins that were visible even prior to EAE
induction. The perivenular configuration was confirmed by postmortem
histopathology. Most affected veins, and their related perivascular Virchow-Robin
spaces, passed into the subarachnoid space rather than the ventricles. CONCLUSION
As in human MS, the intimate association between small veins and EAE lesions in
the marmoset can be studied with serial in vivo MRI. This further strengthens the
usefulness of this model for understanding the process of perivenular lesion
development and accompanying tissue destruction in MS.

Comparison of three different sedative-anaesthetic protocols (ketamine,
ketamine-medetomidine and alphaxalone) in common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus).

Bakker J, Uilenreef JJ, Pelt ER, Brok HP, Remarque EJ, Langermans JA.

BACKGROUND: Handling of common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) usually requires
chemical restraint. Ketamine has been associated with muscle damage in primates, 
while common marmosets, compared to other primates, additionally display an
exceptional high sensitivity to ketamine-associated side-effects. Notably, muscle
twitching movements of limbs and hands, and a marked increase in salivation are
observed. We investigated two alternative intramuscular (i.m.) immobilisation
protocols against ketamine (50 mg/kg; protocol 1) in a double-blind randomised
crossover study in ten healthy adult common marmosets for use as a safe reliable,
short-term immobilisation and sedation. These protocols comprised: alphaxalone
(12 mg/kg; protocol 2) and 25 mg/kg ketamine combined with 0.50 mg/kg
medetomidine (reversal with 2.5 mg/kg atipamezole; protocol 3A). Following
completion and unblinding, the project was extended with an additional protocol
(3B), comprising 25 mg/kg ketamine combined with 0.05 mg/kg medetomidine
(reversal with 0.25 mg/kg atipamezole, twice with 35 min interval).
RESULTS: All protocols in this study provided rapid onset (induction times
<5 min) of immobilisation and sedation. Duration of immobilisation was
31.23 ± 22.39 min, 53.72 ± 13.08 min, 19.73 ± 5.74 min, and 22.78 ± 22.37 min for
protocol 1, 2, 3A, and 3B, respectively. Recovery times were 135.84 ± 39.19 min, 
55.79 ± 11.02 min, 405.46 ± 29.81 min, and 291.91 ± 80.34 min, respectively.
Regarding the quality, and reliability (judged by pedal withdrawal reflex,
palpebral reflex and muscle tension) of all protocols, protocol 2 was the most
optimal. Monitored vital parameters were within clinically acceptable limits
during all protocols and there were no fatalities. Indication of muscle damage as
assessed by AST, LDH and CK values was most prominent elevated in protocol 1, 3A,
and 3B.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that intramuscular administration of 12 mg/kg
alphaxalone to common marmosets is preferred over other protocols studied.
Protocol 2 resulted in at least comparable immobilisation quality with acceptable
and less frequent side effects and superior recovery quality. In all protocols,
supportive therapy, such as external heat support, remains mandatory. Notably, an
unacceptable long recovery period in both ketamine/medetomidine protocols
(subsequently reversed with atipamezole) was observed, showing that α-2
adrenoreceptor agonists in the used dose and dosing regime is not the first
choice for sedation in common marmosets in a standard research setting.

Experimental primate embryology has been hampered by limited access to embryos.
In addition to surgical techniques, the less stressful non-surgical technique of 
uterine flushing has been developed but has had only limitedly used in recovering
pre-implantation embryos from marmoset monkeys. In this study, we introduce the
use of ultrasonography during marmoset non-surgical uterine flushing to make the 
cannulation easier, to further reduce stress, and to ensure thorough uterine
flushing. We were able to cannulate in 99% of the transcervical cannulation
attempts, repeat the flushing up to 17 times with the same animal, and recover up
to 90% of the ovulation products. We also found that 8-cell or earlier stage
embryos could be frequently obtained by non-surgical uterine flushing at 4 or 5
days after ovulation. The easiness and effectiveness of this novel
ultrasound-guided technique will enable more research groups to study marmoset
embryology and facilitate progress in this field.

Existing small-animal models of tuberculosis (TB) rarely develop cavitary
disease, limiting their value for assessing the biology and dynamics of this
highly important feature of human disease. To develop a smaller primate model
with pathology similar to that seen in humans, we experimentally infected the
common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) with diverse strains of Mycobacterium
tuberculosis of various pathogenic potentials. These included recent isolates of 
the modern Beijing lineage, the Euro-American X lineage, and M. africanum. All
three strains produced fulminant disease in this animal with a spectrum of
progression rates and clinical sequelae that could be monitored in real time
using 2-deoxy-2-[(18)F]fluoro-d-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography
(PET)/computed tomography (CT). Lesion pathology at sacrifice revealed the entire
spectrum of lesions observed in human TB patients. The three strains produced
different rates of progression to disease, various extents of extrapulmonary
dissemination, and various degrees of cavitation. The majority of live births in 
this species are twins, and comparison of results from siblings with different
infecting strains allowed us to establish that the infection was highly
reproducible and that the differential virulence of strains was not simply host
variation. Quantitative assessment of disease burden by FDG-PET/CT provided an
accurate reflection of the pathology findings at necropsy. These results suggest 
that the marmoset offers an attractive small-animal model of human disease that
recapitulates both the complex pathology and spectrum of disease observed in
humans infected with various M. tuberculosis strain clades.

and rAAV9.

Profiles of recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV)-mediated transduction show 
interspecies differences for each AAV serotype. Robust long-term transgene
expression is generally observed in rodents, whereas insufficient transduction is
seen in animals with more advanced immune systems. Non-human primates, including 
the common marmoset, could provide appropriate models for neuromuscular diseases 
because of their higher brain functions and physiological resemblance to humans. 
Strategies to induce pathologies in the neuromuscular tissues of non-human
primates by rAAV-mediated transduction are promising; however, transgene
expression patterns with rAAV transduction have not been elucidated in marmosets.
In this study, transduction of adult marmoset skeletal muscle with rAAV9 led to
robust and persistent enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) expression that
was independent of the muscle fiber type, although lymphocyte infiltration was
recognized. Systemic rAAV injection into pregnant marmosets led to transplacental
fetal transduction. Surprisingly, the intraperitoneal injection of rAAV1 and
rAAV9 into the neonatal marmoset resulted in systemic transduction and persistent
transgene expression without lymphocyte infiltration. Skeletal and cardiac muscle
were effectively transduced with rAAV1 and rAAV9, respectively. Interestingly,
rAAV9 transduction led to intense EGFP signaling in the axons of the corpus
callosum. These transduction protocols with rAAV will be useful for investigating
gene functions in the neuromuscular tissues and developing gene therapy
strategies.Molecular Therapy-Nucleic Acids (2013) 2, e95;

The role of harmonic resolvability in pitch perception in a vocal nonhuman
primate, the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).

Pitch is one of the most fundamental percepts in the auditory system and can be
extracted using either spectral or temporal information in an acoustic signal.
Although pitch perception has been extensively studied in human subjects, it is
far less clear how nonhuman primates perceive pitch. We have addressed this
question in a series of behavioral studies in which marmosets, a vocal nonhuman
primate species, were trained to discriminate complex harmonic tones differing in
either spectral (fundamental frequency [f0]) or temporal envelope (repetition
rate) cues. We found that marmosets used temporal envelope information to
discriminate pitch for acoustic stimuli with higher-order harmonics and lower f0 
values and spectral information for acoustic stimuli with lower-order harmonics
and higher f0 values. We further measured frequency resolution in marmosets using
a psychophysical task in which pure tone thresholds were measured as a function
of notched noise masker bandwidth. Results show that only the first four
harmonics are resolved at low f0 values and up to 16 harmonics are resolved at
higher f0 values. Resolvability in marmosets is different from that in humans,
where the first five to nine harmonics are consistently resolved across most f0
values, and is likely the result of a smaller marmoset cochlea. In sum, these
results show that marmosets use two mechanisms to extract pitch (harmonic
templates [spectral] for resolved harmonics, and envelope extraction [temporal]
for unresolved harmonics) and that species differences in stimulus resolvability 
need to be taken into account when investigating and comparing mechanisms of
pitch perception across animals.

fMRI has established itself as the main research tool in neuroscience and brain
cognitive research. The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a non-human
primate model of increasing interest in biomedical research. However, commercial 
MRI coils for marmosets are not generally available. The present work describes
the design and construction of a four-channel receive-only surface RF coil array 
with excellent signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) specifically optimized for fMRI
experiments in awake marmosets in response to somatosensory stimulation. The
array was designed as part of a helmet-based head restraint system used to
prevent motion during the scans. High SNR was obtained by building the coil array
using a thin and flexible substrate glued to the inner surface of the restraint
helmet, so as to minimize the distance between the array elements and the
somatosensory cortex. Decoupling between coil elements was achieved by partial
geometrical overlapping and by connecting them to home-built low-input-impedance 
preamplifiers. In vivo images show excellent coverage of the brain cortical
surface with high sensitivity near the somatosensory cortex. Embedding the coil
elements within the restraint helmet allowed fMRI data in response to
somatosensory stimulation to be collected with high sensitivity and
reproducibility in conscious, awake marmosets.

cord injury.

In the present study, we used microelectrode recordings of multiunit responses to
evaluate patterns of the reactivation of somatosensory cortex after sensory loss 
produced by spinal cord lesions in the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).
These New World monkeys have become a popular model in studies of cortical
organization and function. Primary somatosensory cortex and adjoining
somatosensory areas can become extensively deactivated by lesions of
somatosensory afferents as they ascend in the dorsal columns of the cervical
spinal cord. Six to 7 weeks after complete lesions of the cuneate fasciculus
subserving the forelimb at cervical levels 5-6, the hand region in contralateral 
areas 3b and 1 was reactivated by inputs from the forelimb, but excluded
representations of some or all digits. In a similar manner, recording sites from 
the forelimb region of areas 2-5 responded to parts of the forelimb but not to
digits after an extensive lesion of the contralateral cuneate fasciculus at
C5-C6. Lesions that damaged only the gracile fasciculus or a small percentage of 
the cuneate fasciculus did not produce changes in the gross hand representation
in contralateral areas 3b, 3a, 1, and 2. Finally, a complete but lower lesion of 
the cuneate fasciculus at C8 produced some abnormalities in the reactivation, but
the digits were represented. The results indicate that areas 3a, 3b, 1, and 2-5
of the somatosensory cortex are extensively reactivated after large, apparently
complete lesions of the contralateral cuneate fasciculus, but afferents from the 
digits may not contribute to their reactivation.

The purpose of this study was to determine the protein amounts of blood-brain
barrier (BBB) permeability-related transporters, receptors, and tight junction
proteins in Sprague Dawley and Wistar rats and common marmoset, and also to
investigate inter-species and inter-strain differences across rodents and
primates. Quantification of target proteins in isolated brain capillaries was
conducted by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry-based quantitative
targeted absolute proteomics, with in silico peptide selection. Most target
proteins showed inter-rodent, inter-primate species, and inter-rat strain
differences of less than 2-fold. Comparison of rat and human BBB showed that
P-glycoprotein, multidrug resistance-associated protein 4, monocarboxylate
transporter 1, l-type amino acid transporter, and organic anion transporter 3
exhibited differences of more than two-fold in protein abundance, whereas the
amounts of breast cancer resistance protein, glucose transporter 1, and insulin
receptor were similar in rat and human. In contrast, the differences between
marmoset and human BBB were less than 2-fold for almost all measured proteins.
Thus, the molecular basis of BBB functions may be similar in marmoset and human, 
whereas that of rats shows significant differences. The marmoset may be a good
model to access in vivo human BBB permeability characteristics, as an alternative
to rat and macaque monkey.

BACKGROUND: Chromosomal analyses were performed for marmosets from two colonies -
Deutsches Primatenzentrum (DPZ) and Biomedical Primate Research Centre (BPRC).
Chlorine-based disinfectants are used in DPZ; no chemical disinfection is applied
in BPRC.
METHODS: The rates of chromosomal non-disjunction, polyploidy and
endoreduplication were investigated after G-banding.
RESULTS: For DPZ monkeys, the mean rates of non-disjunction were 7.6% for bone
marrow and 11.3% for lymphocytes. The polyploidy level was 2.5% in bone marrow
and 0.8% in blood. Frequency of endoreduplication in bone marrow and in
leucocytes was 0.5% and 0.8%, respectively. For BPRC, the rate of non-disjunction
in leucocytes (1.3%) was significantly lower than that for DPZ; the polyploidy
rate (0.2%) in blood was lower than that in DPZ; endoreduplication was not
observed.
CONCLUSION: The levels of chromosomal disorders are elevated for DPZ colony. We
suggest that the increased rate of chromosomal disorders in DPZ marmosets can be 
related to the chemical disinfection of their environment.

Noisy acoustic environments present several challenges for the evolution of
acoustic communication systems. Among the most significant is the need to limit
degradation of spectro-temporal signal structure in order to maintain
communicative efficacy. This can be achieved by selecting for several potentially
complementary processes. Selection can act on behavioral mechanisms permitting
signalers to control the timing and occurrence of signal production to avoid
acoustic interference. Likewise, the signal itself may be the target of
selection, biasing the evolution of its structure to comprise acoustic features
that avoid interference from ambient noise or degrade minimally in the habitat.
Here, we address the latter topic for common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus)
long-distance contact vocalizations, known as phee calls. Our aim was to test
whether this vocalization is specifically adapted for transmission in a
species-typical forest habitat, the Atlantic forests of northeastern Brazil. We
combined seasonal analyses of ambient habitat acoustics with experiments in which
pure tones, clicks, and vocalizations were broadcast and rerecorded at different 
distances to characterize signal degradation in the habitat. Ambient sound was
analyzed from intervals throughout the day and over rainy and dry seasons,
showing temporal regularities across varied timescales. Broadcast experiment
results indicated that the tone and click stimuli showed the typically inverse
relationship between frequency and signaling efficacy. Although marmoset phee
calls degraded over distance with marked predictability compared with artificial 
sounds, they did not otherwise appear to be specially designed for increased
transmission efficacy or minimal interference in this habitat. We discuss these
data in the context of other similar studies and evidence of potential behavioral
mechanisms for avoiding acoustic interference in order to maintain effective
vocal communication in common marmosets.

A new-born (8-day-old) male marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) was found dead in a
zoo. The littermate and parents had no clinical abnormalities. By gross
observations at necropsy, there were moderate to severe multiple necrotic foci in
the liver and heart. Histopathological examinations also revealed mild focal
necrosis with neutrophilic infiltration in the cerebral cortex. By Giemsa stained
sections, intracytoplasmic bundles of large bacilli were observed in the
hepatocytes, intestinal epithelial cells, cardiac myocytes and neuronal cells
around the necrotic lesions. Immunohistochemically, these bacilli were intensely 
positive for rabbit sera against Clostridium piliforme, RT and MSK strains.
Although Tyzzer's disease has been rarely reported in primates, the central
nervous system (CNS) lesions by Clostridium piliforme infections are very
unusual.

The common marmoset is a new world monkey, which has become a valuable
experimental animal for biomedical research. This study developed cDNA libraries 
for the common marmoset from five different tissues. A total of 290 426
high-quality EST sequences were obtained, where 251 587 sequences (86.5%) had
homology (1E(-100)) with the Refseqs of six different primate species, including 
human and marmoset. In parallel, 270 673 sequences (93.2%) were aligned to the
human genome. When 247 090 sequences were assembled into 17 232 contigs, most of 
the sequences (218 857 or 15 089 contigs) were located in exonic regions,
indicating that these genes are expressed in human and marmoset. The other 5578
sequences (or 808 contigs) mapping to the human genome were not located in exonic
regions, suggesting that they are not expressed in human. Furthermore, a
different set of 118 potential coding sequences were not similar to any Refseqs
in any species, and, thus, may represent unknown genes. The cDNA libraries
developed in this study are available through RIKEN Bio Resource Center. A Web
server for the marmoset cDNAs is available at
http://marmoset.nig.ac.jp/index.html, where each marmoset EST sequence has been
annotated by reference to the human genome. These new libraries will be a useful 
genetic resource to facilitate research in the common marmoset.

Among primates, the common marmoset is suitable for primate embryology research. 
Its small body size, however, has delayed the technical development of efficient 
embryo transfer. Furthermore, three factors have been determined to adversely
affect the performance of marmoset embryo transfer: nonsurgical approaches, the
use of cryopreserved embryos, and the use of late-stage embryos. Here we
performed embryo transfer under conditions that included the above three factors 
and using either a small (1 μl or less) or a large volume (2-3 μl) of medium. The
pregnancy and birth rates were 50% (5/10) and 27% (3/11), respectively, when
using the large volume, and 80% (8/10) and 75% (9/12), respectively, when using
the small volume. The latter scores exceed those of previous reports using
comparable conditions. Thus, it appears that these three previously considered
factors could be overcome, and we propose that reducing the transfer volume to 1 
μl or less is essential for successful marmoset embryo transfer.

The purpose of this study was to establish an experimental glaucoma model in the 
common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). Chronic intraocular pressure (IOP)
elevation was induced by laser trabeculoplasty twice at 2-week intervals in the
left eyes of 4 common marmosets. IOP was measured before and at 4, 7, 8, 11, 13
weeks after first laser treatment, and ophthalmoscopic examinations were also
performed. At 13 weeks after laser treatment, each eye was enucleated, and
retinal cross-sections and optic nerve were prepared for histological
examination. Mean IOP values measured at the above 5 time points were over 40
mmHg in laser-treated eyes in 3 marmosets, but IOP in one marmoset was
transiently increased to 26.6 mmHg at 7 weeks and then declined to the baseline
level. In ophthalmoscopy, deepened and enlarged optic disc cupping, depending on 
the extent of IOP elevation and duration, were observed in laser-treated eyes of 
3 marmosets with persistent IOP elevation, but there was no apparent change in
the optic disc in the laser-treated eye of one marmoset with transient IOP
elevation. Histological examination showed marked atrophy with deepened and
enlarged cupping of optic disc, thinning of retinal nerve fiber layer and retinal
ganglion loss in the retina, and axonal atrophy and loss in the optic nerve,
depending on the extent of IOP elevation and duration. In conclusion, we
succeeded in producing an experimental glaucoma model in the common marmoset, and
this model may be useful in elucidating the pathophysiological mechanism for
glaucoma.

Comparative analysis of protocadherin-11 X-linked expression among postnatal
rodents, non-human primates, and songbirds suggests its possible involvement in
brain evolution.

BACKGROUND: Protocadherin-11 is a cell adhesion molecule of the cadherin
superfamily. Since, only in humans, its paralog is found on the Y chromosome, it 
is expected that protocadherin-11X/Y plays some role in human brain evolution or 
sex differences. Recently, a genetic mutation of protocadherin-11X/Y was reported
to be associated with a language development disorder. Here, we compared the
expression of protocadherin-11 X-linked in developing postnatal brains of mouse
(rodent) and common marmoset (non-human primate) to explore its possible
involvement in mammalian brain evolution. We also investigated its expression in 
the Bengalese finch (songbird) to explore a possible function in animal
vocalization and human language faculties.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Protocadherin-11 X-linked was strongly expressed 
in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, amygdala and brainstem. Comparative analysis
between mice and marmosets revealed that in certain areas of marmoset brain, the 
expression was clearly enriched. In Bengalese finches, protocadherin-11 X-linked 
was expressed not only in nuclei of regions of the vocal production pathway and
the tracheosyringeal hypoglossal nucleus, but also in areas homologous to the
mammalian amygdala and hippocampus. In both marmosets and Bengalese finches, its 
expression in pallial vocal control areas was developmentally regulated, and no
clear expression was seen in the dorsal striatum, indicating a similarity between
songbirds and non-human primates.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results suggest that the enriched expression of
protocadherin-11 X-linked is involved in primate brain evolution and that some
similarity exists between songbirds and primates regarding the neural basis for
vocalization.

OBJECTIVE: The common marmoset as a model of early obesity was assessed. The
hypotheses that juvenile marmosets with excess adipose tissue will display higher
fasting glucose, decreased insulin sensitivity, and decreased ability to clear
glucose from the blood stream were tested.
DESIGN AND METHODS: Normal and obese (body fat > 14%) common marmoset infants (N 
= 39) were followed up from birth until 1 year. Body fat was measured by
quantitative magnetic resonance. Circulating glucose was measured by glucometer
and insulin, adiponectin, and leptin by commercial assays. The quantitative
insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI; a measure of insulin sensitivity) was
calculated for subjects with fasting glucose and insulin measures. Oral glucose
tolerance tests (OGTTs) were conducted at 12 months on 35 subjects.
RESULTS: At 6 months, obese subjects already had significantly lower insulin
sensitivity (mean QUICKI = 0.378 ± 0.029 vs. 0.525 ± 0.019, N = 11, P = 0.003).
By 12 months, obese subjects also had higher fasting glucose (129.3 ± 9.1 mg/dL
vs. 106.1 ± 6.5 mg/dL, P = 0.042), and circulating adiponectin tended to be lower
(P = 0.057). Leptin was associated with percent body fat; however, birth weight
also influenced circulating leptin. The OGTT results demonstrated that obese
animals had a decreased ability to clear glucose.
CONCLUSIONS: Early-onset obesity in marmosets results in impaired glucose
homeostasis by 1 year.

marmoset monkeys.

and Aging, University of Texas Health Science Center San Antonio, Texas, USA.

OBJECTIVE: Increasing prevalence of childhood obesity and associated risks of
adult type disease have led to worldwide concern. It remains unclear how genetic 
predisposition, environmental exposure to obesogenic food, and developmental
programming interact to lead to overweight and obese children. The development of
a nonhuman primate model of obesity, and particularly juvenile obesity, is an
important step to elucidating the factors associated with obesity and evaluating 
intervention strategies.
DESIGN AND METHODS: Infant marmosets were followed from birth to 12 months of
age. Feeding phenotypes were determined through the use of behavioral
observation, solid food intake trials, and liquid feeding trials monitored via
lickometer.
RESULTS: Marmosets found to be obese at 12 months of age (more than 14% body fat)
start consuming solid food sooner and initiate more time off of care givers.
These individuals developed stable feeding phenotypes that included being more
efficient consumers during liquid intake trials, drinking more grams of diet per 
contact with the licksit.
CONCLUSIONS: The weaning process appears to be particularly important in the
development of feeding phenotypes and the development of juvenile obesity for the
marmosets, and thus this is the time that should be focused upon for intervention
testing in both nonhuman primates and children.

Abnormalities in the processes of the generation and/or pruning of dendritic
spines have been implicated in several mental disorders including autism and
schizophrenia. We have chosen to examine the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus)
as a primate model to explore the processes. As a first step, we studied the
postnatal development of basal dendritic trees and spines of layer-III pyramidal 
cells in the primary visual sensory cortex (V1), a visual association cortex
(inferior temporal area, TE), and a prefrontal cortex (area 12, PFC). Basal
dendrites in all three areas were longer in adulthood compared with those in the 
newborn. In particular, rapid dendritic growth occurred in both TE and PFC around
the second postnatal month. This early growth spurt resulted in much larger
dendritic arbors in TE and PFC than in V1. The density of the spines along the
dendrites peaked at 3 months of age and declined afterwards in all three areas:
the degree of spine pruning being greater in V1 than in TE and PFC. The estimates
of the total numbers of spines in the basal dendrites of a single pyramidal cell 
were larger in TE and PFC than in V1 throughout development and peaked around 3
months after birth in all three areas. These developmental profiles of spines and
dendrites will help in determining assay points for the screening of molecules
involved in spinogenesis and pruning in the marmoset cortex.

Purpose was to adapt structural and quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
from humans to common marmoset monkeys on a clinical 3T scanner and to
demonstrate the value for translational research. Three-dimensional T1- and
T2-weighted MRI and gradient echo-based multi-parameter mapping was performed on 
nine adult animals using a wrist coil. Structural MRI was applied in a model of
targeted experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Magnetization transfer 
(MT) and T1 parameter maps were used to depict axon-rich cortical areas. After
intraveneous triple dose of gadobutrol, the excretion half-time was determined
from consecutive measurements of R1=1/T1. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was
performed at 1mm resolution. At 0.4mm resolution, total measurement time (30 min)
was compatible with injection anesthesia, permitting rapid screening and frequent
follow-up. Structural MRI depicted the EAE lesion in white matter. Quantitative
values of T1, MT, and R2* in marmoset brain were comparable to humans, except for
smaller R2* indicating lower iron content in basal ganglia. The middle temporal
V5 area and the cortical layer IV could be identified, but were considerably
better delineated when averaging two images at 0.33 mm resolution (70 min). A
similar distribution volume (23%), but a shorter excretion half time than in
humans (30 min) was observed. DTI was feasible only in larger structures, such as
major axonal tracts. High-resolution MRI of common marmosets proved feasible
using clinical MRI hardware. A rapid 3D examination protocol was established for 
screening under injection anesthesia, thus avoiding the adverse effects of
inhalation anesthesia.

(1)Pathology Unit, German Primate Center, Göttingen, Germany.

BACKGROUND: The objective of this investigation was to define the phenotype and
spatial distribution of Clara cells within the respiratory tract of common
marmosets and to distinguish them from other non-ciliated cells (goblet cells,
mixed type secretory cells).
METHODS: Non-ciliated cells were identified immunohistochemically using
antibodies against Clara cell secretory protein and mucin 5AC. Transmission
electron microscopy and scanning electron microscopy were performed to
characterize Clara cells ultrastructurally.
RESULTS: Clara cells were present throughout the tracheobronchial tree, with
lowest numbers in the trachea and highest numbers in bronchioles. Goblet cells
and mixed type cells were scarce in the upper conducting airways and virtually
absent within bronchioles. Ultrastructurally, Clara cells showed typical apical
electron-dense granules and a prominent granular endoplasmatic reticulum.
CONCLUSIONS: Clara cells of common marmosets have species-specific morphological 
characteristics, which suggest grouping the common marmoset phenotypically
between primates and rodents.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is considered a novel experimental
animal model of non-human primates. However, due to antibody unavailability,
immunological and pathological studies have not been adequately conducted in
various disease models of common marmoset. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) is a
powerful tool to examine gene expression levels. Recent reports have shown that
selection of internal reference housekeeping genes are required for accurate
normalization of gene expression. To develop a reliable qPCR method in common
marmoset, we used geNorm applets to evaluate the expression stability of eight
candidate reference genes (GAPDH, ACTB, rRNA, B2M, UBC, HPRT, SDHA and TBP) in
various tissues from laboratory common marmosets. geNorm analysis showed that
GAPDH, ACTB, SDHA and TBP were generally ranked high in stability followed by
UBC. In contrast, HPRT, rRNA and B2M exhibited lower expression stability than
other genes in most tissues analyzed. Furthermore, by using the improved qPCR
with selected reference genes, we analyzed the expression levels of CD antigens
(CD3ε, CD4, CD8α and CD20) and cytokines (IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10,
IL-12β, IL-13, IFN-γ and TNF-α) in peripheral blood leukocytes and compared them 
between common marmosets and humans. The expression levels of CD4 and IL-4 were
lower in common marmosets than in humans whereas those of IL-10, IL-12β and IFN-γ
were higher in the common marmoset. The ratio of Th1-related gene expression
level to that of Th2-related genes was inverted in common marmosets. We confirmed
the inverted ratio of CD4 to CD8 in common marmosets by flow cytometric analysis.
Therefore, the difference in Th1/Th2 balance between common marmosets and humans 
may affect host defense and/or disease susceptibility, which should be carefully 
considered when using common marmoset as an experimental model for biomedical
research.

Metabolic assessment of a non-human primate model of metabolic syndrome and
obesity requires the necessary biomarkers specific to the species. While the
rhesus monkey has a number of specific assays for assessing metabolic syndrome,
the marmoset does not. Furthermore, the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) has 
a small blood volume that necessitates using a single blood volume for multiple
analyses. The common marmoset holds a great potential as an alternative primate
model for the study of human disease but assay methods need to be developed and
validated for the biomarkers of metabolic syndrome. Here we report on the
adaptation, development, and validation of commercially available immunoassays
for common marmoset samples in small volumes. We have performed biological
validations for insulin, adiponectin, leptin, and ghrelin to demonstrate the use 
of these biomarkers in examining metabolic syndrome and other related diseases in
the common marmoset.

Spontaneous progressive glomerulonephropathy often occurs in common marmosets.
However, there are few detailed reports concerning the age-related progressive
process of glomerular changes. We discuss the glomerular changes in the early
stage and the progressive changes in the advanced stage of nephropathy. We
investigated the kidneys of common marmosets (2-11 years old; 9 males and 12
females) using hematoxylin and eosin, periodic acid-Schiff, periodic
acid-methenamine-silver, and Masson's trichrome (MT) stains and a transmission
electron microscope. There was no remarkable change in urine cytology,
hematology, or blood chemistry. In the early stage of nephropathy, effacement of 
podocyte foot processes was observed ultrastructurally even though there were no 
marked glomerular lesions in the light microscopy. Subsequently, mesangial
proliferation occurred from the hilar to peripheral side along the tuft. In the
middle stage, red deposits were visible at the glomerular basement membrane (GBM)
and the mesangial region directly under the GBM (paramesangial area) with the MT 
stain. Electron dense deposits were seen at the same area. In the advanced stage,
the irregularity became prominent with or without dense deposits. It is necessary
to investigate in detail whether the change of podocyte in the early stage was
immuno-mediated or due to podocyte failure.

Marburg virus causes a highly infectious and lethal haemorrhagic fever in
primates and may be exploited as a potential biothreat pathogen. To combat the
infection and threat of Marburg haemorrhagic fever, there is a need to develop
and license appropriate medical countermeasures. To determine whether the common 
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) would be an appropriate model to assess therapies
against Marburg haemorrhagic fever, initial susceptibility, lethality and
pathogenesis studies were performed. Low doses of virus, between 4 and 28 TCID50 
, were sufficient to cause a lethal, reproducible infection. Animals became
febrile between days 5 and 6, maintaining a high fever before succumbing to
disease between 8 and 11 days postchallenge. Typical signs of Marburg virus
infection were observed including haemorrhaging and a transient rash. In
pathogenesis studies, virus was isolated from the animals' lungs from day 3
postchallenge and from the liver, spleen and blood from day 5 postchallenge.
Early signs of histopathology were apparent in the kidney and liver from day 3.
The most striking features were observed in animals exhibiting severe clinical
signs, which included high viral titres in all organs, with the highest levels in
the blood, increased levels in liver function enzymes and blood clotting times,
decreased levels in platelets, multifocal moderate-to-severe hepatitis and
perivascular oedema.

Embryonic stem cells of the non-human primate Callithrix jacchus can be
differentiated into definitive endoderm by Activin-A but not IDE-1/2.

Pluripotent stem cells hold great promise for regenerative medicine, due to their
unlimited self-renewal potential and the ability to differentiate into all
somatic cell types. Differences between the rodent disease models and the
situation in humans can be narrowed down with non-human primate models. The
common marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus) is an interesting model for
biomedical research because these animals are easy to breed, get relatively old
(≤ 13 years), are small in size, are relatively cost-effective and have a high
genetic proximity to the human. In particular, diseases of the liver and pancreas
are interesting for cell replacement therapies but the in vitro differentiation
of ESCs into the definitive endoderm germ layer is still a demanding task.
Membrane-permeable, chemically defined small molecules can possibly replace
recombinant growth factors used in most directed differentiation protocols.
However, the potent small molecules IDE-1 and IDE-2 were not able to induce
definitive endoderm-like cells when ESCs from the common marmoset were treated
with these compounds, whereas the recombinant growth factor Activin A could force
the differentiation into this lineage. Our results indicate that ESCs from the
common marmoset are less sensitive or even insensitive to these small molecules. 
Thus, differences between the species of human ESCs and ESCs of this non-human
primate might be a useful model to further evaluate the exact mode of action of
these compounds.

An assessment of common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) γ9(+) T cells and their
response to phosphoantigen in vitro.

γ9δ2 T cells are a primate-specific γδ T cell subtype that expand and become
activated during infection, responding directly to phosphoantigens which are
by-products of essential metabolic pathways in both bacteria and mammals.
Analogues of natural phosphoantigens have been developed as potential
immunotherapeutics for treatment of tumours and infectious diseases. Several
non-human primate models have been used in preclinical studies, however, little
is known about marmoset γ9δ2 T cell responses. We identified γ9(+) T cells in
various tissues in the marmoset and determined that these cells respond to
phosphoantigen in a similar manner to human γ9δ2 T cells in vitro. Both human
γ9δ2 T cells and marmoset γ9(+) T cells were able to reduce growth of the
intracellular bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei in vitro following expansion
with phosphoantigen. This suggests that the marmoset is an appropriate model for 
examining the immunotherapeutic potential of compounds which target γ9δ2 T cells.

The common marmoset is a promising species for evaluating the safety of drug
candidates. To further understand the capacity for drug metabolism in marmosets, 
a cDNA encoding a CYP2B enzyme was cloned from the total RNA fraction of marmoset
liver by 3'- and 5'-RACE methods. Nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences
showed 90.8 and 86.2% identity, respectively, with human CYP2B6. The marmoset
CYP2B6 (marCYP2B6) protein was expressed in insect cells, and its enzymatic
properties were compared with those of human (humCYP2B6) and cynomolgus monkey
(cynCYP2B6) orthologs in liver and insect cell microsomes. Enzymatic functions
were examined for the oxidation of 7-ethoxy-4-(trifluoromethyl)coumarin (7-ETC), 
bupropion (BUP) and efavirenz (EFV). The kinetic profiles for the oxidation of
the three substrates by liver microsomal fractions were similar between humans
and cynomolgus monkeys (biphasic for 7-ETC and monophasic for BUP and EFV), but
that of marmosets was unique (monophasic for 7-ETC and biphasic for BUP and EFV).
Recombinant enzymes, humCYP2B6 and cynCYP2B6, also yielded similar kinetic
profiles for the oxidation of the three substrates, whereas marCYP2B6 showed
activity only for 7-ETC hydroxylation. In silico docking simulations suggested
that two amino acid residues, Val-114 and Leu-367, affect the activity of
marCYP2B6. In fact, a marCYP2B6 mutant with substitutions V114I and L367V
exhibited BUP hydroxylase activity that was 4-fold higher than that of humCYP2B6,
while its EFV 8-hydroxylase activity was only 10% that of the human enzyme. These
results indicate that the amino acids at positions 114 and 367 affect the
enzymatic capacity of marmoset CYP2B6.

Human Herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) is a ubiquitous virus with an estimated
seroprevalence of 95% in the adult population. HHV-6 is associated with several
neurologic disorders, including multiple sclerosis, an inflammatory demyelinating
disease affecting the CNS. Animal models of HHV-6 infection would help clarify
its role in human disease but have been slow to develop because rodents lack
CD46, the receptor for cellular entry. Therefore, we investigated the effects of 
HHV-6 infections in a non-human primate, the common marmoset Callithrix jacchus. 
We inoculated a total of 12 marmosets with HHV-6A and HHV-6B intravenously and
HHV-6A intranasally. Animals were monitored for 25 weeks post-inoculation
clinically, immunologically and by MRI. Marmosets inoculated with HHV-6A
intravenously exhibited neurologic symptoms and generated virus-specific antibody
responses, while those inoculated intravenously with HHV-6B were asymptomatic and
generated comparatively lower antibody responses. Viral DNA was detected at a low
frequency in paraffin-embedded CNS tissue of a subset of marmosets inoculated
with HHV-6A and HHV-6B intravenously. When different routes of HHV-6A inoculation
were compared, intravenous inoculation resulted in virus-specific antibody
responses and infrequent detection of viral DNA in the periphery, while
intranasal inoculation resulted in negligible virus-specific antibody responses
and frequent detection of viral DNA in the periphery. Moreover, marmosets
inoculated with HHV-6A intravenously exhibited neurologic symptoms, while
marmosets inoculated with HHV-6A intranasally were asymptomatic. We demonstrate
that a marmoset model of HHV-6 infection can serve to further define the
contribution of this ubiquitous virus to human neurologic disorders.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an adult onset neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by the death of upper and lower motor neurons. About 10% of all ALS
cases are familial; approximately 20% of familial ALS cases are caused by
mutations in the superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) gene. We developed rats that
express a human SOD1 transgene with ALS-associated mutations, developing striking
motor neuron degeneration and paralysis. The larger size of this rat model as
compared with the ALS mice, will facilitate studies involving manipulations of
spinal fluid and the spinal cord. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is one of the
most potent survival-promoting factors for motor neurons. We administered human
recombinant HGF (hrHGF) by continuous intrathecal delivery to the transgenic rats
at the onset of paralysis for 4 weeks. Intrathecal administration of hrHGF
attenuated motor neuron degeneration and prolonged the duration of the disease by
63%. To translate this strategy to human treatment, we induced a contusive
cervical spinal cord injury in the common marmoset, a primate, and then
administered hrHGF intrathecally. The intrathecal administration of hrHGF
promoted functional recovery. These results prompted further clinical trials in
ALS using continuous intrathecal administration of hrHGF.

organotypic tissue culture of adult marmoset monkey retina.

The mammalian retina has more diversity of neurons than scientists had once
believed in order to establish complicated vision processing. In the monkey
retina, morphological diversity of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) besides dominant
midget and parasol cells has been suggested. However, characteristic subtypes of 
RGCs in other species such as bistratified direction-selective ganglion cells
(DSGC) have not yet been identified. Increasing interest has been shown in the
common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) monkey as a "super-model" of neuroscientific
research. Here, we established organotypic tissue culture of the adult marmoset
monkey retina with particle-mediated gene transfer of GFP to survey the
morphological diversity of RGCs. We successfully incubated adult marmoset monkey 
retinas for 2 to 4 days ex vivo for transient expression of GFP. We
morphologically examined 121 RGCs out of more than 3240 GFP-transfected cells in 
5 retinas. Among them, we identified monostratified or broadly stratified
ganglion cells (midget, parasol, sparse, recursive, thorny, and broad thorny
ganglion cells), and bistratified ganglion cells (recursive, large, and small
bistratified ganglion cells [blue-ON/yellow-OFF-like]). By this survey, we also
found a candidate for bistratified DSGC whose dendrites were well cofasciculated 
with ChAT-positive starburst dendrites, costratified with ON and OFF ChAT bands, 
and had honeycomb-shaped dendritic arbors morphologically similar to those in
rabbits. Our genetic engineering method provides a new approach to future
investigation for morphological and functional diversity of RGCs in the monkey
retina.

Murine and human iPSC-NS/PCs (induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neural
stem/progenitor cells) promote functional recovery following transplantation into
the injured spinal cord in rodents. However, for clinical applicability, it is
critical to obtain proof of the concept regarding the efficacy of grafted human
iPSC-NS/PCs (hiPSC-NS/PCs) for the repair of spinal cord injury (SCI) in a
non-human primate model. This study used a pre-evaluated "safe" hiPSC-NS/PC clone
and an adult common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) model of contusive SCI. SCI was
induced at the fifth cervical level (C5), followed by transplantation of
hiPSC-NS/PCs at 9 days after injury. Behavioral analyses were performed from the 
time of the initial injury until 12 weeks after SCI. Grafted hiPSC-NS/PCs
survived and differentiated into all three neural lineages. Furthermore,
transplantation of hiPSC-NS/PCs enhanced axonal sparing/regrowth and
angiogenesis, and prevented the demyelination after SCI compared with that in
vehicle control animals. Notably, no tumor formation occurred for at least 12
weeks after transplantation. Quantitative RT-PCR showed that mRNA expression
levels of human neurotrophic factors were significantly higher in cultured
hiPSC-NS/PCs than in human dermal fibroblasts (hDFs). Finally, behavioral tests
showed that hiPSC-NS/PCs promoted functional recovery after SCI in the common
marmoset. Taken together, these results indicate that pre-evaluated safe
hiPSC-NS/PCs are a potential source of cells for the treatment of SCI in the
clinic.

While much is known about adult obesity in nonhuman primates, very little is
known regarding development of childhood adiposity. As small monkeys that are
easy to handle and have a relatively fast life history, common marmoset monkeys
(Callithrix jacchus) offer interesting opportunities to examine the question of
fat versus lean mass growth in a nonhuman primate. This article provides an
overview of our understanding of early life growth in mass in marmoset monkeys,
based primarily upon our past 20 years of research, culminating in our recent
findings on early life obesity in this species. Common marmosets display variance
in early life growth patterns that is related to both pre- and postnatal factors 
and the marmoset uterine environment is exquisitely designed to reflect resources
available for the gestation of multiple offspring, making them an interesting
model of developmental programming. We have demonstrated that obesity can be
generated in very early life in captive marmosets, with excess adiposity evident 
by one month of age, making this species a potentially valuable model in which to
study pediatric obesity and its sequelae. Birth weight is associated with
adiposity in animals vulnerable to obesity. Early life exposure to higher fat
diets enhances the chances of postweaning obesity development. However, overall
higher food consumption is also associated with obesity development at later
ages. One unexpected finding in our studies has been the relatively high body fat
percentage of neonatal (12-18%) marmosets suggesting that hypotheses regarding
the uniqueness of high human neonatal adiposity merit further examination.

Common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) developed high levels of viremia, clinical 
signs including fever, weight loss, a decrease in activity and hematuria upon
inoculation with dengue virus (DENV). Presence of DENV genome in urine samples
and pathological changes in kidneys were examined in the present study. Levels of
DENV genome were determined in 228 urine samples from 20 primary DENV-inoculated 
marmosets and in 56 urine samples from four secondary DENV-inoculated marmosets. 
DENV genome was detected in 75% (15/20) of marmosets after primary DENV
infection. No DENV genome was detected in urine samples from the marmosets with
secondary infection with homologous DENV (0%, 0/4). Two marmosets demonstrated
hematuria. Pathological analysis of the kidneys demonstrated non-suppressive
interstitial nephritis with renal tubular regeneration. DENV antigen-positive
cells were detected in kidneys. In human dengue virus infections, some patients
present renal symptoms. The results indicate that marmosets recapitulate some
aspects of the involvement of kidneys in human DENV infection, and suggest that
marmosets are potentially useful for the studies of the pathogenesis of DENV
infection, including kidneys.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is amply distributed in the Brazilian
Northeast, but little is known of its ecology in the semi-arid Caatinga
scrublands. The present study provides the first detailed data on the composition
of the diet of C. jacchus in Caatinga ecosystems, derived from observations at
four sites in the state of Sergipe. While exudate sources were gouged at all four
sites in a manner typical of the species, fruit was the principal component of
the diet at the main study site during most months, and a number of unusual items
were eaten, including leaves, and the reproductive parts of cacti and bromeliads.
These plants are rarely recorded in marmoset diets, but are common in caatinga
habitats. Leaves were ingested during 5 of the 8 months monitored at the main
study site, reaching 39.74% of the diet in 1 month, and appeared to be an
alternative fallback food to plant exudates during periods when fruit was scarce.
Three species of cactus provided both flowers and fruits, while the terrestrial
bromeliad, Encholirium spectabile, provided nectar (30.81% of the diet in
November). Approximately half of the plant species (and three families)
identified in this study had not been recorded previously in the diet of
Callithrix. Overall, the data suggest that, while the marmosets exploit the same 
types of plant foods in the Caatinga, the resource base is quite distinct from
that of the Atlantic Forest. Other differences, such as relatively small groups
and large home ranges, may contribute to divergent ecological patterns, which
require more systematic investigation. Am. J. Primatol. 75:333-341, 2013. © 2012

Regenerative medicine is in need of solid, large animal models as a link between 
rodents and humans to evaluate the functionality, immunogenicity, and clinical
safety of stem cell-derived cell types. The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) 
is an excellent large animal model, genetically close to humans and readily used 
worldwide in clinical research. Until now, only two groups showed the generation 
of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from the common marmoset using
integrating retroviral vectors. Therefore, we reprogrammed bone marrow-derived
mesenchymal cells (MSCs) of adult marmosets in the presence of TAV, SB431542,
PD0325901, and ascorbic acid via a novel, excisable lentiviral spleen
focus-forming virus (SFFV)-driven quad-cistronic vector system (OCT3/4, KLF4,
SOX2, C-MYC). Endogenous pluripotency markers like OCT3/4, KLF4, SOX2, C-MYC,
LIN28, NANOG, and strong alkaline phosphatase signals were detected. Exogenous
genes were silenced and additionally the cassette was removed with a retroviral
Gag precursor system. The cell line could be cultured in absence of leukemia
inhibitory factor (LIF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and could be
successfully differentiated into embryoid bodies and teratomas with presence of
all three germ layers. Directed differentiation generated neural progenitors,
megakaryocytes, adipocytes, chondrocytes, and osteogenic cells. Thus, all
criteria for fully reprogrammed bone marrow-MSCs of a nonhuman primate with a
genetically sophisticated construct could be demonstrated. These cells will be a 
promising tool for future autologous transplantations.

Tracking blue cone signals in the primate brain.

Author information:

University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.

In this paper, we review the path taken by signals originating from the short
wavelength sensitive cones (S-cones) in Old World and New World primates. Two
types of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) carrying S-cone signals (blue-On and
blue-Off cells) project to the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) in the
thalamus. In all primates, these S-cone signals are relayed through the
'dust-like' (konis in classical Greek) dLGN cells. In New World primates such as 
common marmoset, these very small cells are known to form distinct and spatially 
extensive, koniocellular layers. Although in Old World primates, such as
macaques, koniocellular layers tend to be very thin, the adjacent parvocellular
layers contain distinct koniocellular extensions. It appears that all S-cone
signals are relayed through such konio cells, whether they are in the main
koniocellular layers or in their colonies within the parvocellular layers of the 
dLGN. In the primary visual cortex, these signals begin to merge with the signals
carried by the other two principal parallel channels, namely the magnocellular
and parvocellular channels. This article will also review the possible routes
taken by the S-cone signals to reach one of the topographically organised
extrastriate visual cortical areas, the middle temporal area (area MT). This area
is the major conduit for signals reaching the parietal cortex. Alternative visual
inputs to area MT not relayed via the primary visual cortex area (V1) may provide
the neurological basis for the phenomenon of 'blindsight' observed in human and
non-human primates, who have partial or complete damage to the primary visual
cortex. Short wavelength sensitive cone (S-cone) signals to area MT may also play
a role in directing visual attention with possible implications for understanding
the pathology in dyslexia and some of its treatment options.

Digestive efficiency mediated by serum calcium predicts bone mineral density in
the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).

Two health problems have plagued captive common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus)
colonies for nearly as long as those colonies have existed: marmoset wasting
syndrome and metabolic bone disease. While marmoset wasting syndrome is
explicitly linked to nutrient malabsorption, we propose metabolic bone disease is
also linked to nutrient malabsorption, although indirectly. If animals experience
negative nutrient balance chronically, critical nutrients may be taken from
mineral stores such as the skeleton, thus leaving those stores depleted. We
indirectly tested this prediction through an initial investigation of digestive
efficiency, as measured by apparent energy digestibility, and serum parameters
known to play a part in metabolic bone mineral density of captive common marmoset
monkeys. In our initial study on 12 clinically healthy animals, we found a wide
range of digestive efficiencies, and subjects with lower digestive efficiency had
lower serum vitamin D despite having higher food intakes. A second experiment on 
23 subjects including several with suspected bone disease was undertaken to
measure digestive and serum parameters, with the addition of a measure of bone
mineral density by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Bone mineral density 
was positively associated with apparent digestibility of energy, vitamin D, and
serum calcium. Further, digestive efficiency was found to predict bone mineral
density when mediated by serum calcium. These data indicate that a poor ability
to digest and absorb nutrients leads to calcium and vitamin D insufficiency.
Vitamin D absorption may be particularly critical for indoor-housed animals, as
opposed to animals in a more natural setting, because vitamin D that would
otherwise be synthesized via exposure to sunlight must be absorbed from their
diet. If malabsorption persists, metabolic bone disease is a possible consequence
in common marmosets. These findings support our hypothesis that both wasting
syndrome and metabolic bone disease in captive common marmosets are consequences 
of inefficient nutrient absorption.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a small New World primate that has
been used as a non-human primate model for various biomedical studies. We
previously demonstrated that transplantation of neural stem/progenitor cells
(NS/PCs) derived from mouse and human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced
pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) promote functional locomotor recovery of mouse
spinal cord injury models. However, for the clinical application of such a
therapeutic approach, we need to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pluripotent 
stem cell-derived NS/PCs not only by xenotransplantation, but also
allotransplantation using non-human primate models to assess immunological
rejection and tumorigenicity. In the present study, we established a culture
method to efficiently derive NS/PCs as neurospheres from common marmoset ESCs.
Marmoset ESC-derived neurospheres could be passaged repeatedly and showed
sequential generation of neurons and astrocytes, similar to that of mouse
ESC-derived NS/PCs, and gave rise to functional neurons as indicated by calcium
imaging. Although marmoset ESC-derived NS/PCs could not differentiate into
oligodendrocytes under default culture conditions, these cells could abundantly
generate oligodendrocytes by incorporating additional signals that recapitulate
in vivo neural development. Moreover, principal component analysis of microarray 
data demonstrated that marmoset ESC-derived NS/PCs acquired similar gene
expression profiles to those of fetal brain-derived NS/PCs by repeated passaging.
Therefore, marmoset ESC-derived NS/PCs may be useful not only for accurate
evaluation by allotransplantation of NS/PCs into non-human primate models, but
are also applicable to analysis of iPSCs established from transgenic disease
model marmosets.

Dual-pitch processing mechanisms in primate auditory cortex.

Pitch, our perception of how high or low a sound is on a musical scale, is a
fundamental perceptual attribute of sounds and is important for both music and
speech. After more than a century of research, the exact mechanisms used by the
auditory system to extract pitch are still being debated. Theoretically, pitch
can be computed using either spectral or temporal acoustic features of a sound.
We have investigated how cues derived from the temporal envelope and spectrum of 
an acoustic signal are used for pitch extraction in the common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus), a vocal primate species, by measuring pitch discrimination 
behaviorally and examining pitch-selective neuronal responses in auditory cortex.
We find that pitch is extracted by marmosets using temporal envelope cues for
lower pitch sounds composed of higher-order harmonics, whereas spectral cues are 
used for higher pitch sounds with lower-order harmonics. Our data support
dual-pitch processing mechanisms, originally proposed by psychophysicists based
on human studies, whereby pitch is extracted using a combination of temporal
envelope and spectral cues.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a small New World primate that has
increasingly been used as a non-human model in the fields of sensory, motor, and 
cognitive neuroscience. However, little knowledge exists regarding behavioral
methods in this species. Developing an understanding of the neural basis of
perception and cognition in an animal model requires measurement of both brain
activity and behavior. Here we describe an operant conditioning behavioral
training method developed to allow controlled psychoacoustic measurements in
marmosets. We demonstrate that marmosets can be trained to consistently perform a
Go/No-Go auditory task in which a subject licks at a feeding tube when it detects
a sound. Correct responses result in delivery of a food reward. Crucially, this
operant conditioning task generates little body movement and is well suited for
pairing behavior with single-unit electrophysiology. Successful implementation of
an operant conditioning behavior opens the door to a wide range of new studies in
the field of auditory neuroscience using the marmoset as a model system.

There has been a recent resurgence of interest in New World monkeys within the
biomedical research community, driven by both the sequencing of the common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) genome and a growing demand for alternatives to Old
World primates. New World monkeys offer attractive advantages over Old World
species, including cheaper and simpler husbandry, while still maintaining a
greater evolutionary proximity to humans compared with other animal models.
Although numerous commonalities across primate species exist, there are also
important genetic and reproductive differences that can and should play a
critical role in selecting appropriate animal models. Common marmosets in
particular have significantly reduced diversity at the major histocompatibility
complex (MHC) loci and are born as hematopoietic chimeras. New World primates can
make ideal translational models for research, but scientists must necessarily
incorporate complete understandings of their genetic and phenotypic differences
from humans and other model organisms.

BACKGROUND: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) measurement was applied to the
brain of the common marmoset, a small primate species, treated with
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). The marmoset shows prominent
Parkinson's disease (PD) signs due to dopaminergic neural degeneration. Recently,
the transgenic marmoset (TG) carrying human PD genes is developing. For
phenotypic evaluations of TG, non-invasive PET measurement is considered to be
substantially significant. As a reference control for TG, the brain of the
MPTP-marmoset as an established and valid model was scanned by PET. Behavioral
analysis was also performed by recording locomotion of the MPTP-marmoset, as an
objective measure of PD signs.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: MARMOSETS RECEIVED SEVERAL MPTP REGIMENS (SINGLE 
MPTP REGIMEN: 2 mg/kg, s.c., per day for 3 consecutive days) were used for PET
measurement and behavioral observation. To measure immobility as a central PD
sign, locomotion of marmosets in their individual living cages were recorded
daily by infrared sensors. Daily locomotion counts decreased drastically after
MPTP regimens and remained diminished for several months or more. PET scan of the
brain, using [(11)C]PE2I as a ligand of the dopamine (DA) transporter, was
performed once several months after the last MPTP regimen. The mean binding
potential (BP(ND)) in the striatum (putamen and caudate) of the MPTP-marmoset
group was significantly lower than that of the MPTP-free control group (n=5 for
each group). In the MPTP-marmosets, the decrease of BP(ND) in the striatum
closely correlated with the decrease in locomotion counts (r=0.98 in putamen and 
0.91 in caudate).
CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: The present characterization of neural degeneration
using non-invasive PET imaging and of behavioral manifestation in the MPTP
marmoset mimics typical PD characteristics and can be useful in evaluating the
phenotype of TG marmosets being developed.

The developmental anatomy of the brain is largely directed by neural-based cues. 
Despite this knowledge, the developmental trajectory of the primate brain has not
yet been fully characterized. To realize this goal, the advance in noninvasive
imaging methods and new brain atlases are essential. The common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus), a small New World primate, is widely used in neuroscience
research. The recent introduction of transgenic techniques has enabled the
marmoset to be used as a genetically modifiable primate model for brain
development. Here, a magnetic resonance histology technique involving the use of 
ultra-high-resolution ex vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed to
identify the developmental anatomy of the marmoset brain at different time points
from gestational week 8 through to birth. The data allowed the generation of a
multidimensional atlas of brain structures at different developmental stages.
Furthermore, in utero MRI techniques were developed to noninvasively monitor
brain development during the embryonic and fetal stages. The multidimensional
atlas and the MRI tools developed herein are anticipated to further our
understanding of the developing primate brain.

The monoamine re-uptake inhibitor UWA-101 improves motor fluctuations in the
MPTP-lesioned common marmoset.

Ontario, Canada.

BACKGROUND: The wearing-OFF phenomenon is a common motor complication of chronic 
L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) therapy for Parkinson's disease. We
recently described the discovery of UWA-101, a dual serotonin (SERT) and dopamine
(DAT) transporter inhibitor, which increases the duration of "good quality"
ON-time provided by L-DOPA in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine
(MPTP)-lesioned primate. Here, we further characterise the effects of UWA-101 on 
this extension of ON-time in terms of L-DOPA-induced side-effects in the
MPTP-lesioned common marmoset.
METHODS: Marmosets were rendered parkinsonian by MPTP injection and "primed" by
repeated L-DOPA administration, to exhibit dyskinesia and psychosis-like
behaviours. Animals were then administered acute challenges of L-DOPA in
combination with UWA-101 (1, 3, 6 and 10 mg/kg) or vehicle.
RESULTS: In combination with L-DOPA, UWA-101 (3, 6 and 10 mg/kg) significantly
increased duration of ON-time (by 28%, 28%, and 33%, respectively; all P<0.05).
UWA-101 (10 mg/kg) significantly extended duration of ON-time without disabling
dyskinesia (by 62%, P<0.01). UWA-101 did not exacerbate the severity of
dyskinesia (P>0.05). However, at the highest doses (6 and 10 mg/kg), UWA-101
increased the severity of psychosis-like behaviours (P<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that dual SERT/ DAT inhibitors can
effectively enhance L-DOPA anti-parkinsonian action, without exacerbating
dyskinesia and, as such, represent a promising new therapeutic class for
wearing-OFF. However, at higher doses, dual SERT/ DAT inhibitors may exacerbate
dopaminergic psychosis.

We have developed a multi variate analysis of social communication behavior which
allows for discriminating the emotional state of an agent interacting with other 
agents (Bouquet method). Domestic chick or common marmoset was reared under
socially isolated conditions, later tested for its development of communication
behavior with peers by Bouquet, and compared with that of animals reared under
grouping conditions. We found the existence of high sensitive period for social
interaction, given less experience, developing less affiliated behavior. From
chick model, a couple of neuronal difference was observed between two groups,
amygdale core central cell size, MRI volumetric measure in mesolimbic area, and
gene expression patter including brain type tryptophan hydroxylase in nucleus
accumbens. The isolated chick behavior changed better to be socially affiliated
by taking SSRI/SNRI or Ubiquinol (the reduced form of CoQ10) together with social
interaction experience after the sensitive period. Finally, we could discriminate
the behavior of Asperger syndrome children (n = 7) from that of the typically
developed siblings (n = 6) during the clinical interview by applying Bouquet
method.

We have been investigating the relevance and availability of 5/6 nephrectomized
(Nx) common marmoset monkeys (Callithrix jacchus) as a chronic renal failure
model. As a part of this investigation, renal glomerular changes in the Nx
marmosets were histopathologically and immunohistochemically evaluated, and then 
compared with those in 5/6 Nx SD rats. In the Nx marmosets, the blood and urine
parameters were elevated, excluding urine protein; histopathologically,
enlargement of Bowman's capsule and atrophy of the glomeruli were observed in all
animals, and other slight changes were also observed in 1 or 2 marmosets. There
were no significant changes in the mesangial matrix injury score, vimentin and
desmin positivity or the number of WT1 positive cells between the control and Nx 
marmoset groups. On the other hand, in the Nx rats, the blood and urine
parameters were elevated; histopathologically, various changes were observed in
the glomeruli, and the mesangial matrix injury score, vimentin and desmin
positivity were increased, while the number of WT1 positive cells was decreased; 
these histopathological impacts on the renal glomerulus at 13 weeks after Nx in
rats were more severe than that in the Nx marmosets. Because the glomerular
basement membrane (GBM) was much thicker in the marmosets than in the rats in
electron microscopy, the weaker pathological changes in the Nx marmosets might be
due to the GBM thickness. This study showed for the first time glomerular lesions
developed in the Nx marmosets, and the possible pathogenesis of the glomerular
lesions was discussed.

Adeno-associated virus (AAV) is a non-pathogenic human parvovirus that can infect
both non-proliferating and proliferating cells. Owing to its favorable safety
profile, AAV is regarded as suitable for clinical purposes such as gene therapy. 
The target cell types of AAV depend largely on the serotype. In the retina, AAV
has been used to introduce exogenous genes into photoreceptors, and
photoreceptor-specific enhancers/promoters are used in most cases. Therefore,
serotype specificity of AAV in retinal subtypes is unclear, particularly in
vitro. We compared its infection profile in mouse and monkey retinas using EGFP
under the control of the CAG promoter, which expressed the gene ubiquitously and 
strongly regardless of cell type. AAV1, 8, and 9 infected the horizontal cells
when an embryonic day-17 retina was used as a host. Amacrine cell was also a
major target of AAVs, and a small number of rod photoreceptors were infected.
When adult retinas were used as a host, the main target of AAV was Müller glia. A
small number of rod photoreceptors were also infected. In the adult common
marmoset retina, rod and cone photoreceptors were efficiently infected by AAV1,
8, and 9. A portion of the Müller glia and amacrine cells were also infected. In 
summary, the infection specificity of different AAV serotypes did not differ, but
was dependent on the stage of the host retina. In addition, infection
specificities differed between mature marmoset retinas and mature mouse retinas.

The amygdala plays an important role in the processing of emotional events. This 
information processing is altered by development, but little is known about the
development of electrophysiological properties of neurons in the amygdala. We
studied the postnatal development of electrophysiological properties of neurons
in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).
Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were obtained from BLA pyramidal neurons in
brain slices prepared from developing and adult marmosets, and
electrophysiological properties known to change during development in rats were
analysed. Two passive electrical properties of the neuronal membrane - the input 
resistance (R(in)) and the membrane time constant () - significantly decreased
with postnatal development. In contrast, the action potential only showed a
slight decrease in duration during the first month of life, whereas the amplitude
did not change after birth. Passive electrical properties and action potentials
in neurons of 4-week-old marmosets were similar to those in neurons of 4-year-old
marmosets. The development of the action potential duration was not correlated
with the development of R(in) or , whereas the development of R(in) and was
correlated with each other. Abundant spontaneous and noradrenaline-induced
GABAergic currents were present immediately after birth and did not change during
postnatal development. These results suggest that newborn infant marmoset BLA
pyramidal neurons possess relatively mature action potentials and receive
vigorous GABAergic synaptic inputs, and that they acquire adult-like
electrophysiological properties by the fourth week of life.

False-positive antibody signals for the pluripotency factor OCT4A (POU5F1) in
testis-derived cells may lead to erroneous data and misinterpretations.

Octamer-binding protein 4 (OCT4) is a key player in pluripotent embryonic stem
(ES) cells and is essential for the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells.
Recently, several reports indicated the spontaneous recovery of pluripotency in
cultured adult human testis-derived cells. This was evidenced also by the
detection of OCT4 using antibodies. However, the soundness of some data was
recently put into question. During our attempts to derive pluripotent cells from 
the common marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus) testis, we obtained inconsistent 
data which prompted us to analyze deeper the characteristics of three independent
OCT4 antibodies that were used in numerous published studies that received
greatest attention. All antibodies detected OCT4 by immunofluorescence (IF) in a 
marmoset monkey ES cell line. Two of the three OCT4 antibodies also gave robust
nuclear signals in testis-derived cells. However, the latter cells expressed no
OCT4 mRNA as revealed by quantitative RT-PCR and turned out to be mesenchymal
cells. When tested in western blot analyses, all antibodies detected
heterologously expressed marmoset monkey OCT4 protein. But, importantly, those
antibodies that resulted in non-specific signals in IF also showed additional
non-specific bands in western blots. In summary, some commercially available OCT4
antibodies result in false-positive signals which may provoke erroneous
conclusions when used in studies aiming at the generation of pluripotent cells in
vitro. We conclude that (i) antibodies must be carefully characterized before use
to prevent misleading observations and (ii) OCT4 expression must be monitored by 
a second antibody-independent method.

Optimization of oocyte culture conditions is a crucial aspect of reproductive
biology and technology. In the present study, maturation of germinal
vesicle-stage marmoset oocytes were evaluated in the following media: Waymouth
medium, Waymouth medium containing porcine follicular fluid (pFF) (Waymouth-pFF
medium), and porcine oocyte medium (POM). Oocytes cultured in Waymouth-pFF medium
had higher maturation rates to the metaphase II stage than those cultured in
Waymouth medium (36.1% vs. 24.8%, respectively, P < 0.05), indicating the
suitability of this medium for culturing marmoset oocytes. Hence, maturation of
marmoset oocytes cultured in POM was subsequently evaluated. The rate of
maturation to the metaphase I stage was significantly higher and degradation
rates were significantly lower in oocytes cultured in POM than those cultured in 
Waymouth medium. In addition, three offspring were successfully obtained after
transfer of embryos matured in chemically defined medium. Therefore, we concluded
that POM was suitable for marmoset oocyte culture. Furthermore, this was
apparently the first report of marmoset offspring derived from oocytes cultured
in chemically defined medium.

PURPOSE: We evaluated the effect of imposing negative and positive defocus
simultaneously on the eye growth and refractive state of the common marmoset, a
New World primate that compensates for either negative and positive defocus when 
they are imposed individually.
METHODS: Ten marmosets were reared with multizone contact lenses of alternating
powers (-5 diopters [D]/+5 D), 50:50 ratio for average pupil of 2.80 mm over the 
right eye (experimental) and plano over the fellow eye (control) from 10 to 12
weeks. The effects on refraction (mean spherical equivalent [MSE]) and vitreous
chamber depth (VC) were measured and compared to untreated, and -5 D and +5 D
single vision contact lens-reared marmosets.
RESULTS: Over the course of the treatment, pupil diameters ranged from 2.26 to
2.76 mm, leading to 1.5 times greater exposure to negative than positive power
zones. Despite this, at different intervals during treatment, treated eyes were
on average relatively more hyperopic and smaller than controls
(experimental-control [exp-con] mean MSE ± SE +1.44 ± 0.45 D, mean VC ± SE -0.05 
± 0.02 mm) and the effects were similar to those in marmosets raised on +5 D
single vision contact lenses (exp-con mean MSE ± SE +1.62 ± 0.44 D. mean VC ± SE 
-0.06 ± 0.03 mm). Six weeks into treatment, the interocular growth rates in
multizone animals were already lower than in -5 D-treated animals (multizone -1.0
± 0.1 μm/day, -5 D +2.1 ± 0.9 μm/day) and did not change significantly throughout
treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Imposing hyperopic and myopic defocus simultaneously using
concentric contact lenses resulted in relatively smaller and less myopic eyes,
despite treated eyes being exposed to a greater percentage of negative defocus.
Exposing the retina to combined dioptric powers with multifocal lenses that
include positive defocus might be an effective treatment to control myopia
development or progression.

Pluripotent stem cells can provide us with an enormous cell source for in vitro
model systems for development. In 2006, new methodology was designed to generate 
pluripotent stem cells directly from somatic cells, and these cells were named
induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). This method consists of technically
simple procedures: donor cell preparation, gene transduction, and isolation of
embryonic stem cell-like colonies. The iPSC technology enables cell biologists
not only to obtain pluripotent stem cells easily but also to study the
reprogramming events themselves. Here, we describe the protocols to generate
iPSCs from somatic origins by using conventional viral vectors. Specifically, we 
state the usage of three mammalian species: mouse, common marmoset, and human. As
mouse iPSC donors, fibroblasts are easily prepared, while mesenchymal stem cells 
are expected to give rise to highly reprogrammed iPSCs efficiently. Common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a nonhuman primate, represents an alternative
model to the usual laboratory animals. Finally, patient-specific human iPSCs give
us an opportunity to examine the pathology and mechanisms of dysregulated genomic
imprinting. The iPSC technology will serve as a valuable method for studying
genomic imprinting, and conversely, the insights from these studies will offer
valuable criteria to assess the potential of iPSCs.

BACKGROUND: l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA)-induced dyskinesia (LID) are a 
complication of chronic dopamine replacement therapy in Parkinson's disease (PD).
Recent studies have suggested that the mechanisms underlying development and
expression of LID in PD may involve epigenetic changes that include deacetylation
of striatal histone proteins. We hypothesised that inhibition of histone
deacetylase, the enzyme responsible of histone deacetylation, would alleviate
LID.
METHODS: Four female common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) were rendered
parkinsonian by administration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine
(MPTP). Following stabilisation of the parkinsonian phenotype, marmosets were
primed to exhibit dyskinesia with chronic administration of L-DOPA. We then
investigated the effects of the brain-penetrant histone deacetylase inhibitor,
RGFP109 (30 mg/kg p.o. once daily for 6 days), on LID and L-DOPA
anti-parkinsonian efficacy.
RESULTS: RGFP109 had no acute effects on dyskinesia after single or 6 days
once-daily treatment (both P > 0.05). However, one week following cessation of
RGFP109, dyskinesia and duration of ON-time with disabling dyskinesia were
reduced by 37% and 50%, respectively (both P < 0.05), compared to that seen
previously with L-DOPA alone. There was no change in anti-parkinsonian actions
of, or ON-time duration afforded by, L-DOPA (P > 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Histone deacetylation inhibition may represent a novel approach to
reverse established LID in PD and improve quality of the anti-parkinsonian
benefit provided by L-DOPA.

Social effects via olfactory sensory stimuli on reproductive function and
dysfunction in cooperative breeding marmosets and tamarins.

Most primates are social species whose reproduction is influenced by their social
relationships. The cotton-top tamarin, Saguinus oedipus, and the common marmoset,
Callithrix jacchus, are cooperative breeding species where the family structure
alters reproductive function in many ways. While primates receive social effects 
on reproduction via all sensory stimuli, the marmosets and tamarins are
particularly influenced by olfactory/chemosensory stimuli. The olfactory sensory 
processing is the "social glue" that keeps the family together. This review
describes a number of studies using the marmosets and tamarins at the University 
of Wisconsin to demonstrate how odor cues are used for altering reproductive
function and dysfunction. Several key studies will be discussed to show the role 
of odor signaling of the female reproductive state. The suppressive effects of
odors are mediated by priming odors and can cause a suppressive influence on
ovulation in young females via their mother's scents. Additionally, odor cues
from the infant function as priming odors to ensure that fathers and mothers are 
present and receptive to their parental care duties. Neural pathways occur via
the processing of priming odors that consequently stimulate alterations in the
behavioral and endocrine response to the stimuli. The dynamics of the cooperative
breeding system ensure that offspring have essential needs met and that they
develop in a family environment. Olfactory communication plays a key role in
maintenance of the social system of Callitrichid monkeys.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a small New World primate, has been
attracting much attention in the research field of biomedical science and
neuroscience, based on its (i) cross-reactivity with human cytokines or hormones,
(ii) comparative ease in handling due to its small size, (iii) high reproductive 
efficiency, (iv) establishment of basic research tools, and (v) advantages of its
unique behavioral and cognitive characters. Various neurological disease models
have been developed in the common marmoset, including Parkinson's disease,
Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, stroke, multiple sclerosis and spinal 
cord injury. We recently developed transgenic common marmoset with germline
transmission, which is expected to provide a new animal model for the study of
human diseases. In this review, we summarize the recent progress of biomedical
research and neuroscience using common marmoset as an excellent model system.

B lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS, also indicated as BAFF (B-cell activating factor) 
and CD257), and A Proliferation Inducing Ligand (APRIL, CD256) are two members of
the TNF superfamily with a central role in B cell survival. Antibodies against
these factors have potential therapeutic relevance in autoimmune inflammatory
disorders with a proven pathogenic contribution of B cells, such as multiple
sclerosis (MS). In the current study we performed a multi-parameter efficacy
comparison of monoclonal antibodies against human anti-BLyS and anti-APRIL in a
common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) model of experimental autoimmune
encephalomyelitis (EAE). A MS-like disease was induced by immunization with
recombinant human myelin/oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (rhMOG) in complete
Freund's adjuvant. The results show that the anti-BLyS and anti-APRIL antibody
cause significant depletion of circulating CD20+ B cells, but a small subset of
CD20 + CD40(high) B cells was not depleted. Induction of CD20+ B cell depletion
from lymph nodes was only observed in the anti-BLyS treated monkeys. Both
antibodies had a significant inhibitory effect on disease development, but all
monkeys developed clinically evident EAE. Anti-BLyS treated monkeys were
sacrificed with the same clinical signs as saline-treated monkeys, but
nevertheless displayed significantly reduced spinal cord demyelination. This
effect was not observed in the anti-APRIL treated monkeys. The two antibodies had
a different effect on T cell subset activation and the profiles of ex vivo
released cytokines. In conclusion, treatment with anti-BLyS and anti-APRIL delays
the development of neurological disease in a relevant preclinical model of MS.
The two mAbs achieve this effect via different mechanisms.

Endocrine data and characteristics of nonconceptive ovarian cycling and pregnancy
are limited within the genus Callithrix to the common marmoset (C. jacchus) and
Wied's black tufted-ear marmoset (C. kuhlii). This article presents patterns of
urinary pregnanediol-3-glucuronide (PdG) excretion, as determined by enzyme
immunoassay, throughout the course of ovarian cycling and pregnancy in
white-faced marmosets (C. geoffroyi). Furthermore, characteristics of
reproductive parameters including litter size, duration of gestation, maternal
age, and information about ovarian cycling following administration of
contraceptives are also described. A steep increase in PdG, an indication of
ovulation, characterizes normative ovarian cycles, with peak-to-peak intervals
between cycles being 27.82 ± 1.49 days in length. PdG excretion (μg/mg Cr) across
pregnancy peaked during the 1st and 2nd trimesters (1st = 20.71 ± 2.98, 2nd =
21.16 ± 2.60) and declined gradually to near preconception levels over the 3rd
trimester until parturition (3rd = 5.74 ± 1.60). Gestation lasted 148.55 ± 1.89
days. Most pregnancies (82.8%) resulted in an immediate postpartum ovulation
(PPO) of 17.45 ± 2.22 days with 58.3% of PPOs resulting in conception. No
differences in PdG excretion during the 1st trimester between full pregnancies
and miscarriages were found, and pregnancy characteristics such as litter size,
duration of gestation, and maternal age were not associated with PdG
concentrations. Administration of cloprostenol resulted in shorter peak-to-peak
cycle durations, but ovulation was detectable with similar concentrations of peak
PdG to a normal nonconceptive cycle. Conversely, medroxyprogesterone acetate
(DMPA) injections resulted in little to no PdG excretion across the ovarian
cycle. Both methods of contraception providing effective prevention of
conception. Overall, these results show that strong similarities in reproductive 
parameters persist within the genus Callithrix and to a lesser extent across the 
Callitrichidae family.

The relationship between methylmercury (MeHg) exposure and aquaporin (AQP)
expression in the brain is currently unknown. To investigate this, we used a
common marmoset model of acute MeHg exposure to examine AQP1, AQP4 and AQP11 gene
expression. MeHg (1.5 mg Hg/kg/day p.o.) was given to three marmosets for 14
days, followed by 14 days without. All treated marmosets showed slight akinesia
before sacrifice. In the frontal lobe, occipital lobe and cerebellum, total
mercury concentrations following MeHg administration were 26.7, 31.4, and 22.6
µg/g, respectively. Slight apoptosis was observed in the occipital lobe.
Immunohistochemistry showed increased expression of glial fibrillary acidic
protein, its mRNA and Iba1 with MeHg, indicating that neuronal injury activated
astrocytes and microglia. There was no significant difference between control and
MeHg-administered groups in AQP1 protein or AQP11 mRNA in the frontal lobe,
occipital lobe or cerebellum. The ratio of AQP4 mRNA expression in
MeHg-administered marmosets to the mean AQR4 expression in the controls (n = 3)
were 1.3, 1.5 and 1.2, 1.7, 1.9 and 1.5, and 1.5, 1.6 and 1.2 for the frontal
lobe, occipital lobe and cerebellum, respectively. Western blotting showed
significantly increased AQP4 protein in the occipital lobe and cerebellum with
MeHg administration, but no obvious up-regulation in the frontal lobe.
Immunofluorescence analysis with double staining revealed low AQP4 expression in 
the cell body of reactive astrocytes in the MeHg-administered group. These
results indicate that AQP4 expression might be stimulated by MeHg exposure in
astrocytes in the occipital lobe and cerebellum, suggesting a role for AQP4 in
MeHg neurotoxicity via astrocyte dysfunction.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a species of New World monkeys.
Because of its ease of maintenance and breeding in laboratories, use of the
marmoset is growing rapidly in biomedical research. In neuroscience, the
marmosets are attracting more attention, since they have the developed cerebral
cortex which plays a key role in higher brain functions. In this review on
neuroscience research using the marmoset, experimental techniques developed in
our laboratory are summarized. We introduce artificial rearing of neonates,
stereotaxic surgery, neuroanatomy including virtual microscopy based on the
Internet technology, behavioral study using a large number of marmosets, and
primary neuron culture study.

The common marmoset, Callithrix jacchus, is one of the smallest primates and is
increasingly used for an experimental nonhuman primate model in many research
fields. Analysis of T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires is a powerful tool to
investigate T cell immunity in terms of antigen specificity and variability of
TCR expression. However, monoclonal antibodies specific for many TCR Vα or Vβ
chains have not been created. We have recently identified a large number of TCRα 
chain variable (TRAV) and TCRβ chain variable (TRBV) sequences from a cDNA
library of common marmosets. The purpose of this study is to develop a new method
for analysis of TCR repertoires in the common marmoset using this sequence
information. This method is based on a microplate hybridization technique using
32 TRAV-specific and 32 TRBV-specific oligoprobes following an adaptor-ligation
PCR. This enables the easy quantitation of the respective TRAV and TRBV
expression levels. No cross-hybridization among specific-oligoprobes and very low
variances in repeated measures of the same samples was found, demonstrating high 
specificity and reproducibility. Furthermore, this method was validated by an
antihuman Vβ23 antibody which specifically bound to marmoset Vβ23. Using this
method, we analyzed TCR repertoires from various tissue samples (PBMCs, spleen,
lymph node and thymus) and isolated T cell subpopulations (CD4+CD8+, CD4+CD8− and
CD4−CD8+) from the thymus of 10 common marmosets. Neither tissue-specific nor T
cell subpopulation-specific differences was found in TRAV and TRBV repertoires.
These results suggest that, unlike mice, TCR repertoires in the common marmoset
are not affected by endogenous superantigens and are conserved among individuals,
among tissues, and among T cell subpopulations. Thus, TCR repertoire analysis
with high specificity and reproducibility is a very useful technique, with the
potential to replace flow cytometric analysis using a panel of TRV-specific
antibodies, many of which remain unavailable.

Mast cells (MCs) are developed from hematopoietic progenitor cells and play an
important role in inflammation. Study of the kinetics of development and
accumulation of primate MC in vivo is crucial for the control of human
inflammatory diseases, as evolution of the immune system is quite rapid and
inflammation including MC response is considered to be different between mouse
and human. In the present study, we examined the development of MC from
hematopoietic progenitors of Callithrix jacchus (common marmoset), an
experimental animal of nonhuman primates. Bone marrow cells were fractionated for
the expression of CD34 and CD117 by cell sorting. MCs were developed in vitro or 
by transplanting the cells to NOD/SCID/IL-2γc knockout (NOG) mice. In vitro
culture of CD34(+)CD117(+) (double positive, DP) cells with stem cell factor
could generate high-affinity Fc epsilon receptor (FcεR)-expressing CD117(+) cells
with typical granules. The developed MC released β-hexosaminidase and produced
leukotriene C(4) after the stimulation of FcεRI. Transplantation of DP cells gave
rise to a marked expansion of CD34(-)CD45(+)CD117(+)FcεR(+) cells in NOG mice.
They expressed transcripts encoding chymase 1 and tryptase β. Differentiation of 
CD34(-)CD117(+) cells to MCs was relatively limited compared with the DP cells,
similarly to human MCs. These results suggest that this marmoset system provides 
a good model for human MC development.

Considerable progress has been made in small animal single photon emission
computed tomography (SPECT) imaging in the field of Parkinson's disease. In
preclinical research, there is an increasing demand for in vivo imaging
techniques to apply to animal models. Here, we report the first protocol for
dopamine transporter (DAT) SPECT in common marmosets using the radioligand
¹²³I-N-ω-fluoropropyl-2β-carbomethoxy-3β-{4-iodophenyl}nortropane (¹²³I-FP-CIT). 
Serial SPECT images were obtained on an upgraded clinical scanner to determine
the distribution kinetics of ¹²³I-FP-CIT in the marmoset brain. After intravenous
injection of approximately 60 MBq of the radiotracer ¹²³I-FP-CIT, stable and
specific striatal uptake was observed for at least 4h. Analysis of plasma samples
showed rapid disappearance of the radiotracer from blood plasma within a few
minutes after application, with activity declining to 4.1% of the administered
activity. Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 400 μm resolution
provided the details of the underlying anatomy. In a marmoset model of
Parkinson's disease, which was generated by unilateral injections of
6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) into the nigro-striatal projection pathway, complete
loss of striatal DAT binding in combination with behavioral deficits was
observed. The presented study demonstrates that ¹²³I-FP-CIT SPECT is a suitable
tool to investigate DAT integrity in preclinical studies on common marmosets.

B-cell depletion abrogates T cell-mediated demyelination in an
antibody-nondependent common marmoset experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis
model.

CD20-positive B-cell depletion is a highly promising treatment for multiple
sclerosis (MS), but the mechanisms underlying therapeutic effects are poorly
understood. B cells are thought to contribute to MS pathogenesis by producing
autoantibodies that amplify demyelination via opsonization of myelin. To analyze 
autoantibody-nondependent functions of B cells in an animal model of MS, we used 
a novel T cell-driven experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model in
marmoset monkeys (Callithrix jacchus). In this model, demyelination of brain and 
spinal cord white and gray matter and the ensuing neurological deficits are
induced by immunization with peptide 34 to 56 of myelin/oligodendrocyte
glycoprotein (MOG34-56) in incomplete Freund's adjuvant. Although autoantibodies 
do not have a detectable pathogeniccontribution in the model, depletion of B
cells with monoclonal antibody 7D8, a human IgG1κ monoclonal antibody against
human CD20, suppressed clinical and pathological EAE. In B cell-depleted monkeys,
the activation of peptide-specific Th17-producing and cytotoxic T cells, which in
previous studies were found to play an essential role in disease induction, was
impaired. Thus, we demonstrate a critical antibody-nondependent role for B cells 
in EAE, that is, the activation of pathogenic T cells.

A 32-month-old male common marmoset had a firm and white-colored mass in the
duodenal wall. The cut surface was smooth and grayish white in color.
Histologically, the mass consisted of a proliferation of spindle cells with an
oval to spindle-shaped nucleus and scant eosinophilic cytoplasm in a loose myxoid
or fibrotic background. Most of the lesion displayed no specific growth pattern
whereas some of the cells concentrated around the vessels and created an
onion-bulb structure. Additionally, marked inflammatory cellular infiltration,
mainly eosinophils, was observed throughout the lesion. Immunohistochemically,
the spindle cells were positive for vimentin, α-smooth muscle actin, fascin, and 
cyclin D1, and negative for S-100, factor VIII-related antigen, and c-kit. These 
histological and immunohistochemical features did not meet any differential
diagnoses such as gastrointestinal stromal tumor, inflammatory myofibroblastic
tumor, solitary fibrous tumor/hemangiopericytoma, smooth muscle tumor,
schwannoma, and hemangiosarcoma. Collectively, the authors diagnosed the mass as 
a lesion that corresponded to an inflammatory fibroid polyp (IFP) in humans. IFP 
is defined as a mesenchymal proliferation composed of spindle stromal cells,
small blood vessels, and inflammatory cells, particularly eosinophils, and is
currently classified as a nonneoplastic lesion. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first case of spontaneous IFP in nonhuman primates.

Nonhuman primates offer unique opportunities as animal models in the study of
developmental programming and the role of the placenta in developmental
processes. All primates share fundamental similarities in life history and
reproductive biology. Thus, insights gleaned from studies of nonhuman primates
have a higher degree of biological salience to human biology than do studies of
rodents or agricultural animals. The common marmoset monkey is a small-bodied
primate from South America that produces litters of dizygotic fetuses that share 
a single placental mass. This natural variation allows us to model different
intrauterine conditions and associated fetoplacental phenotypes. The marmoset
placenta is phenotypically plastic according to litter size. Triplet litters are 
characterized by low individual fetal weights and significantly more efficient
placentas and attendant alterations to the microscopic architecture and endocrine
function, thus modeling a nutrient restricted intrauterine environment.
Consistent with this model, triplet neonates experience a higher risk of
perinatal mortality and an increased likelihood of elevated adult weight. Recent 
evidence has shown that the intrauterine experience of females has an impact on
their own pregnancy outcomes in adulthood: triplet females experience
significantly greater pregnancy loss than do twin females. The marmoset monkey
thus represents a potential powerful nonhuman primate model of multiple
pregnancies, restrictive prenatal experiences, and differential reproductive
outcomes in adulthood, which may have important implications for studying the
impact of in vitro fertilization on adult reproductive health. It is still too
early to determine exactly what developmental pathways lead to this disparity or 
what specific role the placenta plays; future work on this front will be critical
to establish the marmoset as an important model of fetal programming of
reproductive function in adulthood and across generations.

Common marmosets are suitable non-human primate models for many human diseases.
Standard values for blood parameters are required to evaluate physiological and
pathological situations. Two studies were conducted: study I to determine
standard values and study II to examine these under changed housing conditions.
In study I, all parameters for clinical chemistry were similar in range for both 
genders with these specifics: male marmosets had significantly higher total and
LDL cholesterol levels than females, whereas the mean corpuscular volume and the 
mean corpuscular haemoglobin were significantly lower than in females. In study
II, glucose, lymphocytes and salivary cortisol were significantly lower, and
faecal cortisol was increased during the change of housing conditions. In
conclusion, standard values for haematology and clinical chemistry for the common
marmoset were determined. Further on, parameters that are influenced by
relocation stress and its importance for experimental results are described.

The life span and survival parameters of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus)
in a breeding colony at CLEA Japan, Inc. were investigated. The average life span
of male marmosets was 148.5 ± 6.1 (mean ± SE) months of age (M), which was
significantly longer (P < 0.01) than that of females (111.7 ± 6.0 M).
Additionally, the male population reached 25-, 50-, 75- and 90 %-mortality at an 
older age than the female population. However, the maximum life span in males
(259.9 M) was shorter than in females (262.5 M). The survival of females shows a 
relatively continuous decline; however, the male marmosets show a slight decline 
in survival during the first 7-9 years and then a dramatic decrease and another
slight decline after 14-16 year of age in survival, i.e., a lifespan curve
similar to what is observed in colonies of aging rodents and humans. The
sex-associated difference in life span was caused by reproductive burden on the
females. The present study reported a longer than expected life span of the
marmoset, and a long-lived animal can be a powerful model for senescence and
longevity sciences.

BACKGROUND: Many human diseases are modulated by intrauterine environment, which 
is called prenatal programming. This study investigated effects of prenatal
glucocorticoids on the lipid metabolism of three filial generations of common
marmosets.
METHODS: Pregnant primates were treated with dexamethasone during pregnancy. Body
weight and blood lipid parameters of adult female offspring (F1: n = 5, F2: n =
6, F3: n = 3) were compared with age-related female controls (n = 12).
RESULTS: F1, F2, and F3 offspring showed significantly lower percentage of plasma
n3 fatty acids than controls. F2 and F3 presented higher cholesterol levels, with
significantly more LDL cholesterol, significantly less HDL triglycerides and an
enhanced cholesterol/HDL cholesterol ratio. Body weight was not significantly
affected.
CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal dexamethasone led to higher amounts of cardiovascular risk 
factors and less protective parameters in female F1-F3 offspring. The
intergenerational consequences suggest prenatal programming through epigenetic
effects.

The development of biologic molecules (monoclonal antibodies, cytokines, soluble 
receptors) as specific therapeutics for human disease creates a need for animal
models in which safety and efficacy can be tested. Models in lower animal species
are precluded when the reagents fail to recognize their targets, which is often
the case in rats and mice. In this Feature article we will highlight the common
marmoset, a small-bodied nonhuman primate (NHP), as a useful model in biomedical 
and preclinical translational research.

The draft genome sequences of several primates are available, providing insights 
into evolutionary and anthropological research. However, genomic resources from
New World monkeys are conspicuously lacking. To date, the genomes of only two
platyrrhine species, the common marmoset and the Bolivian squirrel monkey, have
been fully sequenced. This is especially limiting for comparative genomics
research, considering that New World monkeys are the most speciose primate group,
and platyrrhine genetic diversity is comparable to that of the catarrhines (i.e. 
apes and Old World monkeys). Here, we present the generation and annotation of
numerous sequence reads from the genomes of Spider monkey (Ateles belzebuth), Owl
monkey (Aotus lemurinus) and Uakari (Cacajao calvus), representing the three
platyrrhine families, Atelidae, Cebidae and Pitheciidae, respectively. These
sequencing reads were developed from gDNA shotgun libraries containing over 3000 
individual sequences with an average length of 726 bps. Of these sequences, 1220 
contain <20% repeats, and thus are potentially highly useful phylogenetic markers
for other platyrrhine species. Among them, a large number of sequencing reads
were found to match unique regions within the human (2462 sequences) and the
marmoset (2829 sequences) genomes. In particular, the majority of these
sequencing reads are from putatively neutrally evolving intergenic regions. Thus,
they are likely to be highly informative for inferring neutral evolutionary
patterns and genomic evolution for other New World monkeys.

An animal model that reflects human disease: the common marmoset (Callithrix
jacchus).

San Antonio, TX 78227, USA.

The common marmoset is a new world primate belonging to the Callitrichidae family
weighing between 350 and 400 g. The marmoset has been shown to be an outstanding 
model for studying aging, reproduction, neuroscience, toxicology, and infectious 
disease. With regard to their susceptibility to infectious agents, they are
exquisite NHP models for viral, protozoan and bacterial agents, as well as
prions. The marmoset provides the advantages of a small animal model in high
containment coupled with the immunological repertoire of a nonhuman primate and
susceptibility to wild type, non-adapted viruses.

The common marmoset New World monkey (Callithrix jacchus), is a primate model
with great potential for scientific research, including research on diabetes.
However, in opposite to Rhesus and Java monkeys (Macaca mulatta and Macaca
fascicularis) little is known about the marmosets islet microarchitecture,
glucose transporter and pancreatic marker gene expression. In this work we
analyze differences and similarities in size, shape, cellular composition and
intra-islet topography between the common marmoset and the human endocrine
pancreas. Different sized, circular and a-circular shaped islets of the common
marmoset and human display α-cells in the whole islet organ leading to a
ribbon-like islet type. The number of islets was significantly higher in the
common marmoset compared with humans. However, the area of insulin-producing
cells was significantly higher in the human pancreas. Intra-islet distribution
pattern of δ- and β-cells was similar in both species. The morphology of the
exocrine pancreas regarding acinar and ductal cells was quite similar as
confirmed by ultrastructural analysis. Additionally the ultrastructure of
secretory granules from α-, δ- and β-cells of human and non-human primate
pancreas showed the same characteristics. Molecular analysis showed the presence 
of endocrine pancreatic marker genes like PMCA2, NCX1, SUR1, KIR6.2, MAFA, NGN3
and PDX1 also expressed in the human. For the first time we could show presence
of Glut 5 and 9 transporters in addition to the low abundance transporter Glut2
and the highly expressed Glut1 glucose transporter. We propose that Callithrix
jacchus displays a new animal model for diabetes research and regenerative
medicine.

The marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a valuable non-human primate model for
studying behavioral and neural mechanisms related to vocal communication. It is
also well suited for investigating neural mechanisms related to cochlear
implants. The purpose of this study was to characterize marmoset temporal bone
anatomy and investigate the feasibility of implanting a multi-channel
intracochlear electrode into the marmoset scala tympani. Micro computed
tomography (microCT) was used to create high-resolution images of marmoset
temporal bones. Cochlear fluid spaces, middle ear ossicles, semicircular canals
and the surrounding temporal bone were reconstructed in three-dimensional space. 
Our results show that the marmoset cochlea is ∼16.5 mm in length and has ∼2.8
turns. The cross-sectional area of the scala tympani is greatest (∼0.8 mm(2)) at 
∼1.75 mm from the base of the scala, reduces to ∼0.4 mm(2) at 5 mm from the base,
and decreases at a constant rate for the remaining length. Interestingly, this
length-area profile, when scaled 2.5 times, is similar to the scala tympani of
the human cochlea. Given these dimensions, a compatible multi-channel implant
electrode was identified. In a cadaveric specimen, this electrode was inserted ¾ 
turn into the scala tympani through a cochleostomy at ∼1 mm apical to the round
window. The depth of the most apical electrode band was ∼8 mm. Our study provides
detailed structural anatomy data for the middle and inner ear of the marmoset,
and suggests the potential of the marmoset as a new non-human primate model for
cochlear implant research.

Minimally invasive transabdominal collection of preimplantation embryos from the 
common marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus).

A novel, minimally invasive, transabdominal embryo collection method
(transabdominal method) was developed as an alternative to a standard abdominal
incision for embryo collection in the common marmoset. The abdominal incision
method was used for 304 flushes using 36 female animals, whereas the
transabdominal method was used for 488 flushes using 48 females; successful
embryo collection rates were 48.0% and 48.4% (P > 0.05), respectively. These
techniques were successfully duplicated at another institute (German Primate
Center, DPZ). At that institution, successful embryo collection rates were 88.9% 
and 77.8% for the abdominal incision and transabdominal methods, respectively (P 
> 0.05), whereas the average numbers of preimplantation embryos obtained per
flush were (mean ± SD) 1.91 ± 0.35 and 1.71 ± 0.14 (P > 0.05). The transabdominal
method reduced animal stress, did not require incisional wound healing, and
enabled successive embryo recoveries to be done much sooner. More embryos in
early developmental stages (zygotes/morulae) were recovered using the
transabdominal method (76.1%) than the abdominal incision method (52.6%, P <
0.01). In contrast, recovery of arrested or abnormal embryos was not
significantly different between these two methods (9.8% and 8.3%). To verify
developmental ability of embryos recovered by the transabdominal method, transfer
of 28 normal embryos to 14 surrogate mothers yielded a nidation rate of 57%. Five
females sustained term pregnancies and eight neonates were born. This novel
transabdominal method will facilitate progress in marmoset developmental biology 
and embryology.

Developmental expression of the pluripotency factor sal-like protein 4 in the
monkey, human and mouse testis: restriction to premeiotic germ cells.

Research, Göttingen, Germany.

SALL4 (sal-like protein 4) is a pluripotency transcription factor, which is
highly expressed in embryonic stem (ES) cells and which is essential for mouse
preimplantation development. In adult mouse organs, Sall4 mRNA is highly
expressed in the testis and ovary, while there is only little or no expression in
other organs. There is also a high expression of SALL4 in human testicular germ
cell tumors. However, there is as yet no detailed analysis of SALL4 expression
during mammalian testicular development. We analyzed SALL4 expression in ES
cells, preimplantation embryos, and the developing and adult testis of a nonhuman
primate (NHP) species, the common marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus).
Immunofluorescence revealed SALL4 in the nuclei of marmoset ES cells and
preimplantation embryos. Marmoset SALL4 isoform analysis in ES cells and newborn 
and adult testis by RT- PCR and Western blotting showed two different isoforms,
SALL4-A and SALL4-B. Immunohistochemistry localized this transcription factor to 
the nuclei of primordial germ cells and most gonocytes in the prenatal and early 
postnatal marmoset testis. In the pubertal and adult testis SALL4 was present in 
undifferentiated spermatogonia. In the developing and adult human and mouse
testis SALL4 expression mimicked the pattern in the marmoset. Adult testes from
additional NHP species, the treeshrew, the cat and the dog also exhibited SALL4
in undifferentiated spermatogonia, indicating a conserved expression in the
mammalian testis. Taking into account the importance of SALL4 for mouse
development, we conclude that SALL4 may play an important role during mammalian
germ cell development and is involved in the regulation of spermatogonial
proliferation in the adult testis.

Embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells (IPSCs) derived from mammalian
species are valuable tools for modeling human disease, including retinal
degenerative eye diseases that result in visual loss. Restoration of vision has
focused on transplantation of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and retinal
pigmented epithelium (RPE) to the retina. Here we used transgenic common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus) and human pluripotent stem cells carrying the enhanced green
fluorescent protein (eGFP) reporter as a model system for retinal
differentiation. Using suspension and subsequent adherent differentiation
cultures, we observed spontaneous in vitro differentiation that included NPCs and
cells with pigment granules characteristic of differentiated RPE. Retinal cells
derived from human and common marmoset pluripotent stem cells provide potentially
unlimited cell sources for testing safety and immune compatibility following
autologous or allogeneic transplantation using nonhuman primates in early
translational applications.

In mammals, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and the intergeniculate leaflet
(IGL) are the main components of the circadian timing system. The SCN is the site
of the endogenous biological clock that generates rhythms and synchronizes them
to environmental cues. The IGL is a key structure that modulates SCN activity and
is responsible for the transmission of non-photic information to the SCN, thus
participating in the integration between photic and non-photic stimuli. Both the 
SCN and IGL receive projections of retinal ganglion cells and the IGL is
connected to the SCN through the geniculohypothalamic tract. Little is known
about these structures in the primate brain and the pregeniculate nucleus (PGN)
has been suggested to be the primate equivalent of the rodent IGL. The aim of
this study was to characterize the PGN of a primate, the common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus), and to analyze its retinal afferents. Here, the marmoset
PGN was found to be organized into three subsectors based on neuronal size,
pattern of retinal projections, and the distribution of neuropeptide Y-, GAD-,
serotonin-, enkephalin- and substance P-labeled terminals. This pattern indicates
that the marmoset PGN is equivalent to the IGL. This detailed description
contributes to the understanding of the circadian timing system in this primate
species considering the importance of the IGL within the context of circadian
regulation.

Callithrix jacchus (common marmoset) is regularly used in biomedical research,
including for studies involving the skeleton. To support these studies, skeletons
of healthy animals that had been euthanized for reasons not interfering with
skeletal anatomy were prepared. The marmoset dental formula 2I-1C-3P-2M of each
oral quadrant is atypical for New World monkeys which commonly possess a third
molar. Seven cervical, 12-13 thoracic, 7-6 lumbar, 2-3 sacral and 26-29 caudal
vertebrae are present, the thoracolumbar region always comprising 19 vertebrae. A
sigmoid clavicle connects the scapula with the manubrium of the sternum.
Depending on the number of thoracic vertebrae, 4-5 sternebrae are located between
the manubrium and xiphoid process. Wide interosseous spaces separate the radius
from the ulna, and the tibia from the fibula. A small sesamoid bone is inserted
in the m. abductor digiti primi longus at the medial border of the carpus, a pair
of ovoid sesamoid bones is located at the palmar/plantar sides of the trochleae
of each metapodial bone, and round fabellae articulate with the proximal surfaces
of the femoral condyles. Male marmosets possess a small penile bone. Both the
front and hind feet have five digits. The hallux possesses a flat nail, whereas
all other digits present curved claws. Interestingly, a central bone is present
in both the carpus and tarsus. This study provides a description and detailed
illustrations of the skeleton of the common marmoset as an anatomical guide for
further biomedical research.

BACKGROUND: Heightened fear and anxiety are core symptoms of a variety of
neuropsychiatric disorders. They are associated with structural and activity
changes throughout neural circuitry that includes the ventral and medial
prefrontal cortices (PFC), the amygdala, and hippocampus. Although the
contributions of the medial PFC, amygdala, and hippocampus to fear and anxiety
have been studied extensively with animal models, the selective roles of the
ventral PFC-including the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) and
orbitofrontal cortex-are poorly understood.
METHODS: We investigated the effects of selective excitotoxic lesions of either
the vlPFC or anterior orbitofrontal cortex (antOFC) on anxious behavior and
Pavlovian conditioned autonomic and behavioral fear responses in the New World
primate, the common marmoset.
RESULTS: Both vlPFC and antOFC lesions resulted in stronger, less adaptable
conditioned fear responses. They also heightened the anxiety responses of a
marmoset to a human intruder. In contrast, only a lesion of the vlPFC affected
the coping style that a marmoset displayed in the presence of the human intruder,
increasing the likelihood of proactive mobbing.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that both the antOFC and vlPFC can
downregulate fear and anxiety and, together, provide necessary but independent
contributions to the top-down control of negative emotion.

Advances in mouse neural circuit genetics, brain atlases, and behavioral assays
provide a powerful system for modeling the genetic basis of cognition and
psychiatric disease. However, a critical limitation of this approach is how to
achieve concordance of mouse neurobiology with the ultimate goal of understanding
the human brain. Previously, the common marmoset has shown promise as a genetic
model system toward the linking of mouse and human studies. However, the advent
of marmoset transgenic approaches will require an understanding of developmental 
principles in marmoset compared to mouse. In this study, we used gene expression 
analysis in marmoset brain to pose a series of fundamental questions on cortical 
development and evolution for direct comparison to existing mouse brain atlas
expression data. Most genes showed reliable conservation of expression between
marmoset and mouse. However, certain markers had strikingly divergent expression 
patterns. The lateral geniculate nucleus and pulvinar in the thalamus showed
diversification of genetic organization between marmoset and mouse, suggesting
they share some similarity. In contrast, gene expression patterns in early visual
cortical areas showed marmoset-specific expression. In prefrontal cortex, some
markers labeled architectonic areas and layers distinct between mouse and
marmoset. Core hippocampus was conserved, while afferent areas showed divergence.
Together, these results indicate that existing cortical areas are genetically
conserved between marmoset and mouse, while differences in areal parcellation,
afferent diversification, and layer complexity are associated with specific
genes. Collectively, we propose that gene expression patterns in marmoset brain
reveal important clues to the principles underlying the molecular evolution of
cortical and cognitive expansion.

Technology Zurich (ETHZ), 8057 Zürich, Switzerland.

The lateral ventricle (LV) of the adult rodent brain harbors neural stem cells
(NSCs) that continue to generate new neurons throughout life. NSCs located in
defined areas of the LV walls generate progenitors with distinct transcriptional 
profiles that are committed to specific neuronal fates. Here, we assessed if such
diversity of NSCs also exist in the adult common marmoset, a widely used primate 
species in basic and clinical neuroscience research. We first investigated the 3D
distributions of proliferative progenitors and committed neuroblasts in the
marmoset forebrain. In addition to these maps, we assessed the spatial presence
of divergent progenitor populations based on their expression of defined
transcription factors, that is, Dlx2, Pax6, Tbr2, and Ngn2 which are
differentially expressed by γ-aminobutyric acidergic versus glutamatergic
progenitors in the adult rodent forebrain. In striking contrast to rodents,
glutamatergic progenitors were only sparse in neonates and absent from the adult 
LV, whilst present in the hippocampus. Our analyses highlight major differences
in the diversity of NSCs of the marmoset LV compared with rodents and emphasize
the need to address NSCs diversity in evolutionary higher order mammals
concomitantly to rodents.

Misleading and reliable markers to differentiate between primate testis-derived
multipotent stromal cells and spermatogonia in culture.

Author information: 
(1)German Primate Center, Leibniz Institute for Primate Research, Kellnerweg 4,
Göttingen, Germany.

BACKGROUND: Several studies have reported the generation of spermatogonia-derived
pluripotent stem cells from human testes. The initial aim of the present study
was the derivation of equivalent stem cells from an established and
experimentally accessible non-human primate model, the common marmoset monkey
(Callithrix jacchus). However, an essential prerequisite in the absence of
transgenic reporters in primates and man is the availability of validated
endogenous markers for the identification of specific cell types in vitro.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We cultured marmoset testicular cells in a similar way to
that described for human testis-derived pluripotent cells and set out to
characterize these cultures under different conditions and in differentiation
assays applying established marker panels. Importantly, the cells emerged as
testicular multipotent stromal cells (TMSCs) instead of (pluripotent) germ
cell-derived cells. TMSCs expressed many markers such as GFR-α, GPR125, THY-1
(CD90), ITGA6, SSEA4 and TRA-1-81, which were considered as spermatogonia
specific and were previously used for the enrichment or characterization of
spermatogonia. Proliferation of TMSCs was highly dependent on basic fibroblast
growth factor, a growth factor routinely present in germ cell culture media. As
reliable markers for the distinction between spermatogonia and TMSCs, we
established VASA, in combination with the spermatogonia-expressed factors,
MAGEA4, PLZF and SALL4.
CONCLUSIONS: Marmoset monkey TMSCs and spermatogonia exhibit an overlap of
markers, which may cause erroneous interpretations of experiments with
testis-derived stem cells in vitro. We provide a marker panel for the unequivocal
identification of spermatogonia providing a better basis for future studies on
primate, including human, testis-derived stem cells.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an adult-onset neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by the death of upper and lower motor neurons. Approximately 20% of
familial ALS cases are caused by mutations in the superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1)
gene. We generated rats that express a human SOD1 transgene with two different
ALS-associated mutations and found that these rats develop remarkable motor
neuron degeneration and paralysis. This rat model, because of the larger size of 
the animals as compared to ALS-affected mice, will facilitate studies involving
manipulation of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (e.g., implantation of intrathecal 
catheters for chronic therapeutic studies; CSF sampling) or spinal cord (e.g.,
direct administration of viral- and cell-mediated therapies). The hepatocyte
growth factor (HGF) is one of the most potent survival-promoting factors for
motor neurons. To examine its protective effect on motor neurons and its
therapeutic potential, we administered human recombinant HGF (hrHGF) to the
transgenic rats, by continuous intrathecal delivery, for 4 weeks from the onset
of paralysis. Intrathecal administration of hrHGF attenuated motor neuron
degeneration and prolonged the duration of the disease 62.7% compared with the
contrast group. Our results indicated the therapeutic efficacy of continuous
intrathecal administration of hrHGF in ALS rats. To explore the potential use of 
this treatment strategy in humans, we induced a contusive cervical spinal cord
injury in the common marmoset, a primate, and then administered hrHGF
intrathecally. The intrathecal administration of hrHGF promoted functional
recovery. These projects have been supported by the "Super Special Consortium for

Germ cell development is a fundamental process required to produce offspring. The
developmental program of spermatogenesis has been assumed to be similar among
mammals. However, recent studies have revealed differences in the molecular
properties of primate germ cells compared with the well-characterized mouse germ 
cells. This may prevent simple application of rodent insights into higher
primates. Therefore, thorough investigation of primate germ cells is necessary,
as this may lead to the development of more appropriate animal models. The aim of
this study is to define molecular signatures of spermatogenic cells in the common
marmoset, Callithrix jacchus. Interestingly, NANOG, PRDM1, DPPA3 (STELLA),
IFITM3, and ZP1 transcripts, but no POU5F1 (OCT4), were detected in adult
marmoset testis. Conversely, mouse testis expressed Pou5f1 but not Nanog, Prdm1, 
Dppa3, Ifitm3, and Zp1. Other previously described mouse germ cell markers were
conserved in marmoset and mouse testes. Intriguingly, marmoset spermatogenic
cells underwent dynamic protein expression in a developmental stage-specific
manner; DDX4 (VASA) protein was present in gonocytes, diminished in
spermatogonial cells, and reexpressed in spermatocytes. To investigate epigenetic
differences between adult marmoset and mice, DNA methylation analyses identified 
unique epigenetic profiles to marmoset and mice. Marmoset NANOG and POU5F1
promoters in spermatogenic cells exhibited a methylation status opposite to that 
in mice, while the DDX4 and LEFTY1 loci, as well as imprinted genes, displayed an
evolutionarily conserved methylation pattern. Marmosets have great advantages as 
models for human reproductive biology and are also valuable as experimental
nonhuman primates; thus, the current study provides an important platform for
primate reproductive biology, including possible applications to humans.

As part of a larger experiment investigating serotonergic regulation of female
marmoset sexual behavior, this study was designed to (1) advance methods for PET 
imaging of common marmoset monkey brain, (2) measure normalized FDG uptake as an 
index of local cerebral metabolic rates for glucose, and (3) study changes
induced in this index of cerebral glucose metabolism by chronic treatment of
female marmosets with a serotonin 1A receptor (5-HT(1A)) agonist. We hypothesized
that chronic treatment with the 5-HT(1A) agonist 8-OH-DPAT would alter the
glucose metabolism index in dorsal raphe (DR), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC),
medial preoptic area of hypothalamus (mPOA), ventromedial nucleus of hypothalamus
(VMH), and field CA1 of hippocampus. Eight adult ovariectomized female common
marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) were studied with and without estradiol
replacement. In a crossover design, each subject was treated daily with 8-OH-DPAT
(0.1mg/kg SC daily) or saline. After 42-49 days of treatment, the glucose
metabolism radiotracer FDG was administered to each female immediately prior to
30 min of interaction with her male pairmate, after which the subject was
anesthetized and imaged by PET. Whole brain normalized PET images were analyzed
with anatomically defined regions of interest (ROI). Whole brain voxelwise
mapping was also used to explore treatment effects and correlations between
alterations in the glucose metabolism index and pairmate interactions. The rank
order of normalized FDG uptake was VMH/mPOA>DR>mPFC/CA1 in both conditions.
8-OH-DPAT did not induce alterations in the glucose metabolism index in ROIs.
Voxelwise mapping showed a significant reduction in normalized FDG uptake in
response to 8-OH-DPAT in a cluster in medial occipital cortex as well as a
significant correlation between increased rejection of mount attempts and reduced
normalized FDG uptake in an overlapping cluster. In conclusion, PET imaging has
been used to measure FDG uptake relative to whole brain in marmoset monkeys.
Voxelwise mapping shows that 8-OH-DPAT reduces this index of glucose metabolism
in medial occipital cortex, consistent with alterations in female sexual
behavior.

Five strains of bifidobacteria were isolated from faeces of a common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus) and a red-handed tamarin (Saguinus midas). The five isolates
clustered inside the phylogenetic group of the genus Bifidobacterium but did not 
show high sequence similarities between the isolates and to known species in the 
genus by phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences. Sequence
analyses of dnaJ1 and hsp60 also indicated their independent phylogenetic
positions to each other in the Bifidobacterium cluster. DNA G+C contents of the
species ranged from 57.3 to 66.3 mol%, which is within the values recorded for
Bifidobacterium species. All isolates showed fructose-6-phosphate phosphoketolase
activity. Based on the data provided, the five isolates represent five novel
species, for which the names Bifidobacterium reuteri sp. nov. (type strain:
AFB22-1(T) = JCM 17295(T) = DSM 23975(T)), Bifidobacterium callitrichos sp. nov.

The present study was conducted to test predictions of the oxidative stress
theory of aging assessing reactive oxygen species production and oxidative stress
resistance in cultured fibroblasts from 13 primate species ranging in body size
from 0.25 to 120 kg and in longevity from 20 to 90 years. We assessed both basal 
and stress-induced reactive oxygen species production in fibroblasts from five
great apes (human, chimpanzee, bonobo, gorilla, and orangutan), four Old World
monkeys (baboon, rhesus and crested black macaques, and patas monkey), three New 
World monkeys (common marmoset, red-bellied tamarin, and woolly monkey), and one 
lemur (ring-tailed lemur). Measurements of cellular MitoSox fluorescence, an
indicator of mitochondrial superoxide (O2(·-)) generation, showed an inverse
correlation between longevity and steady state or metabolic stress-induced
mitochondrial O2(·-) production, but this correlation was lost when the effects
of body mass were removed, and the data were analyzed using phylogenetically
independent contrasts. Fibroblasts from longer-lived primate species also
exhibited superior resistance to H(2)O(2)-induced apoptotic cell death than cells
from shorter-living primates. After correction for body mass and lack of
phylogenetic independence, this correlation, although still discernible, fell
short of significance by regression analysis. Thus, increased longevity in this
sample of primates is not causally associated with low cellular reactive oxygen
species generation, but further studies are warranted to test the association
between increased cellular resistance to oxidative stressor and primate
longevity.

Allelic lineages of the ficolin genes (FCNs) are passed from ancestral to
descendant primates.

The ficolins recognize carbohydrates and acetylated compounds on microorganisms
and dying host cells and are able to activate the lectin pathway of the
complement system. In humans, three ficolin genes have been identified: FCN1,
FCN2 and FCN3, which encode ficolin-1, ficolin-2 and ficolin-3, respectively.
Rodents have only two ficolins designated ficolin-A and ficolin-B that are
closely related to human ficolin-1, while the rodent FCN3 orthologue is a
pseudogene. Ficolin-2 and ficolin-3 have so far only been observed in humans.
Thus, we performed a systematic investigation of the FCN genes in non-human
primates. The exons and intron-exon boundaries of the FCN1-3 genes were sequenced
in the following primate species: chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, rhesus macaque,
cynomolgus macaque, baboon and common marmoset. We found that the exon
organisation of the FCN genes was very similar between all the non-human primates
and the human FCN genes. Several variations in the FCN genes were found in more
than one primate specie suggesting that they were carried from one species to
another including humans. The amino acid diversity of the ficolins among human
and non-human primate species was estimated by calculating the Shannon entropy
revealing that all three proteins are generally highly conserved. Ficolin-1 and
ficolin-2 showed the highest diversity, whereas ficolin-3 was more conserved.
Ficolin-2 and ficolin-3 were present in non-human primate sera with the same
characteristic oligomeric structures as seen in human serum. Taken together all
the FCN genes show the same characteristics in lower and higher primates. The
existence of trans-species polymorphisms suggests that different FCN allelic
lineages may be passed from ancestral to descendant species.

Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus (RVFV) can cause severe human disease characterized
by either acute-onset hepatitis, delayed-onset encephalitis, retinitis and
blindness, or a hemorrhagic syndrome. The existing nonhuman primate (NHP) model
for RVF utilizes an intravenous (i.v.) exposure route in rhesus macaques (Macaca 
mulatta). Severe disease in these animals is infrequent, and large cohorts are
needed to observe significant morbidity and mortality. To overcome these
drawbacks, we evaluated the infectivity and pathogenicity of RVFV in the common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) by i.v., subcutaneous (s.c.), and intranasal
exposure routes to more closely mimic natural exposure. Marmosets were more
susceptible to RVFV than rhesus macaques and experienced higher rates of
morbidity, mortality, and viremia and marked aberrations in hematological and
chemistry values. An overwhelming infection of hepatocytes was a major
consequence of infection of marmosets by the i.v. and s.c. exposure routes.
Additionally, these animals displayed signs of hemorrhagic manifestations and
neurological impairment. Based on our results, the common marmoset model more
closely resembles severe human RVF disease and is therefore an ideal model for
the evaluation of potential vaccines and therapeutics.

spinal cord injury.

Many therapeutic interventions for spinal cord injury (SCI) using neurotrophic
factors have focused on reducing the area damaged by secondary, post-injury
degeneration, to promote functional recovery. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF),
which is a potent mitogen for mature hepatocytes and a mediator of the
inflammatory responses to tissue injury, was recently highlighted as a potent
neurotrophic factor in the central nervous system. We previously reported that
introducing exogenous HGF into the injured rodent spinal cord using a herpes
simplex virus-1 vector significantly reduces the area of damaged tissue and
promotes functional recovery. However, that study did not examine the therapeutic
effects of administering HGF after injury, which is the most critical issue for
clinical application. To translate this strategy to human treatment, we induced a
contusive cervical SCI in the common marmoset, a primate, and then administered
recombinant human HGF (rhHGF) intrathecally. Motor function was assessed using an
original open field scoring system focusing on manual function, including
reach-and-grasp performance and hand placement in walking. The intrathecal rhHGF 
preserved the corticospinal fibers and myelinated areas, thereby promoting
functional recovery. In vivo magnetic resonance imaging showed significant
preservation of the intact spinal cord parenchyma. rhHGF-treatment did not give
rise to an abnormal outgrowth of calcitonin gene related peptide positive fibers 
compared to the control group, indicating that this treatment did not induce or
exacerbate allodynia. This is the first study to report the efficacy of rhHGF for
treating SCI in non-human primates. In addition, this is the first presentation
of a novel scale for assessing neurological motor performance in non-human
primates after contusive cervical SCI.

Studies of inhalational melioidosis were undertaken in the common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus). Following exposure to an inhaled challenge with aerosolized
Burkholderia pseudomallei, lethal infection was observed in marmosets challenged 
with doses below 10 cfu; a precise LD(50) determination was not possible. The
model was further characterized using a target challenge dose of approximately
10(2) cfu. A separate pathogenesis time-course experiment was also conducted. All
animals succumbed, between 27 and 78 h postchallenge. The challenge dose received
and the time to the humane endpoint (1 °C below normal body temperature
postfever) were correlated. The first indicator of disease was an increased core 
body temperature (T(c) ), at 22 h postchallenge. This coincided with bacteraemia 
and bacterial dissemination. Overt clinical signs were first observed 3-5 h
later. A sharp decrease (typically within 3-6 h) in the T(c) was observed prior
to humanely culling the animals in the lethality study. Pathology was noted in
the lung, liver and spleen. Disease progression in the common marmoset appears to
be consistent with human infection in terms of bacterial spread, pathology and
physiology. The common marmoset can therefore be considered a suitable animal
model for further studies of inhalational melioidosis.

Subventricular zone (SVZ) progenitors are a hallmark of the developing neocortex.
Recent studies described a novel type of SVZ progenitor that retains a basal
process at mitosis, sustains expression of radial glial markers, and is capable
of self-renewal. These progenitors, referred to here as basal radial glia (bRG), 
occur at high relative abundance in the SVZ of gyrencephalic primates (human) and
nonprimates (ferret) but not lissencephalic rodents (mouse). Here, we analyzed
the occurrence of bRG cells in the embryonic neocortex of the common marmoset
Callithrix jacchus, a near-lissencephalic primate. bRG cells, expressing Pax6,
Sox2 (but not Tbr2), glutamate aspartate transporter, and glial fibrillary acidic
protein and retaining a basal process at mitosis, occur at similar relative
abundance in the marmoset SVZ as in human and ferret. The proportion of
progenitors in M-phase was lower in embryonic marmoset than developing ferret
neocortex, raising the possibility of a longer cell cycle. Fitting the
gyrification indices of 26 anthropoid species to an evolutionary model suggested 
that the marmoset evolved from a gyrencephalic ancestor. Our results suggest that
a high relative abundance of bRG cells may be necessary, but is not sufficient,
for gyrencephaly and that the marmoset's lissencephaly evolved secondarily by
changing progenitor parameters other than progenitor type.

We described the preparation of acute living slices from the hippocampus of the
neonatal common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). Slices from a temporal lobe
section were prepared quickly using a rotary slicer. By this method, we
successfully recorded field potentials, namely, pre-synaptic fiber volley and
field excitatory post-synaptic potentials, from the hippocampal CA1 region with
conventional electrophysiological techniques, and analyzed the indicators of
synaptic function such as input-output curve. This study thus presents an
efficient preparation method for acute living hippocampal slice from which
synaptic function of the hippocampus in non-human primate can be analyzed.

Perception-based measures often reveal much earlier competencies than
action-based approaches. We explored this phenomenon generally labeled as
"knowledge dissociation" in 28 common marmoset monkeys (Callithrix jacchus) using
a paradigm where subjects had to localize a food item dropped down an opaque
tube. Experiments 1 and 2 assessed common marmoset monkeys' gravity bias in an
action based version of the tubes task. Experiments 3 and 4 investigated whether 
marmosets' performance increases in an action-free task context where they simply
look at objects falling down a tube. The results suggest that common marmosets
have some intuition of continuity/solidity constraints when tested with
perception based measures even though these principles do not appear to guide
their search for falling objects.

BACKGROUND: Current knowledge about the optimal energy and nutrient supply for
common marmoset monkeys (Callithrix jacchus) is scarce, and more information is
needed for establishing the underlying nutritional concepts for facilitating
longevity of this species as laboratory animals for biomedical research.
METHODS: Two feeding experiments were conducted to yield fundamental data about
feed acceptance, real feed intake, and feed preferences under laboratory
conditions. Newly developed feeding concepts for marmoset monkeys were also
examined in preliminary investigations to compare the outcomes with those of a
commercial pelletized mixed feed.
RESULTS: The first experiments showed preferences for main protein sources in the
diets studied, specifically that plant proteins are more accepted than fish meal 
or egg protein as the main protein source. Several aroma supplements did not
modify the acceptance and feed intake markedly.
CONCLUSIONS: The newly developed feeding concept yielded promising preliminary
data for long-term studies of energy and nutrient supply under laboratory
conditions. However, studies of the fundamental requirements are still needed.

BACKGROUND: Common marmosets are widely used as experimental primates; however,
little is still known about their bone physiology. Therefore, the aim of our
study was to analyse body weight, age and bone-specific blood parameters in
relation to morphological bone parameters.
METHODS: Fifty-eight common marmosets were analysed for blood calcium (Ca),
inorganic phosphor (P(i) ), alkaline phosphatase (AP) and 17-β-estradiol (E2).
The examination of bone parameters was undertaken in the lumbar spine by computer
tomography.
RESULTS: There was a correlation between bone mineral density (BMD) and body
weight, trabecular area ratio and polar moment as well as between BMD and AP or
Ca (only males), whereas there were no correlations between BMD and age, P(i) or 
E2 in all analysed genders.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data support the assumption that the common marmoset is a
reliable primate model to study changes in bone metabolism because of the
similarity of our results to humans.

Cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) is widely distributed in the
brain of many species. In the hypothalamus, CART neurotransmission has been
implicated in diverse functions including energy balance, stress response, and
temperature and endocrine regulation. Although some studies have been performed
in primates, very little is known about the distribution of CART neurons in New
World monkeys. New World monkeys are good models for systems neuroscience, as
some species have evolved several behavioral and anatomical characteristics
shared with humans, including diurnal and social habits, intense maternal care,
complex manipulative abilities and well-developed frontal cortices. In the
present study, we assessed the distribution of CART mRNA and peptide in the
hypothalamus of the capuchin monkey (Cebus apella) and the common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus). We found that the distribution of hypothalamic CART neurons
in these monkeys is similar to what has been described for rodents and humans,
but some relevant differences were noticed. Only in capuchin monkeys CART neurons
were observed in the suprachiasmatic and the intercalatus nuclei, whereas only in
marmoset CART neurons were observed in the dorsal anterior nucleus. We also found
that the only in marmoset displayed CART neurons in the periventricular preoptic 
nucleus and in an area seemingly comprising the premammillary nucleus. These
hypothalamic sites are both well defined in rodents but poorly defined in humans.
Our findings indicate that CART expression in hypothalamic neurons is conserved
across species but the identified differences suggest that CART is also involved 
in the control of species-specific related functions.

A 3-year-old female common marmoset was euthanatized because of wasting. Grossly,
a perforating lesion was present in the jejunum and hemorrhagic lesions in the
cecum and colon. Histopathologically, these gross lesions were a perforated
jejunal ulcer and necrotizing colitis, respectively. Necrotizing colitis was
characterized by extensive mucosal necrosis along with numerous ribbon-shaped
aseptate hyphae. These aseptate hyaline hyphae were positively stained with PAS
and GMS, and reacted immunohistochemically with the antibody against the family
Mucoraceae. This case was diagnosed as intestinal mucormycosis. This is the first
report on mucormycosis in a common marmoset.

disease parameters in a novel marmoset model for multiple sclerosis.

The core pathogenic process in the common marmoset model of multiple sclerosis
(MS) is the activation of memory-like T cells specific for peptide 34 to 56
derived from the extracellular domain of myelin/oligodendrocyte glycoprotein
(MOG(34-56)). Immunization with MOG(34-56) in incomplete Freund's adjuvant is a
sufficient stimulus for in vivo activation of these T cells, together with the
induction of MS-like disease and CNS pathology. Ex vivo functional
characteristics of MOG(34-56) specific T cells are specific cytolysis of peptide 
pulsed target cells and high IL-17A production. To indentify possible functions
in this new model of T helper 1 cells, which play a central pathogenic role in MS
models induced with complete Freund's adjuvant, we tested the effect of human
interferon-γ (IFNγ) administration during disease initiation of the disease (day 
0-25) and around the time of disease expression (psd 56-81). The results show a
clear modulatory effect of early IFNγ treatment on humoral and cellular
autoimmune parameters, but no generalized mitigating effect on the disease
course. These results argue against a prominent pathogenic role of T helper 1
cells in this new marmoset EAE model.

The natural environment is inherently noisy with acoustic interferences. It is,
therefore, beneficial for a species to modify its vocal production to effectively
communicate in the presence of interfering noises. Non-human primates have been
traditionally considered to possess limited voluntary vocal control, but little
is known about their ability to modify vocal behavior when encountering
interfering noises. Here we tested the ability of the common marmoset (Callithrix
jacchus) to control the initiation of vocalizations and maintain vocal
interactions between pairs in an acoustic environment in which the length and
predictability (periodic or random aperiodic occurrences) of interfering noise
bursts were varied. Despite the presence of interfering noise, the marmosets
continued to engage in antiphonal calling behavior. Results showed that the
overwhelming majority of calls were initiated during silence gaps even when the
length of the silence gap following each noise burst was unpredictable. During
the periodic noise conditions, as the length of the silence gap decreased, the
latency between the end of noise burst and call onset decreased significantly. In
contrast, when presented with aperiodic noise bursts, the marmosets chose to call
predominantly during long (4 and 8 s) over short (2 s) silence gaps. In the 8 s
periodic noise conditions, a marmoset pair either initiated both calls of an
antiphonal exchange within the same silence gap or exchanged calls in two
consecutive silence gaps. Our findings provide compelling evidence that common
marmosets are capable of modifying their vocal production according to the
dynamics of their acoustic environment during vocal communication.

Ebolavirus and Marburgvirus are members of the filovirus family and induce a
fatal hemorrhagic disease in humans and nonhuman primates with 90% case fatality.
To develop a small nonhuman primate model for filovirus disease, common marmosets
(Callithrix jacchus) were intramuscularly inoculated with wild type Marburgvirus 
Musoke or Ebolavirus Zaire. The infection resulted in a systemic fatal disease
with clinical and morphological features closely resembling human infection.
Animals experienced weight loss, fever, high virus titers in tissue,
thrombocytopenia, neutrophilia, high liver transaminases and phosphatases and
disseminated intravascular coagulation. Evidence of a severe disseminated viral
infection characterized principally by multifocal to coalescing hepatic necrosis 
was seen in EBOV animals. MARV-infected animals displayed only moderate fibrin
deposition in the spleen. Lymphoid necrosis and lymphocytic depletion observed in
spleen. These findings provide support for the use of the common marmoset as a
small nonhuman primate model for filovirus induced hemorrhagic fever.

Wireless multi-channel single unit recording in freely moving and vocalizing
primates.

Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21205, USA.

The ability to record well-isolated action potentials from individual neurons in 
naturally behaving animals is crucial for understanding neural mechanisms
underlying natural behaviors. Traditional neurophysiology techniques, however,
require the animal to be restrained which often restricts natural behavior. An
example is the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a highly vocal New World
primate species, used in our laboratory to study the neural correlates of vocal
production and sensory feedback. When restrained by traditional
neurophysiological techniques marmoset vocal behavior is severely inhibited.
Tethered recording systems, while proven effective in rodents pose limitations in
arboreal animals such as the marmoset that typically roam in a three-dimensional 
environment. To overcome these obstacles, we have developed a wireless neural
recording technique that is capable of collecting single-unit data from
chronically implanted multi-electrodes in freely moving marmosets. A lightweight,
low power and low noise wireless transmitter (headstage) is attached to a
multi-electrode array placed in the premotor cortex of the marmoset. The wireless
headstage is capable of transmitting 15 channels of neural data with
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) comparable to a tethered system. To minimize
radio-frequency (RF) and electro-magnetic interference (EMI), the experiments
were conducted within a custom designed RF/EMI and acoustically shielded chamber.
The individual electrodes of the multi-electrode array were periodically advanced
to densely sample the cortical layers. We recorded single-unit data over a period
of several months from the frontal cortex of two marmosets. These recordings
demonstrate the feasibility of using our wireless recording method to study
single neuron activity in freely roaming primates.

Contribution of the amygdala, but not orbitofrontal or medial prefrontal
cortices, to the expression of flavour preferences in marmoset monkeys.

Cambridge, Downing Street, Cambridge CB2 3DY, UK.

The development of food preferences contributes to a balanced diet, and involves 
both innate and learnt factors. By associating flavour cues with the reinforcing 
properties of the food (i.e. postingestive nutrient cues and innately preferred
tastes, such as sweetness), animals acquire individual preferences. How the brain
codes and guides selection when the subject has to choose between different
palatable foods is little understood. To investigate this issue, we trained
common marmoset monkeys (Callithrix jacchus) to respond to abstract visual
patterns on a touch-sensitive computer screen to gain access to four different
flavoured juices. After preferences were stable, animals received excitotoxic
lesions of either the amygdala, the orbitofrontal cortex or the medial prefrontal
cortex. Neither the orbitofrontal nor the medial prefrontal cortex lesions
affected pre-surgery-expressed flavour preferences or the expression of
preferences for novel flavours post-surgery. In contrast, amygdala lesions caused
a shift in the preferences for juices expressed pre-surgery such that,
post-surgery, juices were chosen according to their overall carbohydrate (simple 
sugars) content or 'sweetness'. Subsequent tests revealed that amygdala-lesioned 
animals only expressed juice preferences if they differed in 'sweetness'. Unlike 
controls, orbitofrontal cortex-lesioned and medial prefrontal cortex-lesioned
animals, they were unable to display preferences between juices matched for
'sweetness' i.e. 5% sucrose solutions aromatised with different essential oils.
The most parsimonious explanation is that the amygdala contributes to the
expression of food preferences based on learnt cues but not those based on an
innate preference for sweetness.

Colonization with nontuberculous mycobacteria is associated with positive
tuberculin skin test reactions in the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).

Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections can result in significant morbidity and
mortality in nonhuman primate colonies. Preventative health programs designed to 
detect infection routinely include tuberculin skin testing (TST). Because
Mammalian Old Tuberculin used for TST contains antigens common to a variety of
mycobacterial species, false-positive results can occur in animals sensitized to 
nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM). Over 11 mo, a large colony of common marmosets
(Callithrix jacchus) demonstrated a 3.6% prevalence of equivocal or positive TST 
reactions (termed 'suspect reactions'). Culture of gastric aspirates,
bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and feces revealed a single animal with a positive 
fecal culture for Mycobacterium gordonae. PCR amplification of M. gordonae DNA in
feces collected from animals with suspect TST reactions (demonstrating a 66.7%
colonization rate) and colony controls (demonstrating a 14.3% colonization rate) 
revealed a significant association between suspect TST reactions and intestinal
colonization. Gross and histopathologic evaluation revealed a multifocal
lymphadenopathy and granulomatous lymphadenitis in 2 of 4 TST-positive marmosets 
examined. Counter to expectations, granulomatous lymphoid tissue was
culture-positive for M. kansasii rather than M. gordonae. Detection of M.
gordonae in the feces of TST-suspect animals likely represents an apathogenic
intestinal colonization that may serve as an indicator of NTM exposure, whereas
evidence of histopathologic disease is associated with the more pathogenic M.
kansasii. Although a high index of suspicion for M. tuberculosis should always be
maintained, colonization with NTM organisms represents a cause of suspect TST
reactions in common marmosets.

To analyze decision making under uncertainty of monkeys, common marmosets were
trained to choose and remove one of two colored caps on wells arranged side by
side. Each well contained constant reward (3 grains of puffed rice) or risky
reward (0 or 6 grains; probability, 50%:50%). For each marmoset, white or black
color was assigned randomly as a symbol of non-risky or risky choice. Arrangement
of white and black caps was determined randomly in each trial. After 200 trials
(5 trials per day), the marmosets were classified according to the pattern of
their choice. Eight of 18 marmosets (44.4%) were risk-aversive, whereas 5
marmosets (27.8%) were risk-prone. The remaining 5 marmosets (27.8%) preferred to
choose one side (left n=4, right n=1). These results showed individual
differences in decision making of marmosets. An additional task with reduction in
the expected value of the preferred choice revealed that risk-aversive marmosets 
were slower to adjust their choices to such reductions than risk-prone animals.

Reliability of distortion-product otoacoustic emissions in the common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus).

This study examines the test-retest reliability of distortion-product otoacoustic
emissions (DPOAEs) in ketamine-anesthetized common marmosets (Callithrix
jacchus). DPOAE gain functions were measured at 16 f(2)-frequencies between 3 and
24 kHz. Test-retest reliability was assessed at the following time intervals: (1)
Interleaved, in which two gain functions were obtained at each frequency before
advancing to the next frequency, (2) Immediate, wherein one gain function was
collected at all f(2)-frequencies and the retest was immediately performed
without removing the probe tip, (3) Short-term, in which the retest followed a
10-min period with the probe removed, and (4) Long-term, wherein the retest was
performed at least one week after the initial test. Reliability was assessed
using four correlation coefficients used in the literature. Test-retest
reliability was best in the interleaved interval and worst in the short-term
interval. In general, reliability was best when primary-tone levels were high.
Correlation coefficients decreased at frequencies above 12-kHz in the short-term 
and long-term intervals, but the decrease was more substantial in females than in
males in the long-term interval. At frequencies below 12 kHz, same-day
measurements (2, 3) were less repeatable, regardless of whether the probe was
removed, which may be due to time under anesthesia. These results have
implications for DPOAE studies where repeated measures are required and when
treatment or group differences are small.

We investigated sex determination via the ZFX and ZFY genes using PCR-RFLP in the
common marmoset. We designed a novel primer set to detect ZFX and ZFY. A 483-bp
band from the ZFX gene and a 471-bp band from the ZFY gene were amplified.
Sequencing data of the products amplified from ZFX and ZFY showed the recognition
sites of two restriction enzymes, DdeI and MseI, respectively. After digestion of
the products using each enzyme, we found that the band patterns between females
and males were different. PCR-based sex identification might provide a tool for
further breeding studies and experimental embryological studies using marmosets.

Zoonotic orthopoxvirus (OPV) can induce severe disease in man and the virus has
potential for use in bioterrorism. New vaccines and therapeutics against OPV
infections must be tested in animal models. The aim of this study was to
characterize the clinical course and pathology of a new OPV isolate, calpox
virus, which is infectious in marmosets. Infection experiments were performed
with 28 common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) exposed to different challenge
doses of calpox virus by the intravenous, oropharyngeal and intranasal (IN)
routes. The median marmoset IN infectious dose corresponded to 8.3 × 10(2)plaque 
forming units of calpox virus. Infected animals developed reproducible clinical
signs and died within 4-15 days post infection. Characteristic pox-like lesions
developed in affected organs, particularly in the skin, mucous membranes, lymph
nodes, liver and spleen. Calpox virus disease progression and pathological
findings in the common marmoset appear to be consistent with lethal OPV
infections in man and in other non-human primate (NHP) models. IN inoculation
with low virus doses mimics the natural route of the human variola virus
infection. Thus, the marmoset model of calpox virus infection can be considered
to be relevant to investigation of the mechanisms of OPV pathogenesis and
pathology and for the evaluation of new vaccines and antiviral therapies.

Because of the long-term co-evolution of TCR and MHC molecules, numerous
nucleotide substitutions have accumulated within the domains of TCRβ genes. We
previously found that nonsynonymous nucleotide substitutions occurred more
frequently in complementarity determining region (CDR)β than in CDRα, even though
only a limited number of common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) and human T-cell
receptor β variable (TRBV) sequences were compared. This interesting finding
raised the question of whether the increased selective pressure within CDRβ was
species-specific. In this study, we identified 21 TRBV region sequences from the 
common marmoset and performed comparative sequence analyses of the T-cell
receptor α variable (TRAV) and TRBV regions from human, chimpanzee, rhesus
monkey, cotton-top tamarin, Ma's night monkey, and common marmoset. The ratios of
the number of nonsynonymous nucleotide substitutions per site (d(N) ) to the d(S)
values (d(N) /d(S) ) were less than 1 within the framework regions (FRs) of TRAV 
and TRBV region sequences, suggesting that purifying selection is largely
dominant within the FRs. In contrast, the d(N) values were statistically
significantly greater for CDRβ than for CDRα only in New World monkeys. Also,
increased d(N) /d(S) ratios (d(N) /d(S) >1) were observed within CDRβ between
humans and New World monkeys and, interestingly, between New World monkeys, which
share a relatively recent common ancestor. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis by
maximum likelihood analysis provided firm evidence to support that positive
selection occurred within CDRβ along New World monkey lineages. These results
suggest that increased positive selection pressure within CDRβ is common in New
World monkeys rather than being species-specific. This study provides an
intriguing insight into the co-evolution of TCR and MHC molecules within
primates.

A juvenile common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) was attacked by a whitetail
lancehead viper (Bothrops leucurus) while playing with other group members close 
to the ground at a site in northeastern Brazil. The attack was almost immediately
fatal, but the viper was unable to ingest the body of the marmoset. After
approximately 10 min, during which it attempted to swallow the marmoset a number 
of times, the viper moved away, abandoning the body. While raptors are the
principal predators of callitrichids, this record reinforces the relative
vulnerability of these primates to snakes in comparison with other platyrrhines, 
although the small number of recorded events precludes a more definitive analysis
of the phenomenon.

Seven common marmoset monkeys (Callithrix jacchus) from a laboratory colony of 17
died over a period of eight months. Death of six of these monkeys was attributed 
to kidney failure from an oxalate-induced nephropathy. The epidemiology of this
outbreak suggested an exogenous source and there was strong evidence that the
source was bark and leaves from an Eucalyptus viminalis tree. Branches of this
tree were introduced one month before the first death. The branches were removed 
one month after deaths commenced, but deaths continued for another five months.
Urinalysis of all surviving marmosets at 80 and 122 days after initial contact
with the E viminalis branches suggested that these monkeys had renal impairment. 
In the cases described here, the eating behaviour of common marmosets apparently 
exposed the animals to toxic levels of oxalate in the bark and leaves of an E
viminalis tree.

In regenerative medicine, human cell replacement therapy offers great potential, 
especially by cell types differentiated from immunologically and ethically
unproblematic mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). In terms of an appropriate carrier
material, collagen scaffolds with homogeneous pore size of 65μm were optimal for 
cell seeding and cultivating. However, before clinical application and
transplantation of MSC-derived cells in scaffolds, the safety and efficiency, but
also possible interference in differentiation due to the material must be
preclinically tested. The common marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus) is a
preferable non-human primate animal model for this aim due to its genetic and
physiological similarities to the human. Marmoset bone marrow-derived MSCs were
successfully isolated, cultured and differentiated in suspension into adipogenic,
osteogenic and chondrogenic lineages by defined factors. The differentiation
capability could be determined by FACS. Specific marker genes for all three cell 
types could be detected by RT-PCR. Furthermore, MSCs seeded on collagen I
scaffolds differentiated in adipogenic lineage showed after 28days of
differentiation high cell viability and homogenous distribution on the material
which was validated by calcein AM and EthD staining. As proof of adipogenic
cells, the intracellular lipid vesicles in the cells were stained with Oil Red O.
The generation of fat vacuoles was visibly extensive distinguishable and
furthermore determined on the molecular level by expression of specific marker
genes. The results of the study proved both the differential potential of
marmoset MSCs in adipogenic, osteogenic and chondrogenic lineages and the
suitability of collagen scaffolds as carrier material undisturbing
differentiation of primate mesenchymal stem cells.

Impaired top-down regulation of the amygdala, and its modulation by serotonin
(5-HT), is strongly implicated in the dysregulation of negative emotion that
characterizes a number of affective disorders. However, the contribution of these
mechanisms to the regulation of positive emotion is not well understood. This
study investigated the role of 5-HT within the amygdala and the orbitofrontal
cortex (OFC), on the expression of appetitive Pavlovian conditioned emotional
responses and their reversal in a primate, the common marmoset. Its effects were 
compared to those of the amygdala itself. Having developed conditioned autonomic 
and behavioural responses to an appetitive cue prior to surgery, marmosets with
excitotoxic amygdala lesions failed to display such conditioned autonomic arousal
at retention, but still displayed intact cue-directed conditioned behaviours. In 
contrast, 5,7-DHT infusions into the amygdala, reducing extracellular 5-HT
levels, selectively enhanced the expression of appetitive conditioned behaviour
at retention. Similar infusions into the OFC, producing marked reductions in
post-mortem 5-HT tissue levels, had no overall effect on autonomic or behavioural
responses, either at retention or during reversal learning, but caused an
uncoupling of these responses, thereby fractionating emotional output. These data
demonstrate the critical role of the amygdala in the expression of appetitive
autonomic conditioning, and the region-selective contribution of 5-HT in the
amygdala and OFC, respectively, to the expression of conditioned behaviour and
the overall coordination of the emotional response. They provide insight into the
neurochemical mechanisms underlying the regulation of positive emotional
responses, advancing our understanding of the neural basis of pathologically
dysregulated emotion.

One of the most critical and common features of tool use is that the tool
essentially functions as a part of the body. This feature is likely rooted in
biological features that are shared by tool users. To establish an ideal primate 
model to explore the neurobiological mechanisms supporting tool-use behaviours,
we trained common marmosets, a small New World monkey species that is not usually
associated with tool use, to use a rake-shaped tool to retrieve food. Five naive 
common marmosets were systematically trained to manipulate the tool using a
4-stage, step-by-step protocol. The relative positions of the tool and the food
were manipulated, so that the marmosets were required to (1) pull the tool
vertically, (2) move the tool horizontally, (3) make an arc to retrieve a food
item located behind the tool and (4) retrieve the food item. We found
considerable individual differences in tool-use technique; for example, one
animal consistently used a unilateral hand movement for all of the steps, whereas
the others (n = 4) used both hands to move the tool depending on the location of 
the food item. After extensive training, all of the marmosets could manipulate
the rake-shaped tool, which is reported in this species for the first time. The
common marmoset is thus a model primate for such studies. This study sets the
stage for future research to examine the biological mechanisms underlying the
cognitive ability of tool use at the molecular and genetic levels.

Dengue virus (DENV) causes a wide range of illnesses in humans: dengue fever
(DF), dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Animal
models that constantly develop high levels of viraemia are required for the
development of protective and preventive measures. Common marmosets (Callithrix
jacchus) demonstrated high levels of viraemia after inoculation with clinical
isolates of four serotypes of DENV; in particular, over 10(6) genome copies
ml(-1) after inoculation with DENV-2. Non-structural protein 1 and DENV-specific 
IgM and IgG antibodies were consistently detected. The DENV-2 genome was detected
in lymphoid organs including the lymph nodes, spleen and thymus, and also in
non-lymphoid organs. DENV antigen was detected by immunohistochemistry in the
liver and spleen from inoculated marmosets. Four marmosets were reinoculated with
DENV-2 at 33 weeks after primary inoculation with DENV-2. The DENV-2 genome was
not detected in any of these marmosets, indicating protection from a secondary
infection. The results indicate that common marmosets are highly sensitive to
DENV infection, and suggest that marmosets could be a reliable primate model for 
the evaluation of candidate vaccines.

INTRODUCTION: In the State of Ceará, a new variant of the rabies virus was
identified associated with cases of human rabies transmitted by common marmosets 
(Callithrix jacchus), which are frequently kept as pets. This new variant does
not present antigenic proximity or genetic relationship to variants of the virus 
isolated from bats and terrestrial mammals from the American continent. The
present study aimed to evaluate the risk factors of rabies virus transmission
from common marmosets (C. jacchus) maintained as pets in the metropolitan region 
of Fortaleza, State of Ceará, Brazil, to human beings.
METHODS: A questionnaire focusing on animal management and interaction between
humans and primates was applied to individuals who had marmosets in the
municipalities of Aquiraz and Maranguape. In order to evaluate the presence of
rabies antigens by direct immunofluorescence test (DIF), samples of saliva were
collected from domiciliary captive marmosets. Based on the detection of rabies
antigens, biopsy samples of central nervous system (CNS) were analyzed.
RESULTS: Analysis of questionnaire data verified that a close relation exists
between humans and their pet marmosets, especially during management practices.
Additionally, these people showed minimal knowledge regarding rabies, which
represents a greater risk of infection. Of the 29 saliva samples evaluated, one
(3.4%) was positive for DIF reaction and of the 11 CNS samples, three (27.3%)
were positive.
CONCLUSIONS: Laboratory data are in agreement with the questionnaire findings,
which confirm an increased risk of rabies virus transmission due to the close
relation between humans and marmosets.

The frequency resolution of neurons throughout the ascending auditory pathway is 
important for understanding how sounds are processed. In many animal studies, the
frequency tuning widths are about 1/5th octave wide in auditory nerve fibers and 
much wider in auditory cortex neurons. Psychophysical studies show that humans
are capable of discriminating far finer frequency differences. A recent study
suggested that this is perhaps attributable to fine frequency tuning of neurons
in human auditory cortex (Bitterman Y, Mukamel R, Malach R, Fried I, Nelken I.
Nature 451: 197-201, 2008). We investigated whether such fine frequency tuning
was restricted to human auditory cortex by examining the frequency tuning width
in the awake common marmoset monkey. We show that 27% of neurons in the primary
auditory cortex exhibit frequency tuning that is finer than the typical frequency
tuning of the auditory nerve and substantially finer than previously reported
cortical data obtained from anesthetized animals. Fine frequency tuning is also
present in 76% of neurons of the auditory thalamus in awake marmosets. Frequency 
tuning was narrower during the sustained response compared to the onset response 
in auditory cortex neurons but not in thalamic neurons, suggesting that
thalamocortical or intracortical dynamics shape time-dependent frequency tuning
in cortex. These findings challenge the notion that the fine frequency tuning of 
auditory cortex is unique to human auditory cortex and that it is a de novo
cortical property, suggesting that the broader tuning observed in previous animal
studies may arise from the use of anesthesia during physiological recordings or
from species differences.

The pattern of myelination over the cerebral cortex, termed myeloarchitecture, is
an established and often-used feature to visualize cortical organization with
histology in a variety of primate species. In this paper, we use in vivo magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) and advanced image processing using surface rendering to 
visualize and characterize myeloarchitecture in a small nonhuman primate, the
common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). Through images made in four female adult
marmosets, we produce a representative 3D map of marmoset myeloarchitecture and
flatten and annotate this map to show the location and extent of a variety of
major areas of the cortex, including the primary visual, auditory, and
somatosensory areas. By treating our MRI data as a surface, we can measure the
surface area of cortical areas, and we present these measurements here to
summarize cortical organization in the marmoset.

Adult neurogenesis in the primate brain is generally accepted to occur primarily 
in two specific areas; the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the hippocampal dentate
gyrus (DG) and the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricles.
Hippocampal neurogenesis is well known to be downregulated by stress and aging in
rodents, however there is less evidence documenting the sensitivity of
neuroblasts generated in the SVZ. In primates, migrating cells generated in the
SVZ travel via a unique temporal stream (TS) to the amygdala and entorhinal
cortex. Using adult common marmoset monkeys (Callithrix jacchus), we examined
whether i) adult-generated cells in the marmoset amygdala differentiate into
doublecortin-positive (DCX+) neuroblasts, and ii) whether lasting changes occur
in DCX-expressing cells in the DG or amygdala when animals are exposed to 2 weeks
of psychosocial stress. A surprisingly large population of DCX+ immature neurons 
was found in the amygdala of these 4-year-old monkeys with an average density of 
163,000 DCX+ cells per mm(3). Co-labeling of these highly clustered cells with
PSA-NCAM supports that a subpopulation of these cells are migratory and
participate in chain-migration from the SVZ to the amygdala in middle-aged
marmosets. Exposure to 2 weeks of isolation and social defeat stress failed to
alter the numbers of BrdU+, or DCX+ cells in the hippocampus or amygdala when
evaluated 2 weeks after psychosocial stress, indicating that the current stress
paradigm has no long-term consequences on neurogenesis in this primate.

Hormonal and behavioral responses to stress in lactating and non-lactating female
common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus).

Saltzman W(1), Abbott DH.

States. Saltzman@ucr.edu

In several mammalian species, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) and behavioral
responses to stressors are down-regulated in lactating females, possibly
preventing stress-induced disruptions of maternal care. Experimental elevations
of HPA axis hormones have been found to inhibit maternal behavior in lactating
common marmoset monkeys (Callithrix jacchus), raising the question of whether
lactating female marmosets also have blunted endogenous responses to stress.
Therefore, we compared HPA and behavioral responses to standardized stressors in 
reproductively experienced female common marmosets that were undergoing ovulatory
cycles and that either were (N=7) or were not lactating (N=8). Each marmoset
underwent (1) a restraint stressor during the early follicular phase of the
ovarian cycle (approximately 5 weeks postpartum for lactating females) and (2)
exposure to a simulated hawk predator during the early to mid-luteal phase
(approximately 7 weeks postpartum for lactating females). Lactating females were 
tested in the presence of one of their infants. Blood samples were collected
before, during, and immediately after each test for determination of plasma
adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol concentrations. Both stressors
caused significant elevations in plasma ACTH and cortisol levels, and significant
decreases in cortisol:ACTH ratios; however, lactating and non-lactating females
showed no significant differences in their endocrine or behavioral responses to
either stressor, or in baseline ACTH or cortisol levels. These findings suggest
that in contrast to several other mammalian species, lactating female marmosets
maintain full behavioral and HPA responsiveness to stress, at least in the
presence of their infants.

Stress can inhibit maternal behaviour and increase rates of child abuse in humans
and other animals; however, the neuroendocrine mechanisms are not known. To
determine whether corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) plays a role in
stress-induced disruption of maternal behaviour in primates, we characterised the
effects of acute i.c.v. infusions of CRH on maternal and abusive behaviour in
common marmoset monkeys (Callithrix jacchus). Nulliparous females were implanted 
with indwelling i.c.v. guide cannulae before conception. Between 18 and 58 days
after the birth of her first infants, each female underwent a series of i.c.v.
infusions of human CRH (0, 2, 8 and 25 μg) in 8 μl of artificial cerebrospinal
fluid. In the 70 min after infusion, marmosets were tested with one of their
infants, first in their home cage and, subsequently, in an unfamiliar cage in
which the infant was confined in a transparent box on the cage floor. In the home
cage, the highest dose of CRH significantly reduced the amount of time that
mothers spent carrying their infants, as compared to vehicle alone, although it
did not reliably affect aggression toward the infant or other behaviours. In the 
confined-infant test, the highest dose of CRH significantly reduced the amount of
time that mothers spent on the cage floor, increased mothers' vocalisation rates,
and tended to reduce their activity levels and time spent in proximity to their
infant. Twenty-five micrograms of CRH also elicited significant elevations in
plasma adrenocorticotrophic hormone and cortisol concentrations compared to
vehicle. These results indicate that i.c.v.-administered CRH reduces maternal
behaviour in marmoset mothers, in both familiar and unfamiliar environments, but 
does not increase infant abuse.

Handedness has been widely studied in nonhuman primates. However, few studies
investigate this behavior throughout ontogenetic development. To determine the
influence of developmental stage in common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) females,
we used six animals, which were observed in food-reaching tests involving
hand-use preference from the infantile to the adult phase. During this period,
fecal samples were collected for sexual hormone analysis (estrogen and
progesterone). The results point to correlations between age and stabilization of
manual preference across the developmental phases. A relationship between
progesterone and the intensity of hand use asymmetry was observed during the
pubertal period, when the data was grouped into three phases: prepubertal,
pubertal, and postpubertal. These data show increasing strength of hand
preference during ontogenetic development and that sexual hormones may be
involved in females.

The aim of this study was to compare the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of
ciprofloxacin as post-exposure therapy against inhalational anthrax in the common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) with other non-human primate models in order to
determine whether the marmoset is a suitable model to test post-exposure
therapies for anthrax. Pharmacokinetic (PK) and efficacy studies with
ciprofloxacin were performed in the marmoset. Ciprofloxacin plasma
pharmacokinetics were determined in six animals in separate single-dose and
multiple-dose studies and were analysed by high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC). A separate group of marmosets was exposed to ca. 100× the 50% lethal dose
(LD(50)) of Bacillus anthracis Ames strain by the airborne route. On Day 5 of a
twice-daily dosing regimen of 17.5 mg/kg, the ciprofloxacin half-life (t(1/2)),
maximum drug concentration (C(max)) and area under the concentration-time curve
(AUC) in marmoset plasma were 1.9 h, 2.1 μg/mL and 7.9 μg/mL/h, respectively.
Naïve untreated control animals succumbed to infection by Day 9. All animals
treated with ciprofloxacin, started on the day of exposure and continued for 10
days, remained healthy during the treatment period. Two antibiotic-treated
animals (33%) died after withdrawal of antibiotic therapy, attributed to the
germination of residual spores. In conclusion, in many respects the marmoset
appears to respond to B. anthracis in a similar way to the macaque, suggesting
that this small non-human primate is an acceptable, practical alternative model
for the evaluation of medical countermeasures against respiratory anthrax
infection.

Characterization of BCAR4, a novel oncogene causing endocrine resistance in human
breast cancer cells.

Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.

Resistance to the antiestrogen tamoxifen remains a major problem in the
management of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. Knowledge on the
resistance mechanisms is needed to develop more effective therapies. Breast
cancer antiestrogen resistance 4 (BCAR4) was identified in a functional screen
for genes involved in tamoxifen resistance. BCAR4 is expressed in 27% of primary 
breast tumors. In patients treated with tamoxifen for metastized disease high
BCAR4 mRNA levels are associated with reduced clinical benefit and
progression-free survival. Regarding tumor aggressiveness high BCAR4 mRNA levels 
are associated with a shorter metastasis free survival and overall survival. In
the present study, we investigated the role of BCAR4 in endocrine resistance.
Forced expression of BCAR4 in human ZR-75-1 and MCF7 breast cancer cells resulted
in cell proliferation in the absence of estrogen and in the presence of various
antiestrogens. Inhibition of estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) expression with small
interfering RNA (siRNA), implied that the BCAR4-induced mechanism of resistance
is independent of ESR1. Highly conserved BCAR4 homologues of rhesus monkey, green
monkey, and the less conserved common marmoset gene induced tamoxifen-resistant
cell proliferation, in contrast to the distant BCAR4 homologues of bovine and
rabbit. Injection of BCAR4-expressing ZR-75-1 cells into nude mice resulted in
rapidly growing tumors. In silico analysis showed that BCAR4 mRNA is highly
expressed in human placenta and oocyte, and absent in other normal tissues. In
conclusion, BCAR4 is a strong transforming gene causing estrogen-independent
growth and antiestrogen resistance, and induces tumor formation in vivo. Due to
its restricted expression, BCAR4 may be a good target for treating
antiestrogen-resistant breast cancer.

Common marmoset monkeys (Callithrix jacchus) have emerged as important animal
models for biomedical research, necessitating a more extensive characterization
of their major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region. However, the genomic
information of the marmoset MHC (Caja) is still lacking. The MHC-B/C segment
represents the most diverse MHC region among primates. Therefore, in this paper, 
to elucidate the detailed gene organization and evolutionary processes of the
Caja class I B (Caja-B) segment, we determined two parts of the Caja-B sequences 
with 1,079 kb in total, ranging from H6orf15 to BAT1 and compared the structure
and phylogeny with that of other primates. This segment contains 54 genes in
total, nine Caja-B genes (Caja-B1 to Caja-B9), two MIC genes (MIC1 and MIC2),
eight non-MHC genes, two non-coding genes, and 33 non-MHC pseudogenes that have
not been observed in other primate MHC-B/C segments. Caja-B3, Caja-B4, and
Caja-B7 encode proper MHC class I proteins according to amino acid structural
characteristics. Phylogenetic relationships based on 48 MHC-I nucleotide
sequences in primates suggested (1) species-specific divergence for Caja, Mamu,
and HLA/Patr/Gogo lineages, (2) independent generation of the "seven coding exon"
type MHC-B genes in Mamu and HLA/Patr/Gogo lineages from an ancestral "eight
coding exon" type MHC-I gene, (3) parallel correlation with the long and short
segmental duplication unit length in Caja and Mamu lineages. These findings
indicate that the MHC-B/C segment has been under permanent selective pressure in 
the evolution of primates.

Spermatozoa are transcriptionally inactive cells, but contain acetylated
histones, normally a characteristic of transcriptionally active cells.
Acetylgroups are thought to represent epigenetic marks that are transmitted to
the oocyte and are involved in starting gene expression in the zygote and in
regulating gene expression during early embryogenesis. We performed reverse
transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in the common marmoset monkey
(Callithrix jacchus) and in bovine spermatozoa, oocytes, zygotes, two- and
four-cell embryos to evaluate the presence of specific transcripts known to play 
a role during fertilisation and early embryo development, namely protamine-1
(PRM1), protamine-2 (PRM2), histone H1 (H1), histone H3 (H3), histone H4 (H4),
cAMP-responsive element modulator (CREM), DNA methyltransferase-1 (DNMT1), TATA
box-binding protein (TBP). All transcripts tested were present in spermatozoa of 
the common marmoset, while bull spermatozoa lack PRM2. Marmoset oocytes exhibited
transcripts for H1, H3, H4 and TBP, whereas bovine oocytes revealed H1, H3, H4,
CREM, DNMT and TBP mRNAs. In zygotes, we amplified H1, H4, TBP (marmoset) and
PRM1, H1, H3, H4, CREM, DNMT1 and TBP (bovine). Two-cell embryos showed PCR
products for H1, H3 and TBP in the marmoset. In the bovine, all transcripts could
be observed except PRM2. In four-cell embryos, PCR signals were obtained for
PRM1, H1, H3, H4 and TBP in the marmoset. In the bovine, all transcripts were
detected except PRM2. Our data suggest that, in both C. jacchus and Bos taurus,
PRM1 transcripts are delivered by the spermatozoon to the oocyte.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is poised to become a standard nonhuman 
primate aging model. With an average lifespan of 5 to 7 years and a maximum
lifespan of 16½ years, marmosets are the shortest-lived anthropoid primates. They
display age-related changes in pathologies that mirror those seen in humans, such
as cancer, amyloidosis, diabetes, and chronic renal disease. They also display
predictable age-related differences in lean mass, calf circumference, circulating
albumin, hemoglobin, and hematocrit. Features of spontaneous sensory and
neurodegenerative change--for example, reduced neurogenesis, ß-amyloid deposition
in the cerebral cortex, loss of calbindin D(28k) binding, and evidence of
presbycusis--appear between the ages of 7 and 10 years. Variation among colonies 
in the age at which neurodegenerative change occurs suggests the interesting
possibility that marmosets could be specifically managed to produce earlier
versus later occurrence of degenerative conditions associated with differing
rates of damage accumulation. In addition to the established value of the
marmoset as a model of age-related neurodegenerative change, this primate can
serve as a model of the integrated effects of aging and obesity on metabolic
dysfunction, as it displays evidence of such dysfunction associated with high
body weight as early as 6 to 8 years of age.

Genes of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) have a wide variety of cellular
activities. In this study, we investigated molecular evolution of IgSF genes in
primates by comparing orthologous sequences of 249 IgSF genes among human,
chimpanzee, orangutan, rhesus macaque, and common marmoset. To evaluate the
non-synonymous/synonymous substitution ratio (ω), we applied Bn-Bs program and
PAML program. IgSF genes were classified into 11 functional categories based on
the Gene Ontology (GO) database. Among them, IgSF genes in three functional
categories, immune system process (GO:0002376), defense response (GO:0006952),
and multi-organism process (GO:0051704), which are tightly linked to the
regulation of immune system had much higher values of ω than genes in the other
GO categories. In addition, we estimated the average values of ω for each primate
lineage. Although each primate lineage had comparable average values of ω, the
human lineage showed the lowest ω value for the immune-related genes.
Furthermore, 11 IgSF genes, SIGLEC5, SLAMF6, CD33, CD3E, CEACAM8, CD3G, FCER1A,
CD48, CD4, TIM4, and FCGR2A, were implied to have been under positive selective
pressure during the course of primate evolution. Further sequence analyses of
CD3E and CD3G from 23 primate species suggested that the Ig domains of CD3E and
CD3G underwent the positive Darwinian selection.

The common marmoset is a small, arboreal, New World primate that has emerged as a
promising non-human model system in auditory neuroscience. A complete
understanding of the neuroethology of auditory processing in marmosets will
include behavioral work examining how sounds are perceived by these animals.
However, there have been few studies of the marmoset's hearing and perceptual
abilities and the audiogram of this species has not been measured using modern
psychophysical methods. The present experiment pairs psychophysics with an
operant conditioning technique to examine perception of pure tone stimuli by
marmosets using an active behavioral paradigm. Subjects were trained to lick at a
feeding tube when they detected a sound. Correct responses provided access to a
food reward. Pure tones of varying intensities were presented to subjects using
the method of constant stimuli. Behavioral thresholds were calculated for each
animal based on hit rate--threshold was defined by the tone intensity that the
animal correctly identified 50% of the time. Results show that marmoset hearing
is comparable to that of other New World monkeys, with a hearing range extending 
from about 125 Hz up to 36 kHz and a sensitivity peak around 7 kHz.

In 2009, we reported an online brain atlas of the common marmoset (Callithrix
jacchus) at http://marmoset-brain.org:2008. Here we report new digital images of 
the primate spinal cord sections added to the website. We prepared histological
sections of every segment of the spinal cord of the common marmoset, rhesus
monkey and Japanese monkey with various staining techniques. The sections were
scanned with Carl Zeiss MIRAX SCAN at light microscopic resolution. Obtained
digital data were processed and converted into multi-resolutionary images with
Adobe Photoshop and Zoomify Design. These images of the primate spinal cords are 
now available on the web via the Internet.

The adult subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricle contains neural stem
cells. In rodents, these cells generate neuroblasts that migrate as chains toward
the olfactory bulb along the rostral migratory stream (RMS). The neural-stem-cell
niche at the ventricular wall is conserved in various animal species, including
primates. However, it is unclear how the SVZ and RMS organization in nonhuman
primates relates to that of rodents and humans. Here we studied the SVZ and RMS
of the adult and neonatal common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a New World
primate used widely in neuroscience, by electron microscopy, and
immunohistochemical detection of cell-type-specific markers. The marmoset SVZ
contained cells similar to type B, C, and A cells of the rodent SVZ in their
marker expression and morphology. The adult marmoset SVZ had a three-layer
organization, as in the human brain, with ependymal, hypocellular, and
astrocyte-ribbon layers. However, the hypocellular layer was very thin or absent 
in the adult-anterior and neonatal SVZ. Anti-PSA-NCAM staining of the anterior
SVZ in whole-mount ventricular wall preparations of adult marmosets revealed an
extensive network of elongated cell aggregates similar to the neuroblast chains
in rodents. Time-lapse recordings of marmoset SVZ explants cultured in Matrigel
showed the neuroblasts migrating in chains, like rodent type A cells. These
results suggest that some features of neurogenesis and neuronal migration in the 
SVZ are common to marmosets, humans, and rodents. This basic description of the
adult and neonatal marmoset SVZ will be useful for future studies on adult
neurogenesis in primates.

Due to global industrialization, the light cycle is shifting to longer daytime.
Mounting evidence indicates that social developmental disorders may correlate
with longer periods of daytime in childhood. However, the exact mechanisms of
this link remain unclear. To examine the impact of longer day-time on
psychosocial development, we developed a novel non-human primate model, using the
common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) reared under constant daylight from birth.
Marmosets were reared individually by human nursing under constant light (LL)
during varying periods in juvenile development, and their behaviors were compared
with those of normal day-night cycle (LD) marmosets by multivariate analysis
based on principal component analysis (PCA). LL marmosets elicited egg-like calls
(e-call) less in juvenile period, and displayed side-to-side shakes of the upper 
body with rapid head rotation through adulthood frequently. Based on the PCA,
these behaviors were interpreted as 'alert' or 'hyperactive' states.
Additionally, behavioral development of marmosets reared under constant dark (DD)
was markedly different from both LD and LL marmosets, suggesting the fundamental 
importance of daylight-dependent neuronal and endocrine processes and entrainment
by a constant 24-hour light/dark cycle on psychosocial behavior development.

Free oligosaccharides are abundant components of mammalian milk and have primary 
roles as prebiotic compounds, in immune defense, and in brain development. A mass
spectrometry-based technique is applied to profile milk oligosaccharides from
apes (chimpanzee, gorilla, and siamang), new world monkeys (golden lion tamarin
and common marmoset), and an old world monkey (rhesus). The purpose of this study
is to evaluate the patterns of primate milk oligosaccharide composition from a
phylogenetic perspective to assess the extent to which the compositions of HMOs
derives from ancestral primate patterns as opposed to more recent evolutionary
events. Milk oligosaccharides were quantitated by nanoflow liquid chromatography 
on chip-based devices. The relative abundances of fucosylated and sialylated milk
oligosaccharides in primates were also determined. For a systematic and
comprehensive study of evolutionary patterns of milk oligosaccharides, cluster
analysis of primate milk was performed using the chromatographic profile. In
general, the oligosaccharides in primate milk, including humans, are more complex
and exhibit greater diversity compared to the ones in nonprimate milk. A detailed
comparison of the oligosaccharides across evolution revealed nonsequential
developmental pattern, that is, that primate milk oligosaccharides do not
necessarily cluster according to the primate phylogeny. This report represents
the first comprehensive and quantitative effort to profile and elucidate the
structures of free milk oligosaccharides so that they can be related to glycan
function in different primates.

BACKGROUND: Several recent studies have highlighted the important role of
immunity-related molecules in synaptic plasticity processes in the developing and
adult mammalian brains. It has been suggested that neuronal MHCI (major
histocompatibility complex class I) genes play a role in the refinement and
pruning of synapses in the developing visual system. As a fast evolutionary rate 
may generate distinct properties of molecules in different mammalian species, we 
studied the expression of MHCI molecules in a nonhuman primate, the common
marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus).
METHODS AND RESULTS: Analysis of expression levels of MHCI molecules in the
developing visual cortex of the common marmoset monkeys revealed a distinct
spatio-temporal pattern. High levels of expression were detected very early in
postnatal development, at a stage when synaptogenesis takes place and ocular
dominance columns are formed. To determine whether the expression of MHCI
molecules is regulated by retinal activity, animals were subjected to monocular
enucleation. Levels of MHCI heavy chain subunit transcripts in the visual cortex 
were found to be elevated in response to monocular enucleation. Furthermore, MHCI
heavy chain immunoreactivity revealed a banded pattern in layer IV of the visual 
cortex in enucleated animals, which was not observed in control animals. This
pattern of immunoreactivity indicated that higher expression levels were
associated with retinal activity coming from the intact eye.
CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that, in the nonhuman primate brain,
expression of MHCI molecules is regulated by neuronal activity. Moreover, this
study extends previous findings by suggesting a role for neuronal MHCI molecules 
during synaptogenesis in the visual cortex.

School of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University Baltimore, MD, USA.

All non-human primates communicate with conspecifics using vocalizations, a
system involving both the production and perception of species-specific vocal
signals. Much of the work on the neural basis of primate vocal communication in
cortex has focused on the sensory processing of vocalizations, while relatively
little data are available for vocal production. Earlier physiological studies in 
squirrel monkeys had shed doubts on the involvement of primate cortex in vocal
behaviors. The aim of the present study was to identify areas of common marmoset 
(Callithrix jacchus) cortex that are potentially involved in vocal communication.
In this study, we quantified cFos expression in three areas of marmoset cortex - 
frontal, temporal (auditory), and medial temporal - under various vocal
conditions. Specifically, we examined cFos expression in these cortical areas
during the sensory, motor (vocal production), and sensory-motor components of
vocal communication. Our results showed an increase in cFos expression in
ventrolateral prefrontal cortex as well as the medial and lateral belt areas of
auditory cortex in the vocal perception condition. In contrast, subjects in the
vocal production condition resulted in increased cFos expression only in dorsal
premotor cortex. During the sensory-motor condition (antiphonal calling),
subjects exhibited cFos expression in each of the above areas, as well as
increased expression in perirhinal cortex. Overall, these results suggest that
various cortical areas outside primary auditory cortex are involved in primate
vocal communication. These findings pave the way for further physiological
studies of the neural basis of primate vocal communication.

There is a critical need for animal models to study aspects type 2 diabetes (T2D)
pathogenesis and prevention. While the rhesus macaque is such an established
model, the common marmoset has added benefits including reduced zoonotic risks,
shorter life span, and a predisposition to birth twins demonstrating chimerism.
The marmoset as a model organism for the study of metabolic syndrome has not been
fully evaluated. Marmosets fed high-fat or glucose-enriched diets were followed
longitudinally to observe effects on morphometric and metabolic measures. Effects
on pancreatic histomorphometry and vascular pathology were examined terminally.
The glucose-enriched diet group developed an obese phenotype and a prolonged
hyperglycemic state evidenced by a rapid and persistent increase in mean
glycosylated hemoglobin (HgbA1c) observed as early as week 16. In contrast,
marmosets fed a high-fat diet did not maintain an obese phenotype and
demonstrated a delayed increase in HgbA1) that did not reach statistical
significance until week 40. Consumption of either diet resulted in profound
pancreatic islet hyperplasia suggesting a compensation for increased insulin
requirements. Although the high-fat diet group developed atherosclerosis of
increased severity, the presence of lesions correlated with glucose intolerance
only in the glucose-enriched diet group. The altered timing of glucose
dysregulation, differential contribution to obesity, and variation in vascular
pathology suggests mechanisms of effect specific to dietary nutrient content.
Feeding nutritionally modified diets to common marmosets recapitulates aspects of
metabolic disease and represents a model that may prove instrumental to
elucidating the contribution of nutrient excess to disease development.

Callithrix jacchus (common marmoset) is one of the more primitive non-human
primate species and is used widely in fundamental biology, pharmacology and
toxicology studies. Marmosets breed well in captivity with good reproductive
efficiencies and their sexual maturity is reached within 18 months of age
allowing for rapid expansion of colonies and early availability of sexually
mature animals permitting an earlier assessment of product candidates in the
adult. Their relatively small size allows a reduction in material requirements
leading to a reduction in development time and cost. Fewer animals are also
required due to their ability to be used in both pharmacology and toxicology
(nonclinical) studies. These factors, alongside a better understanding of their
optimal nutrient and welfare requirements over recent years, facilitate the
generation of a more cohesive and robust dataset. With the growth of
biotechnology-derived pharmaceuticals, non-human primate use has, by necessity,
also increased; nevertheless, there is also a growing public call for minimizing 
their use. Utilizing, the more primitive marmoset species may provide the optimal
compromise and once the scientific rationale has been carefully considered and
their use justified, there are several advantages to using the marmoset as a
model in nonclinical development of pharmaceutical products.

Olfactory cues can exert priming effects on many mammalian species. Paternally
experienced marmosets, Callithrix jacchus, exposed to direct isolated olfactory
contact with their own infant's scent show rapid decreases in testosterone levels
within 20 min, whereas paternally inexperienced males do not. The following study
tests whether there is a differential steroid response to exposure of infant
scent from dependent infants (own and novel) and independent infants (own and
novel). We examined the serum levels of estradiol, estrone, testosterone,
dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and combined estrogens and androgens in eight male
marmosets 20 min after exposure to isolated infant scent. Testosterone and
androgen levels combined were significantly lower with exposure to own infant
scent than a novel infant scent when the infants were at a dependent age but not 
at an independent age. Estrogen levels elevated significantly in response to own 
infant scent when the infants were at a dependent age but not at an independent
age. These results suggest that marmoset fathers are more responsive to priming
cues from related infants and hormonal responses from fathers are greatest when
the infant is at a dependent age.

Medicine, Mobile, AL 36688, USA.

Pituitary gonadotropins LH and FSH play central roles in reproductive function.
In Old World primates, LH stimulates ovulation in females and testosterone
production in males. Recent studies have found that squirrel monkeys and other
New World primates lack expression of LH in the pituitary. Instead, chorionic
gonadotropin (CG), which is normally only expressed in the placenta of Old World 
primates, is the active luteotropic pituitary hormone in these animals. The goal 
of this study was to investigate the tissue-specific regulation of squirrel
monkey CG. We isolated the squirrel monkey CGβ gene and promoter from genomic DNA
from squirrel monkey B-lymphoblasts and compared the promoter sequence to that of
the common marmoset, another New World primate, and human and rhesus macaque CGβ 
and LHβ. Using reporter gene assays, we found that a squirrel monkey CGβ promoter
fragment (-1898/+9) is active in both mouse pituitary LβT2 and human placenta
JEG3 cells, but not in rat adrenal PC12 cells. Furthermore, within this construct
separate cis-elements are responsible for pituitary- and placenta-specific
expression. Pituitary-specific expression is governed by Egr-1 binding sites in
the proximal 250 bp of the promoter, whereas placenta-specific expression is
controlled by AP-2 sites further upstream. Thus, selective expression of the
squirrel monkey CGβ promoter in pituitary and placental cells is governed by
distinct cis-elements that exhibit homology with human LHβ and marmoset CGβ
promoters, respectively.

Nonhuman primate embryonic stem (ES) cells have vast promise for preclinical
studies. Genetic modification in nonhuman primate ES cells is an essential
technique for maximizing the potential of these cells. The common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus), a nonhuman primate, is expected to be a useful transgenic
model for preclinical studies. However, genetic modification in common marmoset
ES (cmES) cells has not yet been adequately developed. To establish efficient and
stable genetic modifications in cmES cells, we inserted the enhanced green
fluorescent protein (EGFP) gene with heterotypic lox sites into the β-actin
(ACTB) locus of the cmES cells using gene targeting. The resulting knock-in ES
cells expressed EGFP ubiquitously under the control of the endogenous ACTB
promoter. Using inserted heterotypic lox sites, we demonstrated Cre
recombinase-mediated cassette exchange (RMCE) and successfully established a
monomeric red fluorescent protein (mRFP) knock-in cmES cell line. Further, a
herpes simplex virus-thymidine kinase (HSV-tk) knock-in cmES cell line was
established using RMCE. The growth of tumor cells originating from the cell line 
was significantly suppressed by the administration of ganciclovir. Therefore, the
HSV-tk/ganciclovir system is promising as a safeguard for stem cell therapy. The 
stable and ubiquitous expression of EGFP before RMCE enables cell fate to be
tracked when the cells are transplanted into an animal. Moreover, the creation of
a transgene acceptor locus for site-specific transgenesis will be a powerful
tool, similar to the ROSA26 locus in mice.

OBJECTIVE: To establish a nonhuman primate model addressing follicular
development in cryopreserved prepubertal ovarian tissue after xenografting.
DESIGN: Experimental study.
SETTING: Academic research center.
ANIMAL(S): Ovarian tissue from female prepubertal common marmoset (Callytrix
jacchus jacchus) grafted into immunodeficient nude mice (Crl:NU-FoxnI(nu)).
INTERVENTION(S): Removal and subsequent cryopreservation of ovarian tissues with 
dimethyl sulfoxide, followed by grafting to subcutaneous sites of ovariectomized 
and intact nude mice.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Histologic evaluation for the mean number of total and
morphologically normal follicles in each class.
RESULT(S): The mean number of unadvanced follicles in frozen-thawed grafted
ovarian tissues was reduced compared with pregraft controls, but the prevalence
of normal follicular morphology was either slightly increased (primordial
follicles) or unchanged (primary follicles). Previous ovariectomy in graft
recipients increased total follicle numbers without effect on normal follicular
morphology and shifted the ratio of primordial to primary follicles toward an
increase in primary follicles, indicating activation of follicular maturation.
CONCLUSION(S): The marmoset is a suitable primate model for studies on the
subsequent use of cryopreserved ovarian tissue, demonstrating graft sustainment
and the development of follicles from prepubertal ovarian tissue in
immunodeficient hosts up to secondary and preantral stages.

When play is a family business: adult play, hierarchy, and possible stress
reduction in common marmosets.

Norscia I(1), Palagi E.

Easy to recognize but not easy to define, animal play is a baffling behavior
because it has no obvious immediate benefits for the performers. However, the
absence of immediate advantages, if true, would leave adult play (costly but
maintained by evolution, spanning lemurs to Homo sapiens) unexplained. Although a
commonly held view maintains that play is limited by stress, an emergent
hypothesis states that play can regulate stress in the short term. Here we
explored this hypothesis in a captive family group of New World monkeys,
Callithrix jacchus (common marmoset). We observed six subjects and gathered data 
on aggressive, play, and scratching behavior via focal (6 h/individual) and all
occurrences sampling (115 h). We found that play levels were highest during
pre-feeding, the period of maximum anxiety due to the forthcoming competition
over food. Scratching (the most reliable indicator of stress in primates) and
play showed opposite trends along hierarchy, with dominants scratching more and
playing less than subordinates. Finally, scratching decreased after play, whereas
play appeared to be unrelated to previous scratching events, symptoms of a
potential stressful state. In conclusion, both play timing and hierarchical
distribution indicate that play limits stress, more than vice versa, at least in 
the short term.

Serotonin (5-HT) is involved in the fine adjustments at several brain centers
including the core of the mammal circadian timing system (CTS) and the
hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). The SCN receives massive serotonergic
projections from the midbrain raphe nuclei, whose inputs are described in rats as
ramifying at its ventral portion overlapping the retinohypothalamic and
geniculohypothalamic fibers. In the SCN, the 5-HT actions are reported as being
primarily mediated by the 5-HT1 type receptor with noted emphasis for 5-HT(1B)
subtype, supposedly modulating the retinal input in a presynaptic way. In this
study in a New World primate species, the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus),
we showed the 5-HT(1B) receptor distribution at the dorsal SCN concurrent with a 
distinctive location of 5-HT-immunoreactive fibers. This finding addresses to a
new discussion on the regulation and synchronization of the circadian rhythms in 
recent primates.

Advanced magnetic resonance (MR) neuroimaging analysis techniques based on
voxel-wise statistics, such as voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and functional MRI, 
are widely applied to cognitive brain research in both human subjects and in
non-human primates. Recent developments in imaging have enabled the evaluation of
smaller animal models with sufficient spatial resolution. The common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus), a small New World primate species, has been widely used in 
neuroscience research, to which voxel-wise statistics could be extended with a
species-specific brain template. Here, we report, for the first time, a
tissue-segmented, population-averaged standard template of the common marmoset
brain. This template was created by using anatomical T(1)-weighted images from 22
adult marmosets with a high-resolution isotropic voxel size of (0.2 mm)(3) at
7-Tesla and DARTEL algorithm in SPM8. Whole brain templates are available at
International Neuroinformatics Japan Node website,

BACKGROUND: Common marmoset monkeys (Callithrix jacchus) are readily used in
biomedical research. However, superovulation for embryonic stem cell production
and developmental research still remain difficult. Inexplicably,
follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) as key player in superovulation has to be
administered in extremely high dosages in this non-human primate compared to
human.
METHODS: To evaluate whether marmoset FSH (cjFSH) is functionally more competent 
than its human homologue on the marmoset FSH receptor (cjFSHR), we established in
vitro a homologous system characterizing homologous and recombinantly produced
cjFSH.
RESULTS: Upon stimulation of two cell lines stably expressing either the marmoset
or the human FSH receptor (cj/hFSHR), respectively, the second messenger
signaling of the activated receptor displayed no significant difference in ED(50)
values. Thermostability of cjFSH was significantly prolonged by roughly 20% on
both FSHRs.
CONCLUSION: High FSH dosage in marmoset superovulation cannot be explained by
enhanced biopotency of the natural animal's gonadotropin.

Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) are the most commonly used feeder cells for
pluripotent stem cells. However, autogeneic feeder (AF) cells have several
advantages such as no xenogeneic risks and reduced costs. In this report, we
demonstrate that common marmoset embryonic stem (cmES) cells can be maintained on
common marmoset AF (cmAF) cells. These cmES cells were maintained on cmAF cells
for 6 months, retaining their morphology, normal karyotype, and expression
patterns for the pluripotent markers Oct-3/4, Nanog, SSEA-3, SSEA-4, TRA-1-60,
and TRA-1-81, as well as their ability to differentiate into cardiac and neural
cells. Antibody array analysis revealed equivalent protein expression profiles
between cmES cells maintained on cmAF cells and MEFs. In addition, similarly
prepared human embryonic stem (hES) and induced pluripotent stem (hiPS)
cell-derived AF cells supported the growth of and maintained the morphology and
pluripotent marker expressions of hES and hiPS cells, respectively. DNA
microarray analysis revealed that these hES and hiPS cells had mRNA expression
profiles similar to those of hES and hiPS cells maintained on MEFs, respectively.
Taken together, these findings imply that AF cells can replace MEFs in the
routine maintenance of primate pluripotent stem cells.

Adult neurogenesis within the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the hippocampal dentate
gyrus and the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricle (LV) has been
most intensely studied within the brains of rodents such as mice and rats.
However, little is known about the cell types and processes involved in adult
neurogenesis within primates such as the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).
Moreover, substantial differences seem to exist between the neurogenic niche of
the LV between rodents and humans. Here, we set out to use immunohistochemical
and autogradiographic analysis to characterize the anatomy of the neurogenic
niches and the expression of cell type-specific markers in those niches in the
adult common marmoset brain. Moreover, we demonstrate significant differences in 
the activity of neurogenesis in the adult marmoset brain compared to the adult
mouse brain. Finally, we provide evidence for ongoing proliferation of
neuroblasts within both the SGZ and SVZ of the adult brain and further show that 
the age-dependent decline of neurogenesis in the hippocampus is associated with a
decrease in neuroblast cells.

    Arthritis Res Ther. 2010;12(6):148.

INTRODUCTION: There is an ever-increasing need for animal models to evaluate
efficacy and safety of new therapeutics in the field of rheumatoid arthritis
(RA). Particularly for the early preclinical evaluation of human-specific
biologicals targeting the progressive phase of the disease, there is a need for
relevant animal models. In response to this requirement we set out to develop a
model of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in a small-sized nonhuman primate
species (300 to 400 g at adult age); that is, the common marmoset (Callithrix
jacchus).
METHODS: Twenty-two animals divided into three experiments were immunized with
collagen type II (CII) of either bovine or chicken origin with different
immunization strategies. The animals were analyzed for clinical manifestation of 
arthritis, hematology and clinical chemistry, immunological responses against CII
and histopathological features of the arthritis.
RESULTS: Clinically manifest arthritis was observed in almost 100% (21 out of 22)
of the animals. Fifty percent of the animals developed semi-acute CIA while the
other 50% displayed a more chronic disease. Both cellular (CD3/CD4 and CD3/CD8)
and humoral responses (IgM and IgG) against CII were involved in the development 
of the disease. Besides mild histopathological changes in bone and cartilage,
severe inflammation in extraarticular tissues like periosteum and subcutaneous
tissues was observed.
CONCLUSIONS: This new model in marmosets more closely resembles chronic RA with
respect to the chronic disease course and pathomorphological presentation than
the more acute monophasic and destructive CIA model in macaques. This model can
therefore fill a niche in preclinical testing of new human specific therapeutics.

Primates often rely on vocal communication to mediate social interactions.
Although much is known about the acoustic structure of primate vocalizations and 
the social context in which they are usually uttered, our knowledge about the
neocortical control of audio-vocal interactions in primates is still incipient,
being mostly derived from lesion studies in squirrel monkeys and macaques. To map
the neocortical areas related to vocal control in a New World primate species,
the common marmoset, we employed a method previously used with success in other
vertebrate species: Analysis of the expression of the immediate early gene Egr-1 
in freely behaving animals. The neocortical distribution of Egr-1 immunoreactive 
cells in three marmosets that were exposed to the playback of conspecific
vocalizations and vocalized spontaneously (H/V group) was compared to data from
three other marmosets that also heard the playback but did not vocalize (H/n
group). The anterior cingulate cortex, the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and the 
ventrolateral prefrontal cortex presented a higher number of Egr-1 immunoreactive
cells in the H/V group than in H/n animals. Our results provide direct evidence
that the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, the region that comprises Broca's area 
in humans and has been associated with auditory processing of species-specific
vocalizations and orofacial control in macaques, is engaged during vocal output
in marmosets. Altogether, our results support the notion that the network of
neocortical areas related to vocal communication in marmosets is quite similar to
that of Old world primates. The vocal production role played by these areas and
their importance for the evolution of speech in primates are discussed.

The developmental impact of prenatal stress, prenatal dexamethasone and postnatal
social stress on physiology, behaviour and neuroanatomy of primate offspring:

RATIONALE: Exposure of the immature mammalian brain to stress factors, including 
stress levels of glucocorticoids, either prenatally or postnatally, is regarded
as a major regulatory factor in short- and long-term brain function and, in
human, as a major aetiological factor in neuropsychiatric disorders. Experimental
human studies are not feasible and animal studies are required to demonstrate
causality and elucidate mechanisms. A number of studies have been conducted and
reviewed in rodents but there are relatively few studies in primates.
OBJECTIVES: Here we present an overview of our published studies and some
original data on the effects of: (1) prenatal stress on
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) re/activity and hippocampus neuroanatomy in 
juvenile-adolescent rhesus macaques; (2) prenatal dexamethasone (DEX) on HPA
activity, behaviour and prefrontal cortex neuroanatomy in infant-adolescent
common marmosets; (3) postnatal daily parental separation stress on HPA
re/activity, behaviour, sleep and hippocampus and prefrontal cortex neuroanatomy 
in infant-adolescent common marmoset.
RESULTS: Prenatal stress increased basal cortisol levels and reduced neurogenesis
in macaque. Prenatal DEX was without effect on HPA activity and reduced social
play and skilled motor behaviour in marmoset. Postnatal social stress increased
basal cortisol levels, reduced social play, increased awakening and reduced
hippocampal glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptor expression in marmoset.
CONCLUSIONS: Perinatal stress-related environmental events exert short- and
long-term effects on HPA function, behaviour and brain status in rhesus macaque
and common marmoset. The mechanisms mediating the enduring effects remain to be
elucidated, with candidates including increased basal HPA function and epigenetic
programming.

Ocular wavefront aberrations in the common marmoset Callithrix jacchus: effects
of age and refractive error.

The common marmoset, Callithrix jacchus, is a primate model for emmetropization
studies. The refractive development of the marmoset eye depends on visual
experience, so knowledge of the optical quality of the eye is valuable. We report
on the wavefront aberrations of the marmoset eye, measured with a clinical
Hartmann-Shack aberrometer (COAS, AMO Wavefront Sciences). Aberrations were
measured on both eyes of 23 marmosets whose ages ranged from 18 to 452 days.
Twenty-one of the subjects were members of studies of emmetropization and
accommodation, and two were untreated normal subjects. Eleven of the 21
experimental subjects had worn monocular diffusers and 10 had worn binocular
spectacle lenses of equal power. Monocular deprivation or lens rearing began at
about 45 days of age and ended at about 108 days of age. All refractions and
aberration measures were performed while the eyes were cyclopleged; most
aberration measures were made while subjects were awake, but some control
measurements were performed under anesthesia. Wavefront error was expressed as a 
seventh-order Zernike polynomial expansion, using the Optical Society of
America's naming convention. Aberrations in young marmosets decreased up to about
100 days of age, after which the higher-order RMS aberration leveled off to about
0.10 μm over a 3 mm diameter pupil. Higher-order aberrations were 1.8 times
greater when the subjects were under general anesthesia than when they were
awake. Young marmoset eyes were characterized by negative spherical aberration.
Form-deprived eyes of the monocular deprivation animals had greater wavefront
aberrations than their fellow untreated eyes, particularly for asymmetric
aberrations in the odd-numbered Zernike orders. Both lens-treated and
form-deprived eyes showed similar significant increases in Z3(-3) trefoil
aberration, suggesting the increase in trefoil may be related to factors that do 
not involve visual feedback.

Late B cell depletion with a human anti-human CD20 IgG1κ monoclonal antibody
halts the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in marmosets.

Depletion of CD20(+) B cells has been related to reduced clinical activity in
relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. The underlying mechanism is not
understood, because serum IgG levels were unaltered by the treatment. We report
the effect of late B cell depletion on cellular and humoral immune mechanisms in 
a preclinical multiple sclerosis model (i.e., experimental autoimmune
encephalomyelitis [EAE] in the common marmoset). We used a novel human anti-human
CD20 IgG1κ mAb (HuMab 7D8) that cross-reacts with marmoset CD20. EAE was induced 
in 14 marmosets by immunization with recombinant human myelin oligodendrocyte
glycoprotein (MOG) in CFA. After 21 d, B cells were depleted in seven monkeys by 
HuMab 7D8, and seven control monkeys received PBS. The Ab induced profound and
long-lasting B cell depletion from PBMCs and lymphoid organs throughout the
observation period of 106 d. Whereas all of the control monkeys developed
clinically evident EAE, overt neurologic deficits were reduced substantially in
three HuMab 7D8-treated monkeys, and four HuMab 7D8-treated monkeys remained
completely asymptomatic. The effect of HuMab 7D8 was confirmed on magnetic
resonance images, detecting only small lesions in HuMab 7D8-treated monkeys. The 
infusion of HuMab 7D8 arrested the progressive increase of anti-MOG IgG Abs.
Although CD3(+) T cell numbers in lymphoid organs were increased, their
proliferation and cytokine production were impaired significantly. Most notable
were the substantially reduced mRNA levels of IL-7 and proinflammatory cytokines 
(IL-6, IL-17A, IFN-γ, and TNF-α). In conclusion, B cell depletion prevents the
development of clinical and pathological signs of EAE, which is associated with
impaired activation of MOG-reactive T cells in lymphoid organs.

The seminiferous epithelium in the nonhuman primate Callithrix jacchus is
similarly organized to man. This monkey has therefore been used as a preclinical 
model for spermatogenesis and testicular stem cell physiology. However, little is
known about the developmental dynamics of germ cells in the postnatal primate
testis. In this study, we analyzed testes of newborn, 8-week-old, and adult
marmosets employing immunohistochemistry using pluripotent stem cell and germ
cell markers DDX4 (VASA), POU5F1 (OCT3/4), and TFAP2C (AP-2γ). Stereological and 
morphometric techniques were applied for quantitative analysis of germ cell
populations and testicular histological changes. Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) of
testicular mRNA was applied using 16 marker genes establishing the corresponding 
profiles during postnatal testicular development. Testis size increased during
the first 8 weeks of life with the main driver being longitudinal outgrowth of
seminiferous cords. The number of DDX4-positive cells per testis doubled between 
birth and 8 weeks of age whereas TFAP2C- and POU5F1-positive cells remained
unchanged. This increase in DDX4-expressing cells indicates dynamic growth of the
differentiated A-spermatogonial population. The presence of cells expressing
POU5F1 and TFAP2C after 8 weeks reveals the persistence of less differentiated
germ cells. The mRNA and protein profiles determined by qRT-PCR and western blot 
in newborn, 8-week-old, and adult marmosets corroborated the immunohistochemical 
findings. In conclusion, we demonstrated the presence of distinct spermatogonial 
subpopulations in the primate testis exhibiting different dynamics during early
testicular development. Our study demonstrates the suitability of the marmoset
testis as a model for human testicular development.

Although embryonic stem (ES) cell-like induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells have 
potential therapeutic applications in humans, they are also useful for creating
genetically modified human disease models in nonhuman primates. In this study, we
generated common marmoset iPS cells from fetal liver cells via the
retrovirus-mediated introduction of six human transcription factors: Oct-3/4,
Sox2, Klf4, c-Myc, Nanog, and Lin28. Four to five weeks after introduction,
several colonies resembling marmoset ES cells were observed and picked for
further expansion in ES cell medium. Eight cell lines were established, and
validation analyses of the marmoset iPS cells followed. We detected the
expression of ES cell-specific surface markers. Reverse transcription-PCR showed 
that these iPS cells expressed endogenous Oct-3/4, Sox2, Klf4, c-Myc, Nanog and
Lin28 genes, whereas all of the transgenes were silenced. Karyotype analysis
showed that two of three iPS cell lines retained a normal karyotype after a
2-month culture. Both embryoid body and teratoma formation showed that marmoset
iPS cells had the developmental potential to give rise to differentiated
derivatives of all three primary germ layers. In summary, we generated marmoset
iPS cells via the transduction of six transcription factors; this provides a
powerful preclinical model for studies in regenerative medicine.

Pharmacokinetic and efficacy studies with levofloxacin were performed in the
common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) model of inhalational tularemia. Plasma
levofloxacin pharmacokinetics were determined in six animals in separate
single-dose and multidose studies. Plasma drug concentrations were analyzed using
liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry-electrospray ionization. On day 7 
of a twice-daily dosing regimen of 40 mg/kg, the levofloxacin half-life, maximum 
concentration, and area under the curve in marmoset plasma were 2.3 h, 20.9
microg/ml, and 81.4 microg/liter/h, respectively. An efficacy study was
undertaken using eight treated and two untreated control animals. Marmosets were 
challenged with a mean of 1.5 x 10(2) CFU of Francisella tularensis by the
airborne route. Treated animals were administered 16.5 mg/kg levofloxacin by
mouth twice daily, based on the pharmacokinetic parameters, beginning 24 h after 
challenge. Control animals had a raised core body temperature by 57 h
postchallenge and died from infection by day 5. All of the other animals
survived, remained afebrile, and lacked overt clinical signs. No bacteria were
recovered from the organs of these animals at postmortem after culling at day 24 
postchallenge. In conclusion, postexposure prophylaxis with orally administered
levofloxacin was efficacious against acute inhalational tularemia in the common
marmoset. The marmoset appears to be an appropriate animal model for the
evaluation of postexposure therapies.

Brevity is not always a virtue in primate communication.

Semple et al. (Semple et al. in press, Biol. Lett. (doi:10.1098/rsbl.2009.1062)) 
argued that the 'law of brevity' (an inverse relationship between word length and
frequency of use) applies not only to human language but also to vocal signalling
in non-human primates, because coding efficiency is paramount in both situations.
We analysed the frequency of use of signals of different duration in the vocal
repertoires of two Neotropical primate species studied in the wild-the common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) and the golden-backed uakari (Cacajao
melanocephalus). The key prediction of the law of brevity was not supported in
either species: although the most frequently emitted calls were relatively brief,
they were not the shortest signals in the repertoire. The costs and benefits
associated with signals of different duration must be appreciated to understand
properly their frequency of use. Although relatively brief vocal signals may be
favoured by natural selection in order to minimize energetic costs, the very
briefest signals may be ambiguous, contain reduced information or be difficult to
detect or locate, and may therefore be selected against. Analogies between human 
language and vocal communication in animals can be misleading as a basis for
understanding frequency of use, because coding efficiency is not the only factor 
of importance in animal communication, and the costs and benefits associated with
different signal durations will vary in a species-specific manner.

Parent-offspring attachment is important for animals which have offspring that
require parental care for their development. Infant attachment to the mother has 
been examined in macaques, but it remains poorly understood in common marmosets. 
Here, we examined the abilities of 14 common marmoset infants to show preference 
for their parents over adults from another group at the ages of 4, 10, and
15 weeks. Each infant was exposed to its parent and an adult from another group
in an I-shaped maze. Although 4-week-old infants did not show a significant
difference between approach behaviors toward their parents and other adults, 10- 
and 15-week-old infants approached and stayed longer near their parents than
adults from another group. These results suggest selective approach behavior
develops in marmosets by the age of 10 weeks.

The intracellular Gram-negative pathogen Francisella tularensis is the causative 
agent of tularaemia and is prevalent in many countries in the northern
hemisphere. To determine whether the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) would
be a suitable non-human primate model of inhalational tularaemia, a
pathophysiology study was undertaken. Ten animals were challenged with
approximately 10(2) c.f.u. F. tularensis strain SCHU S4 (F. tularensis subsp.
tularensis). To look for trends in the infection, pairs of animals were
sacrificed at 24 h intervals between 0 and 96 h post-challenge and blood and
organs were assessed for bacteriology, pathology and haematological and
immunological parameters. The first indication of infection was a raised core
temperature at 3 days post-challenge. This coincided with a number of other
factors: a rapid increase in the number of bacteria isolated from all organs,
more pronounced gross pathology and histopathology, and an increase in the
immunological response. As the disease progressed, higher bacterial and cytokine 
levels were detected. More extensive pathology was observed, with multifocal
lesions seen in the lungs, liver and spleen. Disease progression in the common
marmoset appears to be consistent with human clinical and pathological features
of tularaemia, indicating that this may be a suitable animal model for the
investigation of novel medical interventions such as vaccines or therapeutics.

Vocalizations are a dominant means of communication for numerous species,
including nonhuman primates. These acoustic signals are encoded with a rich array
of information available to signal receivers that can be used to guide
species-typical behaviors. In this study, we examined the communicative content
of common marmoset phee calls, the species-typical long distance contact call,
during antiphonal calling. This call type has a relatively stereotyped acoustic
structure, consisting of a series of long tonal pulses. Analyses revealed that
calls could be reliably classified based on the individual identity and social
group of the caller. Our analyses did not, however, correctly classify phee calls
recorded under different social contexts, although differences were evident along
individual acoustic parameters. Further tests of antiphonal calling interactions 
showed that spontaneously produced phee calls differ from antiphonal phee calls
in their peak and end frequency, which may be functionally significant. Overall, 
this study shows that the marmoset phee call has a rich communicative content
encoded in its acoustic structure available to conspecifics during antiphonal
calling exchanges.

In the human, canonical histones are largely replaced by protamine 1 (P1) and
protamine 2 (P2) during late spermatogenesis. Recent studies have demonstrated
that abnormal replacement of the histones is associated with severe male
infertility and has profound implications for early embryogenesis. In this review
the hispid cotton rat and the common marmoset are evaluated as animal models for 
the study of chromatin packaging in sperm. The DNA sequences of protamine 1 and
protamine 2 in the cotton rat are also reported. We have found that the P1 and P2
genes share a 64% and 56% amino acid identity with human, respectively. The
hispid cotton rat expresses both protamines, has a similar P1:P2 ratio, and a
gene sequence homologous to human, thus making it a possible model organism for
chromatin studies. The common marmoset also expresses both protamine genes and
has a very similar spermatogenetic characteristic to man. This review considers
both animals as possible models to study the mechanisms of protamine regulation
and the effects of altered expression caused by environmental or physiological
perturbations.

The cellular distribution of SPP1, which we recently identified as a gene with
greater expression in the macaque primary motor cortex than in the premotor or
prefrontal cortices, was examined in rhesus macaque, common marmoset, and rat
brains. In situ hybridization histochemistry revealed that SPP1 mRNA was
expressed specifically in pyramidal neurons in layer V of the sensorimotor cortex
of the rhesus macaque. These SPP1 mRNA-positive neurons were most abundant in the
primary motor area, followed by Brodmann area 5 and the supplementary motor area,
in accordance with the distribution of corticospinal neurons. In addition,
injection of a retrograde neuroanatomical tracer into the lateral corticospinal
tract (CST) of the spinal cord caused labeling of SPP1 positive neurons,
indicating the expression of SPP1 in corticospinal neurons. SPP1 was also
expressed in the thalamus, brainstem, and spinal ventral horn of the rhesus
macaque. Although SPP1 was also detected in the brainstem and spinal cord of the 
marmoset and the rat, it was not detected in their cerebral cortices. Selective
expression in the corticospinal neurons of the sensorimotor cortex of the rhesus 
macaque suggests that SPP1 plays a critical role in the functional or structural 
specialization of highly developed corticospinal systems in certain primate
species.

PURPOSE: Converting inner retinal neurons to photosensitive cells by expressing
channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) offers a novel approach for treating blindness caused
by retinal degenerative diseases. In the present study, the recombinant
adeno-associated virus serotype 2 (rAAV2)-mediated expression and function of a
fusion construct of channelopsin-2 (Chop2) and green fluorescent protein (GFP)
(Chop2-GFP) were evaluated in the inner retinal neurons in the common marmoset
Callithrix jacchus.
METHODS: rAAV2 vectors carrying ubiquitous promoters were injected into the
vitreous chamber. Expression of Chop2-GFP and functional properties of ChR2 were 
examined by immunocytochemical and electrophysiological methods 3 months after
injection.
RESULTS: The percentage of Chop2-GFP-expressing cells in the ganglion cell layer 
was found to be retinal region- and animal age-dependent. The highest percentage 
was observed in the far-peripheral region. Chop2-GFP expression was also found in
the foveal and parafoveal region. In the peripheral retina in young animals with 
high viral concentrations, the expression of Chop2-GFP was observed in all major 
classes of retinal neurons, including all major types of ganglion cells. The
morphologic properties of Chop2-GFP-positive cells were normal for at least 3
months, and ChR2-mediated light responses were demonstrated by
electrophysiological recordings.
CONCLUSIONS: The rAAV2-mediated expression of ChR2 was observed in the inner
retinal neurons in the marmoset retina through intravitreal delivery. The
marmoset could be a valuable nonhuman primate model for developing ChR2-based
gene therapy for treating blinding retinal degenerative diseases.

A novel highly reproducible and lethal nonhuman primate model for orthopox virus 
infection.

The intentional re-introduction of Variola virus (VARV), the agent of smallpox,
into the human population is of great concern due its bio-terroristic potential. 
Moreover, zoonotic infections with Cowpox (CPXV) and Monkeypox virus (MPXV) cause
severe diseases in humans. Smallpox vaccines presently available can have severe 
adverse effects that are no longer acceptable. The efficacy and safety of new
vaccines and antiviral drugs for use in humans can only be demonstrated in animal
models. The existing nonhuman primate models, using VARV and MPXV, need very high
viral doses that have to be applied intravenously or intratracheally to induce a 
lethal infection in macaques. To overcome these drawbacks, the infectivity and
pathogenicity of a particular CPXV was evaluated in the common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus).A CPXV named calpox virus was isolated from a lethal
orthopox virus (OPV) outbreak in New World monkeys. We demonstrated that
marmosets infected with calpox virus, not only via the intravenous but also the
intranasal route, reproducibly develop symptoms resembling smallpox in humans.
Infected animals died within 1-3 days after onset of symptoms, even when very low
infectious viral doses of 5x10(2) pfu were applied intranasally. Infectious virus
was demonstrated in blood, saliva and all organs analyzed.We present the first
characterization of a new OPV infection model inducing a disease in common
marmosets comparable to smallpox in humans. Intranasal virus inoculation
mimicking the natural route of smallpox infection led to reproducible infection. 
In vivo titration resulted in an MID(50) (minimal monkey infectious dose 50%) of 
8.3x10(2) pfu of calpox virus which is approximately 10,000-fold lower than MPXV 
and VARV doses applied in the macaque models. Therefore, the calpox
virus/marmoset model is a suitable nonhuman primate model for the validation of
vaccines and antiviral drugs. Furthermore, this model can help study mechanisms
of OPV pathogenesis.

Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in the neotropical primate common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a relevant autoimmune animal model of multiple
sclerosis. T cells specific for peptide 34 to 56 of myelin/oligodendrocyte
glycoprotein (MOG34-56) have a central pathogenic role in this model. The aim of 
this study was to assess the requirement for innate immune stimulation for
activation of this core pathogenic autoimmune mechanism. Marmoset monkeys were
sensitized against synthetic MOG34-56 peptide alone or in combination with the
nonencephalitogenic peptide MOG74-96 formulated in incomplete Freund adjuvant,
which lacks microbial components. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis
development was recorded by monitoring neurological signs, brain magnetic
resonance imaging, and longitudinal profiling of cellular and humoral immune
parameters. All monkeys developed autoimmune inflammatory/demyelinating central
nervous system disease characterized by massive brain and spinal cord
demyelinating white matter lesions with activated macrophages and CD3+ T cells.
Immune profiling ex vivo demonstrated the activation of mainly CD3+CD4+/8+CD56+ T
cells against MOG34-56. Upon ex vivo stimulation, these T cells produced more
interleukin 17A compared with TH1 cytokines (e.g. interferon-gamma) and displayed
peptide-specific cytolytic activity. These results indicate that the full
spectrum of marmoset experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis can be induced by 
sensitization against a single MOG peptide in incomplete Freund adjuvant lacking 
microbial compounds for innate immune activation and by eliciting
antigen-specific T-cell cytolytic activity.

The androgen receptor (AR) is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, and
is important for both male and female reproductive health. The receptor is a
target for a number of post-translational modifications including
phosphorylation, which has been intensively studied in vitro. However, little is 
known about the phosphorylation status of the receptor in target tissues in vivo.
The common marmoset is a useful model for studying human reproductive functions, 
and comparison of the AR primary sequence from this primate shows high
conservation of serines known to be phosphorylated in the human receptor and
corresponding flanking amino acids. We have used a panel of phosphospecific
antibodies to study AR phosphorylation in the marmoset ovary throughout the
follicular phase and after treatment with GNRH antagonist or testosterone
propionate. In normal follicular phase ovaries, total AR (both phosphorylated and
non-phosphorylated forms) immunopositive staining was observed in several cell
types including granulosa cells of developing follicles, theca cells and
endothelial cells lining blood vessels. Receptor phosphorylation at serines 81,
308, and 650 was detected primarily in the granulosa cells of developing
follicles, surface epithelium, and vessel endothelial cells. Testosterone
treatment lead to a modest increase in AR staining in all stages of follicle
studied, while GNRH antagonist had no effect. Neither treatment significantly
altered the pattern of phosphorylation compared to the control group. These
results demonstrate that phosphorylation of the AR occurs, at a subset of serine 
residues, in a reproductive target tissue in vivo, which appears refractory to
hormonal manipulations.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is useful as a nonhuman primate model of
human diseases. Although the marmoset model has great potential for studying
autoimmune diseases and immune responses against pathogens, little information is
available regarding the genes involved in adaptive immunity. Here, we identified 
one TCR alpha constant (TRAC), 46 TRAJ (joining), and 35 TRAV (variable) segments
from marmoset cDNA. Marmoset TRAC, TRAJ, and TRAV shared 80%, 68-100%, and 79-98%
identity with their human counterparts at the amino acid level, respectively. The
amino acid sequences were less conserved in TRAC than in TCRbeta chain constant
(TRBC). Comparative analysis of TRAV between marmosets and humans showed that the
rates of synonymous substitutions per site (d(S)) were not significantly
different between the framework regions (FRs) and complementarity determining
regions (CDRs), whereas the rates of nonsynonymous substitutions per site (d(N)) 
were significantly lower in the FRs than in CDRs. Interestingly, the d(N) values 
of the CDRs were greater for TRBV than TRAV. These results suggested that after
the divergence of Catarrhini from Platyrrhini, amino acid substitutions were
decreased in the FRs by purifying selection and occurred more frequently in
CDRbeta than in CDRalpha by positive selection, probably depending on structural 
and functional constraints. This study provides not only useful information
facilitating the investigation of adaptive immunity using the marmoset model but 
also new insight into the molecular evolution of the TCR heterodimer in primate
species.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is unique among the primates in its
small body size, reproductive efficacy, and characteristic social behavior,
making it useful as an animal model in neuroscientific research. To assess the
brain serotonergic systems, we investigated the binding of
[(11)C]-3-amino-4-(2-dimetylaminomethyl-phenylsulfanyl)-benzonitrile
([(11)C]DASB) to brain serotonin transporter (SERT) in conscious common marmosets
using positron emission tomography (PET), and compared with findings for rhesus
monkeys. Both species showed globally similar distribution patterns of
[(11)C]DASB uptake in the brain, with highest activity in the midline of the
brain and lowest in the cerebellum, and higher activity in some subcortical
regions than in surrounding cortex, while the common marmoset brain showed almost
equal or rather higher binding potential (BP) values (BP(ND)) in cortical regions
and hippocampus, and lower BP(ND) than the rhesus monkey brain in some
subcortical regions. Test-retest reproducibility of BP(ND) at an interval of
several months was high, indicating reliable and stable measurements of serotonin
transporters in both species. These results suggest that SERT imaging by PET with
[(11)C]DASB under conscious state is valuable for investigating the physiological
serotonergic functions in common marmosets (182).

BACKGROUND: Synthetic glucocorticoids such as dexamethasone (DEX) are commonly
used to promote fetal lung maturation in at-risk preterm births, but there is
emerging evidence of subsequent neurobehavioral abnormalities in these children
e.g. problems with inattention/hyperactivity. However, molecular pathways
mediating effects of glucocorticoid overexposure on motor and cognitive
development are poorly understood.
METHODS: In this study with common marmoset monkeys, we investigated for neonatal
and adulthood effects of antenatal DEX treatment on the expression of the
corticosteroid receptors and also calcyon, a risk gene for
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, in the prefrontal cortex (PFC).
Pregnant marmosets were exposed to DEX (5 mg/kg body weight) or vehicle during
early (days 42-48) or late (days 90-96) stages of the 144-day pregnancy.
RESULTS: In neonates, relative to controls, glucocorticoid receptor (GR) mRNA
levels were significantly reduced after the late DEX treatment in the medial,
orbital and dorsal PFC and after the early DEX treatment in the dorsal PFC. The
early DEX exposure, specifically, resulted in significant reduction in calcyon
mRNA expression in the medial, orbital, dorsal and lateral PFC relative to
controls. Mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) mRNA levels were not significantly
affected by DEX treatment. In adults, PFC GR, calcyon, and MR mRNA levels were
not significantly affected by early or late prenatal DEX treatment.
CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that antenatal DEX treatment could lead to

Dopa decarboxylase inhibitors are routinely used to potentiate the effects of
L-DOPA in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. However, neither in clinical use 
nor in experimental models of Parkinson's disease have the timing and dose of
dopa decarboxylase inhibitors been thoroughly explored. We now report on the
choice of dopa decarboxylase inhibitors, dose and the time of dosing
relationships of carbidopa, benserazide and L-alpha-methyl dopa (L-AMD) in
potentiating the effects of L-DOPA in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6
tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated common marmoset. Pre-treatment with benserazide
for up to 3h did not alter the motor response to L-DOPA compared to simultaneous 
administration with L-DOPA. There was some evidence of a relationship between
carbidopa and benserazide dose and increased locomotor activity and the reversal 
of motor disability. But in general, commonly used dose levels of dopa
decarboxylase inhibitors appeared to produce a maximal motor response to L-DOPA. 
In contrast, dyskinesia intensity and duration continued to increase with both
carbidopa and benserazide dose. The novel dopa decarboxylase inhibitor, L-AMD,
increased locomotor activity and improved motor disability to the same extent as 
carbidopa or benserazide but importantly this was accompanied by significantly
less dyskinesia. This study shows that currently, dopa decarboxylase inhibitors
may be routinely employed in the MPTP-treated primate at doses which are higher
than those necessary to produce a maximal potentiation of the anti-parkinsonian
effect of L-DOPA. This may lead to excessive expression of dyskinesia in this
model of Parkinson's disease and attention should be given to the dose regimens
currently employed.

Several recent studies suggested a role for neuronal major histocompatibility
complex class I (MHCI) molecules in certain forms of synaptic plasticity in the
hippocampus of rodents. Here, we report for the first time on the expression
pattern and functional properties of MHCI molecules in the hippocampus of a
nonhuman primate, the common marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus). We detected a 
presynaptic, mossy fiber-specific localization of MHCI proteins within the
marmoset hippocampus. MHCI molecules were present in the large, VGlut1-positive, 
mossy fiber terminals, which provide input to CA3 pyramidal neurons. Furthermore,
whole-cell recordings of CA3 pyramidal neurons in acute hippocampal slices of the
common marmoset demonstrated that application of antibodies which specifically
block MHCI proteins caused a significant decrease in the frequency, and a
transient increase in the amplitude, of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic
currents (sEPSCs) in CA3 pyramidal neurons. These findings add to previous
studies on neuronal MHCI molecules by describing their expression and
localization in the primate hippocampus and by implicating them in
plasticity-related processes at the mossy fiber-CA3 synapses. In addition, our
results suggest significant interspecies differences in the localization of
neuronal MHCI molecules in the hippocampus of mice and marmosets, as well as in
their potential function in these species.

The CANTAB (Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery), a system
developed for human neuropsychological testing, has previously been used to
assess cognitive function in two species of nonhuman primates, common marmoset
monkeys and rhesus macaques. We describe the application of the system to the
juvenile baboon, a nonhuman primate species offering specific investigative
advantages. Juvenile baboons were trained and tested on a progressive ratio task 
to assess motivation, simple discrimination and simple reversal tasks to assess
associative learning, and intra- and extra-dimensional set-shifting tasks to
assess selective attention and attentional set-shifting, respectively. Study
subjects were 8 juvenile baboons (Papio sp.), 4 females and 4 males aged
3.0+/-0.1 (mean+SEM) years and weight 8.2+/-0.4 kg. All baboons were easily
trained, readily learned the neuropsychological tests and exhibited a stable
performance. Applying a method such as the CANTAB has significant implications
for expanding on the translational utility of the baboon in studies of
neurodevelopment.

Luteotrophic effects of relaxin, chorionic gonadotrophin and FSH in common
marmoset monkeys (Callithrix jacchus).

In early pregnant primates, relaxin (RLX) is highly upregulated within the corpus
luteum (CL), suggesting that RLX may have an important role in the implantation
of the blastocyst. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the
local effects of RLX and gonadotrophins on the maintenance of the CL using an in 
vitro microdialysis system. CLs of common marmoset monkeys were collected by
luteectomy during different stages of the luteal phase and early pregnancy. Each 
CL was perfused with either Ringer's solution alone or Ringer's solution
supplemented with either porcine RLX (250, 500 and 1000 ng/ml) or gonadotrophins 
(50 IU/ml). Application of RLX provoked a significant luteal response of
progesterone (P(4)) and oestradiol (E(2)) secretions during the mid-luteal phase 
(500 ng/ml: P(4) 54+/-42%, E(2) 24+/-11%; 1000 ng/ml: E(2) 16+/-13%), and
especially during the late luteal phase (250 ng/ml: P(4) 53+/-10%; 500 ng/ml:
P(4) 44+/-15%; 1000 ng/ml: P(4) 62+/-15%, E(2) 18+/-7%). The effects of RLX on
steroid secretion were irrespective of the RLX dosages. While treatment with
human chorionic gonadotrophin did not affect luteal steroid or RLX secretion, the
application of FSH resulted in a significant increase in the secretion of both
P(4) (20+/-8%) and E(2) (37+/-28%), and a prominent rise in RLX during early
pregnancy. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that RLX and FSH have a
luteotrophic function in the marmoset monkeys; moreover, FSH has a function
beyond its traditional role just as a follicle-stimulating hormone.

Pyridostigmine bromide (PB) was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) in 2003 as a pretreatment in humans against the lethal effects of the
irreversible nerve agent soman (GD). Organophosphate (OP) chemical warfare agents
such as GD exert their toxic effects by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase (AChE)
from terminating the action of acetylcholine at postsynaptic sites in cholinergic
nerve terminals (including crucial peripheral muscle such as diaphragm). As part 
of the post-marketing approval of PB, the FDA required (under 21CFR314, the "two 
animal rule") the study of a non-human primate model (the common marmoset
Callithrix jacchus jacchus) to demonstrate increased survival against lethal GD
poisoning, and protection of physiological hemi-diaphragm function after PB
pretreatment and subsequent GD exposure. Marmosets (male and female) were placed 
in the following experimental groups: (i) control (saline pretreatment only),
(ii) low dose PB (12.5 microg/kg), or (iii) high dose (39.5 microg/kg) PB. Thirty
minutes after the PB dose, animals were challenged with either saline (control)
or soman (GD, 45 microg/kg), followed 1 min later by atropine (2mg/kg) and 2-PAM 
(25mg/kg). After a further 16 min, animals were euthanized and the complete
diaphragm removed; the right hemi-diaphragm was frozen immediately at -80 degrees
C, and the left hemi-diaphragm was placed in a tissue bath for 4h (to allow for
decarbamylation to occur), then frozen. AChE activities were determined using the
automated WRAIR cholinesterase assay. Blood samples were collected for AChE
activities prior to PB, before GD challenge, and after sacrifice. RBC-AChE was
inhibited by approximately 18% and 50% at the low and high doses of PB,
respectively, compared to control (baseline) activity. In the absence of PB
pretreatment, the inhibition of RBC-AChE by GD was 98%. The recovery of
hemi-diaphragm AChE activity after the 4h wash period (decarbamylation) was
approximately 8% and 17%, at the low and high PB doses, respectively, compared
with the baseline (control) AChE activity prior to PB pretreatment or soman
exposure. The results suggest that PB pretreatment protects a critical fraction
of AChE activity in the marmoset diaphragm, which is sufficient to allow the
animal to breathe despite exposure to a dose of soman that is lethal in
unprotected animals.

corticosteroid receptor expression.

BACKGROUND: Expression of mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) and glucocorticoid
receptor (GR) genes are moderately reduced in several brain regions in
depression. These reductions could be partly due to early life stress (ELS),
which predicts emotional disorders. Controlled primate studies are important to
test whether ELS sufficient to induce long-term emotional changes also induces
long-term altered MR and/or GR brain expression.
METHODS: In the common marmoset, ELS of daily 30-120-min social isolation across 
month-1 resulted in some long-term changes in homeostasis and emotional behavior.
In some of these same subjects, the aim of this study was to use
marmoset-specific riboprobes to determine whether ELS produced long-term effects 
on brain MR and GR gene expression.
RESULTS: At adolescence, relative to control subjects, ELS marmosets exhibited
mildly reduced messenger RNA signal for both MR (-15%, p = .05) and GR (-13%, p =
.02) in hippocampus-primarily CA1-2-but not in prefrontal cortex, other cortical 
regions, or hypothalamus.
CONCLUSIONS: In adolescent marmoset monkey brains, reduced hippocampal expression
of MR and GR are consistent chronic-indicators of ELS. It is unlikely that these 
chronic, mild, specific reductions were acute-mediators of the observed long-term
emotional effects of ELS. However, they do suggest involvement of hippocampal
MR/GR in the neurodevelopmental effects of ELS.

INTRODUCTION: Moxifloxacin is the most widely used positive reference agent in
clinical cardiac repolarization studies, but it has not been characterized in
common marmosets which are uniquely suited to studies in early-stage development 
due to their small size and minimal test article requirements. The purpose of
this study was to evaluate the sensitivity of the common marmoset to detect
moxifloxacin-associated QT interval prolongation.
METHODS: Eight telemetered common marmosets were monitored for 24 h following
oral administration of moxifloxacin by gavage at 0, 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg using a
Latin square design. Concurrently, a pharmacokinetic evaluation in 8
non-telemetered animals was conducted. A rate-corrected QT (QTc) interval was
derived using an individual probabilistic QT rate-correction. QTc
(placebo-adjusted QTc change from the individual baseline) was calculated and the
relationship between pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) was
analyzed.
RESULTS: A slight, but not significant, increase in QTc was detected with 10
mg/kg of moxifloxacin. Moxifloxacin at 30 and 100 mg/kg elicited dose-dependent
increases in QTc of 14.0+/-3.6 and 35.0+/-6.2 ms, respectively, with associated
total moxifloxacin C(max) values of 6.5+/-0.5 and 16.5+/-1.6 microg/mL,
respectively. From the PK/PD relationship, the plasma concentration which would
attain QTc of 5 to 10 ms was estimated to be 1.67-3.73 microg/mL. The results
were consistent with typical clinical trial results (QTc of 6.6-14.8 ms at
2.5-3.5 microg/mL).
CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates that the common marmoset is highly
sensitive to moxifloxacin-associated changes in cardiac repolarization, assessed 
as QTc. As such, this species is suitable for precise and reliable detection of
small, but significant, drug-associated increases in QTc interval. Thus, the
common marmoset should be regarded as a validated animal model for the detection 
of QT risk in early-stage drug development and represents an important addition
to the current in vivo armamentarium.

The relationship between the production and the anti-gonadotrophic action of
prostaglandin F 2 alpha in luteal cells from the marmoset monkey (Callithrix
jacchus) in the early and mid-luteal phase.

To address the potential luteolytic role for prostaglandin F(2 alpha) (PGF(2
alpha)) in the corpus luteum of the common marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus), 
the ability of marmoset luteal cells, maintained in monolayer culture, to produce
PGF(2 alpha) was determined in vitro in the presence and absence of human
chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) and other established pharmacological modulators of
PGF(2 alpha) synthesis. We also assessed the effects of the PGF(2 alpha)
analogue, cloprostenol, on progesterone output from luteal cells isolated in the 
early luteal phase versus the mid-luteal phase (days 3 and 14 post ovulation,
respectively). Cloprostenol had no effect on progesterone output from luteal
cells isolated on day 3 of the luteal phase, whereas it significantly inhibited
both basal and hCG-stimulated progesterone synthesis by day 14 luteal cells
during the culture period 48-72 h (P<0.001). Intra-luteal PGF(2 alpha)
concentrations were 5-fold higher in luteal cells isolated in the early luteal
phase than in mid-luteal phase cells (16.5+/-3.5 versus 3.5+/-0.6 pmol/10(5)
cells). While PGF(2 alpha) production was unaffected by hCG in vitro, it was
decreased by indomethacin (1000 ng/ml) (P<0.05) and stimulated by the calcium
ionophore A23187 (10 micromol/l) (P<0.05) in luteal cells from both stages of the
luteal phase. Phospholipase A(2) did not influence PGF(2 alpha) production by day
3 luteal cells whereas at 10 IU/ml, it significantly stimulated PGF(2 alpha)
production by day 14 luteal cells (P<0.05). Hence, the timing of luteolysis in
the common marmoset monkey appears to involve changes in both the luteal cell
response to and production of PGF(2 alpha).

The somatic cell nuclear transfer technique has been applied to various mammals
to produce cloned animals; however, a standardized method is not applicable to
all species. We aimed here to develop optimum procedures for somatic cell cloning
in nonhuman primates, using common marmosets. First, we confirmed that
parthenogenetic activation of in vitro matured oocytes was successfully induced
by electrical stimulation (three cycles of 150 V/mm, 50 microsec x 2, 20 min
intervals), and this condition was applied to the egg activation procedure in the
subsequent experiments. Next, nuclear transfer to recipient enucleated oocytes
was performed 1 h before, immediately after, or 1 h after egg activation
treatment. The highest developmental rate was observed when nuclear transfer was 
performed 1 h before activation, but none of the cloned embryos developed beyond 
the eight-cell stage. To investigate the causes of the low developmental
potential of cloned embryos, a study was performed to determine whether the
presence of metaphase II (MII) chromosome in recipient ooplasm has an effect on
developmental potential. As a result, only tetraploid cloned embryos produced by 
transferring a donor cell into a recipient bearing the MII chromosome developed
into blastocysts (66.7%). In contrast, neither parthenogenetic embryos nor cloned
embryos (whether diploid or tetraploid) produced using enucleated oocytes
developed past the eight-cell stage. These results suggest that MII chromosome,
or cytoplasm proximal to the MII chromosome, plays a major role in the
development of cloned embryos in common marmosets.

The common marmoset is a small New World Primate that has been used as an
immunological model for a number of human diseases. Dendritic cells (DC) have not
been extensively characterised in this species and in particular protocols to
derive DC from living donors without the need for animal sacrifice are presently 
lacking. This study establishes new protocols to generate substantial numbers of 
marmoset DC for use in cell therapy studies. Recombinant human G-CSF was used to 
mobilise peripheral blood monocytes and CD34(+) stem cells in sufficient numbers 
for large scale in-vitro DC propagation using cytokine conditioning including
IL-4, GM-CSF, FLT3-L, stem cell factor and thrombopoietin. Marmoset DC exhibited 
morphology similar to human DC, were capable of antigen uptake and presentation
and had moderate allo-stimulatory ability. Monocyte-derived DC had a
maturation-resistant immature phenotype, whereas haematopoietic precursor-derived
DC were semi-mature in phenotype and function. This study confirms the
feasibility of the marmoset as a unique small primate model in which to pursue
DC-based immunotherapy strategies.

Motor planning for vocal production in common marmosets.

Author information: 
(1)Laboratory of Auditory Neurophysiology, Department of Biomedical Engineering, 
Johns Hopkins University, School of Medicine.

The vocal motor plan is one of the most fundamental and poorly understood
elements of primate vocal production. Here we tested whether a single vocal motor
plan comprises the full length of a vocalization. We hypothesized that if a
single motor plan was determined at vocal onset, the acoustic features early in
the call should be predictive of the subsequent call structure. Analyses were
performed on two classes of features in marmoset phee calls: continuous and
discrete. We first generated correlation matrices of all the continuous features 
of phee calls. Results showed that the start frequency of a phee's first pulse
significantly correlated with all subsequent spectral features. Moreover,
significant correlations were evident within the spectral features as well as
within the temporal features, but there was little relationship between these
measures. Using a discrete feature, 'the number of pulses in the phee call', a
discriminant function was able to correctly classify the number of pulses in the 
calls well above chance based solely on the acoustic structure of the call's
first pulse. Together, these data suggest that a vocal motor plan for the
complete call structure is established at call onset. These findings provide a
key insight into the mechanisms underlying vocal production in nonhuman primates.

The attrition rate of new drugs for central nervous system diseases including
multiple sclerosis (MS) is very high. A widely recognized bottleneck in the
selection of promising central nervous system drug candidates from the
development pipeline is the lack of sufficiently predictive animal models. Here, 
we review how the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model in the
Neotropical primate "common marmoset" can help to bridge the gap between rodent
EAE models and MS. The EAE model in the marmoset closely resembles MS in the
clinical as well as pathological presentation and can be used for fundamental
research into immunopathogenic mechanisms and for therapy development. We discuss
recent insights arising from this model, both on novel therapeutics and
immunopathogenesis.

The dopamine D(2) receptor partial agonist aplindore improves motor deficits in
MPTP-treated common marmosets alone and combined with L-dopa.

Dopamine replacement therapy in Parkinson's disease (PD) using L-dopa is
invariably associated with a loss of drug efficacy ("wearing off") and the onset 
of dyskinesia. The use of dopamine receptor partial agonists might improve
therapeutic benefit without increased dyskinesia expression but may antagonise
the effects of L-dopa. We now examine the effects of the novel high affinity,
dopamine D(2) receptor partial agonist, aplindore alone and in combination with
L-dopa in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated common 
marmoset. In non-dyskinetic MPTP treated animals, aplindore (0.05-1.0 mg/kg p.o.)
produced a dose-dependent reversal of motor disability and an increase in
locomotor activity that was maximal at doses of 0.2 mg/kg and above. In animals
previously exposed to L: -dopa to induce dyskinesia, escalating and repeated
dosing of aplindore (0.05-0.5 mg/kg p.o.) produced a sustained, dose-related
improvement in motor disability and an increase in locomotor activity. The
effects were maximal at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg and above and not different from
those produced by L-dopa (12.5 mg/kg plus carbidopa 12.5 mg/kg p.o.). Aplindore
administration also led to dose-dependent expression of dyskinesia but at 0.1
mg/kg, this was significantly less intense than that produced by L-dopa.
Administration of aplindore (1.0 mg/kg p.o.) in combination with L-dopa (2.5
mg/kg plus carbidopa 12.5 mg/kg p.o.) did not inhibit the reversal of motor
deficits but improved motor disability and increased both locomotor activity and 
dyskinesia expression equivalent to that produced by L-dopa (12.5 mg/kg plus
carbidopa 12.5 mg/kg p.o.). These data suggest that dopamine receptor partial
agonists would be effective in the treatment of Parkinson's disease and would not
inhibit the beneficial actions of L-dopa.

To facilitate common marmoset brain research, we produced a DNA microarray with
7557 probe sets derived from the common marmoset brain. Gene expression profiles 
in the frontal lobe, hippocampus, cerebellum and amygdaloid nucleus were then
analyzed and the top 100 probe sets expressed in each structure were compared.
The three lists for the frontal lobe, hippocampus and amygdaloid nucleus were
very similar but the probe sets for the cerebellum demonstrated specific
differences. Some of the genes specifically expressed in cerebellum were analyzed
by real-time quantitative PCR to verify the DNA microarray results. Of examined
genes, 5 showed extremely strong expression in cerebellum in comparison with the 
other structures. The results of real-time quantitative PCR were well consistent 
with the microarray findings, validating our newly developed DNA microarray as a 
useful tool for brain research with the common marmoset.

Using multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), behavioral, and
immunohistochemical analyses, we examined pathological changes at the acute,
sub-acute, and chronic stages, induced by permanent or temporary ischemia in the 
common marmoset. Animals underwent either permanent (pMCAO) or 3-h transient
(tMCAO) occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCAO) by the intraluminal thread
approach. MRI scans were performed at 1 h, 8, and 45 days after MCAO.
Sensorimotor deficits were assessed weekly up to 45 days after MCAO.
Immunohistological studies were performed to examine neuronal loss, astrogliosis,
and neurogenesis. Remote lesions were analyzed using retrograde neuronal tracers.
At day 8 (D8), the lesion defined on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)-MRI and
T2-MRI was significantly larger in pMCAO as compared with that in the tMCAO
group. At D45, the former still displayed abnormal signals in T2-MRI. Post-mortem
analyses revealed widespread neuronal loss and associated astrogliosis to a
greater extent in the pMCAO group. Neurogenesis was increased in both groups in
the vicinity of the lesion. Disconnections between the caudate and the temporal
cortex, and between the parietal cortex and the thalamus, were observed.
Sensorimotor impairments were more severe and long-lasting in pMCAO relative to
tMCAO. The profile of brain damage and functional deficits seen in the marmoset
suggests that this model could be suitable to test therapies against stroke.

and MPTP-treated common marmosets.

Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibition is widely used to potentiate the
effects of levodopa in Parkinson's disease but the effects of nigral dopaminergic
cell loss and levodopa treatment on COMT activity are not known. The present
study investigated the expression of COMT in the brain and liver of normal common
marmosets, and animals treated with MPTP and those treated with levodopa to
induce dyskinesia. Reverse transcript PCR demonstrated the expression of COMT
mRNA in the liver, cortex and striatum of normal marmosets. Using Western
blotting, the presence of two subunits of COMT protein, membrane bound COMT
(MB-COMT) and soluble COMT (S-COMT), was shown in the liver, cortex and striatum 
of normal marmosets. Quantitative analysis of the MB-COMT and S-COMT subunit
bands showed that there was no significant difference in the density of bands in 
MPTP treated marmosets or those exposed to levodopa compared to normal animals.
COMT immunoreactivity was expressed in many brain regions including the cortex
and striatum. No difference in COMT staining intensity was observed between
normal, MPTP exposed or MPTP plus levodopa treated animals. COMT immunostaining
was present in most striatal neurones and it was occasionally seen in glial
cells. The data from present study demonstrated the expression of COMT mRNA and
protein in the brain of common marmoset contrary to a previous report that it is 
not expressed in this species. COMT activity appears unaffected by loss of the
dopaminergic nigro-striatal pathway and levodopa treatment.

The common marmoset, Callithrix jacchus, is of growing importance for research in
neuroscience and related fields. In the present work, we describe a combined
histological and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) atlas constructed from the
brains of two adult female marmosets. Histological sections were processed from
Nissl staining and digitized to produce an atlas in a large format that
facilitates visualization of structures with significant detail. Naming of
identifiable brain structures was performed utilizing current terminology. The
histological sections and a simplified schematic atlas are available online at

Placental insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) and its relation to litter size 
in the common marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus).

The primate placenta produces a wide variety of hormones throughout gestation
that regulate placental function and fetal growth. One such hormone is
insulin-like growth factor-II (IGF-II), a peptide implicated in cell division,
differentiation, and amino acid transport. IGF-II concentrations were measured in
23 common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) term placentas from twin and triplet
litters in order to determine whether previously described differences in
fetoplacental phenotype such as placental and litter mass and placental surface
area were related to differences in endocrine function. IGF-II was extracted from
frozen tissue samples and measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit
designed for human tissue, which was validated for marmoset placenta. IGF-II
concentrations were not related to placental or litter mass, and twin and triplet
placentas did not differ in total concentration. However, per individual fetus,
triplets were associated with a significant 42% reduction in IGF-II concentration
(P = 0.03), and IGF-II concentration per gram of fetal mass was a third lower in 
triplet litters. The triplet placenta exhibits a global expansion of the surface 
area which was contrasted by a per unit area reduction in IGF-II concentration (r
= -0.75, P = 0.01), a pattern that explains why twin and triplet placentas
overall did not differ in concentration. Per fetus, triplet pregnancies are
associated with relatively less maternal mass, placental mass and microscopic
surface area suggesting that the intrauterine growth of triplets is supported by 
systems that increase the efficiency of nutrient transfer. The finding that
individual triplet fetuses are also associated with significantly lower IGF-II
concentrations is consistent with the view that the marmoset fetoplacental unit
exhibits a flexible pattern of placental allocation and metabolism. Plasticity in
placental endocrine and metabolic function is likely to play an important role in
the ability of the fetus to sense and accommodate the intrauterine environment
and, by extension, the external ecology.

We previously reported that implantation of dendritic cells (DCs) into the
injured site activates neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) and promotes
functional recovery after spinal cord injury (SCI) in mice. Working toward
clinical application of DC therapy for SCI, we analyzed whether DCs promote
functional recovery after SCI in a non-human primate, the common marmoset (CM).
CMs are usually born as dizygotic twins. They are thus natural bone marrow and
peripheral blood chimeras due to sharing of the placental circulation between
dizygotic twins, leading to functional immune tolerance. In this study, to
identify adequate CM donor-and-host pairs, mixed leukocyte reaction (MLR) assays 
were performed. Then, CM-DCs were generated from the bone marrow of the twin
selected to be donor and transplanted into the injured site of the spinal cord of
the other twin selected to be host, 7 days after injury. Histological analyses
revealed fewer areas of demyelination around the injured site in DC-treated CMs
than in controls. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that more motor neurons and
corticospinal tracts were preserved after SCI in DC-treated CMs. Motor functions 
were evaluated using three different behavior tests and earlier functional
recovery was observed in DC-treated CMs. These results suggest DC therapy to
possibly be beneficial in primates with SCI and that this treatment has potential
for clinical application.

Myeloarchitecture, the pattern of myelin density across the cerebral cortex, has 
long been visualized in histological sections to identify distinct anatomical
areas of the cortex. In humans, two-dimensional (2D) magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) has been used to visualize myeloarchitecture in select areas of the cortex,
such as the stripe of Gennari in the primary visual cortex and Heschl's gyrus in 
the primary auditory cortex. Here, we investigated the use of MRI contrast based 
on longitudinal relaxation time (T(1)) to visualize myeloarchitecture in vivo
over the entire cortex of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a small
non-human primate that is becoming increasingly important in neuroscience and
neurobiology research. Using quantitative T(1) mapping, we found that T(1) at 7T 
in a cortical region with a high myelin content was 15% shorter than T(1) in a
region with a low myelin content. To maximize this T(1) contrast for imaging
cortical myelination patterns, we optimized a magnetization-prepared rapidly
acquired gradient echo (MP-RAGE) sequence. In whole-brain, 3D T(1)-weighted
images made in vivo with the sequence, we identified six major cortical areas
with high myelination and confirmed the results with histological sections
stained for myelin. We also identified several subtle features of
myeloarchitecture, showing the sensitivity of our technique. The ability to image
myeloarchitecture over the entire cortex may prove useful in studies of
longitudinal changes of the topography of the cortex associated with development 
and neuronal plasticity, as well as for guiding and confirming the location of
functional measurements.

Rapidly evolving marmoset MSMB genes are differently expressed in the male
genital tract.

Chemistry, University Hospital MAS, Malmö, Sweden. ake.lundwall@med.lu.se

BACKGROUND: Beta-microseminoprotein, an abundant component in prostatic fluid, is
encoded by the potential tumor suppressor gene MSMB. Some New World monkeys carry
several copies of this gene, in contrast to most mammals, including humans, which
have one only. Here we have investigated the background for the species
difference by analyzing the chromosomal organization and expression of MSMB in
the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).
METHODS: Genes were identified in the Callithrix jacchus genome database using
bioinformatics and transcripts were analyzed by RT-PCR and quantified by real
time PCR in the presence of SYBR green.
RESULTS: The common marmoset has five MSMB: one processed pseudogene and four
functional genes. The latter encompass homologous genomic regions of 32-35 kb,
containing the genes of 12-14 kb and conserved upstream and downstream regions of
14-19 kb and 3-4 kb. One gene, MSMB1, occupies the same position on the
chromosome as the single human gene. On the same chromosome, but several Mb away,
is another MSMB locus situated with MSMB2, MSMB3 and MSMB4 arranged in tandem.
Measurements of transcripts demonstrated that all functional genes are expressed 
in the male genital tract, generating very high transcript levels in the
prostate. The transcript levels in seminal vesicles and testis are two and four
orders of magnitude lower. A single gene, MSMB3, accounts for more than 90% of
MSMB transcripts in both the prostate and the seminal vesicles, whereas in the
testis around half of the transcripts originate from MSMB2. These genes display
rapid evolution with a skewed distribution of mutated nucleotides; in MSMB2 they 
affect nucleotides encoding the N-terminal Greek key domain, whereas in MSMB3 it 
is the C-terminal MSMB-unique domain that is affected.
CONCLUSION: Callitrichide monkeys have four functional MSMB that are all
expressed in the male genital tract, but the product from one gene, MSMB3, will
predominate in seminal plasma. This gene and MSMB2, the predominating testicular 
gene, have accumulated mutations that affect different parts of the translation
products, suggesting an ongoing molecular specialization that presumably yields
functional differences in accessory sex glands and testis.

Non-human primates (NHPs) offer valuable animal models for basic research into
human diseases and for the preclinical validation of new therapeutics. Detailed
in situ examination of the involved cell types using immunohistochemistry is
often hampered by the lack of cross-reactive antibodies (Abs). In the current
study, we have tested a large panel of monoclonal antibodies raised against human
leukocyte differentiation and activation markers for cross-reactivity on
cryosections of lymphoid tissue from six NHP species. In total, we have tested
130 Abs against 69 antigens expressed in tissues from one great ape species
(chimpanzee/Pan troglodytes), two Old World species (rhesus macaque/Macaca
mulatta and cynomolgus macaque/Macaca fascicularis), and three New World species 
(common marmoset/Callithrix jacchus, cotton-top tamarin/Saguinus oedipus, and owl
monkey/Aotus triviogatus). We have found a large panel of cross-reactive Abs: 93 
of 102 (91%) in chimpanzee, 97 of 125 (78%) in rhesus macaque, 70 of 109 (64%) in
cynomolgus macaque, 69 of 116 (60%) in common marmoset, 40 of 81 (49%) in
cotton-top tamarin, and 35 of 80 (44%) in owl monkey. The availability of a
reliable panel of cross-reactive markers is important to gaining further insight 
into immunological processes in disease-affected tissues from NHP species.

Wild common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) feed on fruits, insects, and gums, all
of which provide different digestive challenges. Much of the ingested mass of
fruits consists of seeds. In general, seeds represent indigestible bulk to
marmosets and could inhibit feeding if they are not eliminated rapidly. In
contrast, gums are beta-linked polysaccharides that require microbial
fermentation. Their digestion would benefit from an extended residence time
within the gut. Earlier research found that mean retention time (MRT) for a
liquid digestive marker (cobalt EDTA) was significantly longer than MRT for a
particulate marker (chromium-mordanted fiber), suggesting that common marmosets
preferentially retain liquid digesta. We conducted two four-day-long digestion
trials on 13 individually housed adult common marmosets fed a single-item,
purified diet in order to examine the relations among MRT of cobalt EDTA and
chromium-mordanted fiber, food dry matter intake (DMI), and apparent
digestibility of dry matter (ADDM). We compared the MRT values with the data from
the previous study mentioned above and a study using polystyrene beads. There
were no significant correlations among MRT, ADDM, or DMI, although increases in
DMI between trials were associated with decreases in MRT. ADDM was consistent
within individuals between trials; but the mean values ranged from 75.0 to 83.4% 
among individuals. We found no difference in MRT between the liquid (17.5 + or - 
1.6 hr) and particulate (17.9 + or - 1.4 hr) markers. Although these values were 
not significantly different than found previously, the MRT for chromium-mordanted
fiber tended to be longer. This probably reflects the relatively small size of
the chromium-mordanted fiber particles used in this study. An inverse
relationship between particle size and MRT was evident; the mean MRT of
polysterene beads, the largest marker, was only 8.3 + or - 1.5 hr. Marmosets
appear to retain liquids and small particles within the gut longer than large
particles.

Prenatal programming of metabolic syndrome in the common marmoset is associated
with increased expression of 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1.

Edinburgh, U.K.

OBJECTIVE: Recent studies in humans and animal models of obesity have shown
increased adipose tissue activity of 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1
(11beta-HSD1), which amplifies local tissue glucocorticoid concentrations. The
reasons for this 11beta-HSD1 dysregulation are unknown. Here, we tested whether
11beta-HSD1 expression, like the metabolic syndrome, is "programmed" by prenatal 
environmental events in a nonhuman primate model, the common marmoset monkey.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We used a "fetal programming" paradigm where brief
antenatal exposure to glucocorticoids leads to the metabolic syndrome in the
offspring. Pregnant marmosets were given the synthetic glucocorticoid
dexamethasone orally for 1 week in either early or late gestation, or they were
given vehicle. Tissue 11beta-HSD1 and glucocorticoid receptor mRNA expression
were examined in the offspring at 4 and 24 months of age.
RESULTS: Prenatal dexamethasone administration, selectively during late
gestation, resulted in early and persistent elevations in 11beta-HSD1 mRNA
expression and activity in the liver, pancreas, and subcutaneous-but not
visceral-fat. The increase in 11beta-HSD1 occurred before animals developed
obesity or overt features of the metabolic syndrome. In contrast to rodents, in
utero dexamethasone exposure did not alter glucocorticoid receptor expression in 
metabolic tissues in marmosets.
CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that long-term upregulation of 11beta-HSD1 in
metabolically active tissues may follow prenatal "stress" hormone exposure and
indicates a novel mechanism for fetal origins of adult obesity and the metabolic 
syndrome.

OBJECTIVE: Common marmosets are considered experimental animals of primates
useful for medical research. We developed several monoclonal antibodies (mAbs)
directed to CD molecules to gain initial insight into the immune and
hematopoietic systems of this organism, and analyzed the basic cellularity and
characters of marmoset lymphocytes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Anti-marmoset CD antigen mAbs were prepared using marmoset
antigen-expressing transfectants and used for flow cytometric analyses and cell
fractionation. Expression of T-cell-related cytokine gene transcripts was
examined in response to T-cell receptor stimulation by reverse transcription
polymerase chain reaction analyses. Hematopoietic progenitor activities of
marmoset bone marrow cells were examined in fractionated cells by mAbs against
CD117 (c-kit) and CD34.
RESULTS: CD4 and CD8 expression profiles in T-cell subsets of marmoset were
essentially similar to those in mouse and human. CD4(+) and CD8(+) subsets were
isolated from marmoset spleens. Detected transcripts after stimulation of T cells
included Th1-, Th2-, and Th17-related cytokines in CD4(+) cells and cytotoxic
proteases in CD8(+) cells, respectively. Colony-forming abilities were detected
mainly in CD117 (c-kit)(+) cells, irrespective of CD34 expression.
CONCLUSIONS: Marmoset immune system was basically similar to human and mouse
systems.

images obtained during construction of this website, we developed stand-alone
software for navigation of electrodes or injection needles for stereotaxic
electrophysiological or anatomical experiments in vivo. This software enables us 
to draw lines on exchangeable section images, measure the length and angle of
lines, superimpose a stereotaxic reference grid on the image, and send the image 
to the system clipboard. The software, Stereo Navi 2.0, is freely available at

Connections of the marmoset rostrotemporal auditory area: express pathways for
analysis of affective content in hearing.

The current hierarchical model of primate auditory cortical processing proposes a
core of 'primary-like' areas, which is surrounded by secondary (belt) and
tertiary (parabelt) regions. The rostrotemporal auditory cortical area (RT)
remains the least well characterized of the three proposed core areas, and its
functional organization has only recently come under scrutiny. Here we used
injections of anterograde and retrograde tracers in the common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus) to examine the connectivity of RT and its adjacent areas. As
expected from the current model, RT exhibited dense core-like reciprocal
connectivity with the ventral division of the medial geniculate body, the rostral
core area and the auditory belt, but had weaker connections with the parabelt.
However, RT also projected to the ipsilateral rostromedial prefrontal cortex
(area 10), the dorsal temporal pole and the ventral caudate nucleus, as well as
bilaterally to the lateral nucleus of the amygdala. Thus, RT has connectivity
with limbic structures previously believed to connect only with higher-order
auditory association cortices, and is probably functionally distinct from the
other core areas. While this view is consistent with a proposed role of RT in
temporal integration, our results also indicate that RT could provide an

This study was performed to develop microsatellite DNA markers, which are useful 
for linkage analyses, gene mapping and blood chimera analyses in the common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). We searched 153 of 295 bacterial artificial clone 
DNA sequences of the common marmoset that were archived in the NCBI database in
2004. On the basis of the search, we designed 186 PCR primer sets. When tested
using 5 unrelated individuals, we successfully detected 154 markers with PCR
products, of which 80 (52%) were polymorphic and 74 (48%) were monomorphic. We
assigned each of the 154 markers to a human chromosome based on BLAST searches,
which was achieved by searching the entire human genome sequences using an
approximately 3 kb section of each forward primer sequence, including
approximately 1.5 kb of the upstream and approximately 1.5 kb of the downstream
sequences. Combining our assignment data and the chromosome painting-assisted
karyotype of the common marmoset [Sherlock et al., Genomics 33:214-219, 1996], we
prepared a list of 154 microsatellite DNA markers that were assigned to human
chromosomes, except for the Y chromosome, which is equivalent to a chromosome
map. Using five microsatellite DNA markers, we have established a fragment
analysis method with a sequencer, which can be routinely used for blood chimera
analysis, parentage diagnosis and individual identification.

Distribution of vasopressin and oxytocin binding sites in the brain and upper
spinal cord of the common marmoset.

The aim of this study was to label selectively and to map central vasopressin
(AVP) and oxytocin (OT) binding sites in the common marmoset. [(125)I]VPA, a
compound selective in rodents and human for the AVP V(1a) receptor, yielded the
same labeling pattern as [(3)H]AVP, thus suggesting that most AVP receptors
present in the marmoset brain are of the V(1a) subtype. Numerous areas exhibited 
AVP binding sites, among which the olfactory bulb, the accumbens nucleus, the bed
nucleus of the stria terminalis, the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic, arcuate and
ventromedial nuclei, the medial amygdaloid nucleus, the nucleus of the solitary
tract and the cerebral cortex. Binding sites for [(125)I]OTA, a selective OT
receptor antagonist in rat and human, were markedly less abundant than
[(125)I]VPA ones, and, to a few exceptions, expressed in different areas. Neither
AVP, nor OT binding sites were detected in the hypothalamic paraventricular (PVN)
and supraoptic (SON) nuclei identified by neurophysin immunoreactivity. Marked
species-related differences were observed in the distribution of both AVP and OT 
binding sites. Altogether, our data provide a morphological basis to investigate 
the function of central AVP and OT in the marmoset.

Spontaneous pathology of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) and tamarins
(Saguinus oedipus, Saguinus mystax).

(1)College of Veterinary Medicine, Western University of Health Science, Pomona, 
CA, USA.

BACKGROUND: Marmosets and tamarins are increasingly used in research, but their
pathology remains poorly defined compared with Old World primates.
METHODS: Necropsy records of 129 marmosets and 52 tamarins were reviewed; none
was used experimentally.
RESULTS: The most common marmoset lesions were dehydration, emaciation,
nephritis, colitis, and inanition. The most common tamarin lesions were
dehydration, ascites, emaciation, and congestive heart failure. Colitis and heart
disease were the most common cause of death in marmosets and tamarins,
respectively. Immature marmoset and tamarin deaths often occurred within the
first month of life. Immature marmosets usually died from inanition, stillbirth, 
and colitis; immature tamarins from atelectasis, stillbirth, heart failure, and
colitis. Lymphoma was the most common neoplasm for both marmosets and tamarins.
CONCLUSION: The findings were similar to prior reports with differences in
frequency and severity. We report the first case of endometriosis in a marmoset.

CD73, a novel cell surface antigen that characterizes retinal photoreceptor
precursor cells.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Molecular and Developmental Biology, Institute of Medical
Science, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.

PURPOSE: The authors sought to identify cell surface markers of photoreceptor and
its precursor cells.
METHODS: The expression of surface CD antigens that label both temporally and
spatially distinct populations of mouse retinal cells were examined. Of the
antibodies that showed positive signals in retinal cells, CD73 was focused on for
more detailed analyses.
RESULTS: Mouse retinal subpopulations that expressed CD73 first appeared around
birth and subsequently increased dramatically in number, eventually representing 
more than 90% of the retinal cells in the adult. CD73(+) cells were postmitotic
and mostly rhodopsin-negative at postnatal day 1. However, in the adult retina,
most of these cells expressed rhodopsin but not s-opsin. In reaggregation
cultures, CD73(+) cells differentiated into rhodopsin-positive cells more rapidly
than CD73(-) cells, which supports the idea that CD73 is an early photoreceptor
lineage marker. The effects of ectopic expression in retinal cells of Nrl and
Crx, both of which are transcription factors known to be expressed in
photoreceptor lineage, suggest that CD73 is genetically downstream of Crx in the 
rod cell differentiation lineage. Adult retina of the common marmoset monkey also
showed correlation of the expression pattern of rhodopsin and CD73.
CONCLUSIONS: CD73 is a cell surface marker of cone/rod common precursors and
mature rod cells in mice and is genetically localized between Nrl and Crx. The
expression of CD73 was conserved in primate rod cells, and CD73 provides an
useful tool to purify photoreceptor cells for transplantation aimed at the
regeneration of photoreceptors.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is increasingly attractive for use as a 
non-human primate animal model in biomedical research. It has a relatively high
reproduction rate for a primate, making it potentially suitable for transgenic
modification. Although several attempts have been made to produce non-human
transgenic primates, transgene expression in the somatic tissues of live infants 
has not been demonstrated by objective analyses such as polymerase chain reaction
with reverse transcription or western blots. Here we show that the injection of a
self-inactivating lentiviral vector in sucrose solution into marmoset embryos
results in transgenic common marmosets that expressed the transgene in several
organs. Notably, we achieved germline transmission of the transgene, and the
transgenic offspring developed normally. The successful creation of transgenic
marmosets provides a new animal model for human disease that has the great
advantage of a close genetic relationship with humans. This model will be
valuable to many fields of biomedical research.

Lack of adaptation of chimeric GB virus B/hepatitis C virus in the marmoset
model: possible effects of bottleneck.

Research, San Antonio, TX 78227, USA.

Approximately 3% of the world population is chronically infected with hepatitis C
virus (HCV). GB virus B (GBV-B), a surrogate model for HCV, causes hepatitis in
tamarins and is the virus phylogenetically most closely related to HCV.
Previously we described a chimeric GBV-B containing an HCV insert from the 5'
noncoding region (NCR) that was adapted for efficient replication in tamarins
(Saguinus species). We have also demonstrated that wild-type (WT) GBV-B rapidly
adapts for efficient replication in a closely related species, the common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). Here, we demonstrate that the chimeric virus
failed to adapt during serial passage in marmosets. The chimeric virus was
passaged four times through 24 marmosets. During passage, two marmoset phenotypes
were observed: susceptible and partially resistant. Although appearing to adapt
in a resistant animal during a prolonged and gradual increase in viremia, the
chimeric GBV-B failed to replicate efficiently upon passage to a naïve marmoset. 
The resistance was specific to the chimeric virus, as the chimeric
virus-resistant animals were susceptible to marmoset-adapted WT virus during
rechallenge studies. Three isolates of the chimeric virus were sequenced, and 20 
nucleotide changes were observed, including eight amino acid changes. Three
unique changes were observed in the 5' NCR chimeric insert, an area that is
highly conserved in HCV. We speculate that the failure of the chimeric virus to
adapt in marmosets might be due to a bottleneck that occurs at the time of
infection of resistant animals, which may lead to a loss of fitness upon serial
passage.

histological sections of the marmoset brain using various staining techniques.
For virtual microscopy, high-resolution digital images of sections were obtained 
with Aperio Scanscope. The digital images were then converted to Zoomify files
(zoomable multiresolution image files). Thereby, we could provide the
multiresolution images of the marmoset brains for fast interactive viewing on the
web via the Internet. In addition, we describe an automated method to obtain

Giardia intestinalis is a common protozoan parasite that can infect many
laboratory animal primates, although its role as a contributor to the induction
of gastrointestinal disease remains unclear. This study sought to investigate the
prevalence of Giardia in a colony of common marmosets by using a Giardia
antigen-capture assay and to address the possible eradication of this infection
by using tinidazole, an antiprotozoal similar to metronidazole but requiring
fewer doses. Among 31 colony marmosets, 13 (42%) were positive for Giardia. Two
doses of oral tinidazole eliminated the infection in all animals. Repeat testing 
of the 13 Giardia-positive monkeys 1 y later showed that 11 remained negative and
that treated animals had a significant increase in weight at 1 y. Giardia antigen
is common in common marmoset feces, and treatment using oral tinidazole is
possible and highly effective.

Fetal signaling through placental structure and endocrine function: illustrations
and implications from a nonhuman primate model.

Rutherford JN(1).

USA. julienne-rutherford@northwestern.edu

The placenta is a transmitter of fetal need and fetal quality, interfacing
directly with maternal physiology and ecology. Plasticity of placental structure 
and function across the developmental timeframe of gestation may serve as an
important tool by which a fetus calibrates its growth to shifting maternal
ecology and resource availability, and thereby signals its quality and
adaptability to a changing environment. Signals of this quality may be conveyed
by the size of the placental interface, an important marker of fetal access to
maternal resources, or by production of placental insulin-like growth factor-II, 
a driver of fetoplacental growth. Litter size variation in the common marmoset
monkey offers the opportunity to explore intrauterine resource allocation and
placental plasticity in an important nonhuman primate model. Triplet marmosets
are born at lower birth weights and have poorer postnatal outcomes and
survivorship than do twins; triplet placentas differ in placental efficiency,
microscopic morphology, and endocrine function. Through placental plasticity,
triplet fetuses are able to adjust functional access to maternal resources in a
way that allows pregnancy to proceed. However, the costs of such mechanisms may
relate to reduced fetal growth and altered postnatal outcomes, with the potential
to lead to adverse adult health consequences, suggesting an important link
between the placenta itself and the developmental origins of health and disease.

The validity of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) as a model for human
disease depends on the development of parameters with clinical relevance. We
tested the effect of treatment with MPTP in two newly developed non-invasive
motor behavioral paradigms in the context of Parkinson's disease. The "Tower" was
designed to quantify the marmoset's natural jumping behavior as a measure for
akinesia, the "Hourglass" to test the marmoset's natural righting reflex as
measure for rigidity, analogous to axial motor behavior in humans. MPTP treatment
affected marmoset behavior in both testing paradigms. The marmoset's righting
reflex in the Hourglass remained significantly impaired during the full 3-week
period after the MPTP intoxication. In the Tower, the marmosets were not able to 
jump the largest distances one week after MPTP and showed a persistent reduction 
in activity during the 3-week period after the MPTP intoxication. Because not all
aspects of motor behavior are similarly affected by MPTP, a complete behavioral
sketch of parkinsonian marmosets should preferably include a range of motor
behavior functions to create an overview of the full range of motor impairments. 
Both the Hourglass and Tower test provide important behavioral parameters in a
clinically relevant multiple testing approach in motor disorder models.

BACKGROUND: Animal models of human brain disorders often have to rely on
non-human primates because of their immunological, physiological, and cognitive
similarities to humans.
METHODS: Localized proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy was performed to assess
cerebral metabolite profiles of male common marmoset monkeys in vivo and to
determine putative alterations of adult brain metabolism in response to
intrauterine hyperexposure to the synthetic glucocorticoid hormone dexamethasone.
RESULTS: Excellent spectral quality allowed for absolute quantification of the
concentrations of major metabolites in predominantly white matter, gray matter,
and thalamus. Marmoset monkeys intrauterinely hyperexposed to dexamethasone
revealed normal neurochemical profiles at adulthood.
CONCLUSIONS: Prenatally applied dexamethasone does not lead to persistent
metabolic alterations affecting adult brain integrity.

Variations in male parenting behavior and physiology in the common marmoset.

Wisconsin 53715, USA. ziegler@primate.wisc.edu

Infant survival and wellbeing is dependent upon good parenting skills. In some
species of primates, fathers are necessary to ensure both positive developmental 
and social outcomes for their offspring. Common marmosets and the related
cotton-top tamarin monkeys provide extensive paternal care of multiple offspring 
and are essential for infant survival. However, we have found significant
variation in a father's motivation to respond to infant stimuli. Additionally,
marmoset males who are experienced fathers are significantly more motivated to
respond to infants and infant stimuli than adult males who have yet to be
fathers. Expectant fathers appear to be preparing for their energetic role in
infant care by responding with increases in multiple reproductive hormones and
showing weight gain during their mate's pregnancy. Male marmosets have been shown
to be hormonally responsive to scent signals. Males show increased testosterone
shortly after smelling periovulatory scents and lower levels of testosterone
following presentation of their own infant's scent. These two inverse
testosterone responses combined indicate that paternal males have a flexible
system of responding to socially relevant odor cues. Thus males can be ready to
mate when their mate is fertile while continuing to be responsive to their
infants when these two events occur simultaneously. A male's hormonal and
physical responsiveness to parenting may be due to pair bonding between the male 
and his mate. Examining the variability between males in their behavioral,
physical, and hormonal responses to their mate's pregnancy, and infant stimuli
provides the means for determining the mechanisms of good parenting in fathers.

Effects of elevated circulating cortisol concentrations on maternal behavior in
common marmoset monkeys (Callithrix jacchus).

Both acute and chronic stress can impair maternal behavior and increase rates of 
infant abuse in several species. The mechanisms inducing these effects are
unknown, but experimental manipulation of circulating corticosterone levels
alters maternal behavior in rats, and circulating or excreted cortisol
concentrations have been found to correlate either positively or negatively with 
maternal behavior in humans and nonhuman primates. In this study, therefore, we
experimentally tested the hypothesis that both acute and chronic treatment with
exogenous glucocorticoids would alter maternal behavior in a primate, the common 
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). Multiparous females, approximately 3-5 weeks
postpartum, received daily injections of either cortisol (hydrocortisone sodium
succinate and hydrocortisone acetate; N=7) or vehicle (N=7) for 8 days, and
maternal behavior was characterized under baseline conditions as well as during
exposure to a noise stressor. Cortisol treatment successfully elevated both
morning and afternoon plasma cortisol concentrations and suppressed circulating
levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone. In home-cage observations,
cortisol-treated females carried their infants significantly less than control
mothers, and in noise-stressor tests, several hours after the first cortisol or
vehicle treatment, cortisol-treated mothers inspected their infants significantly
more often than controls. Aggression towards infants was infrequent and mild, and
did not differ between treatment groups. These findings provide the first
experimental evidence that cortisol elevations can alter maternal behavior in
primates. As these effects were limited in scope, however, they suggest that
other stress-responsive hormones or neuropeptides may additionally play a role in
mediating the effects of stress on maternal behavior.

The efficacy of many new immunomodulatory therapies for multiple sclerosis (MS)
patients has often been disappointing, reflecting our incomplete understanding of
this enigmatic disease. There is a growing awareness that, at least in part,
there may be limited applicability to the human disease of results obtained in
the widely studied MS model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in rodents.
This review describes the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model
developed in a small neotropical primate, the common marmoset (Callithrix
jacchus). The model has features including clinicopathologic correlation
patterns, lesion heterogeneity, immunologic mechanisms, and disease markers that 
more closely mimic the human disease. Several unique features of experimental
autoimmune encephalomyelitis in marmosets, together with their outbred nature and
close genetic and immunologic similarities to humans, create an attractive
experimental model for translational research into MS, particularly for the
preclinical evaluation of new biologic therapeutic molecules that cannot be
investigated in rodents because of their species specificity. Moreover, this
model provides new insights into possible pathogenetic mechanisms in MS.

Susceptibility and lethality studies of inhalational tularaemia were undertaken
using the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) to determine its suitability as a 
non-human primate model. Pairs of marmosets were exposed to varying challenge
doses of Francisella tularensis by the airborne route and monitored for up to 14 
days postchallenge (p.c.). Lethal infection was achieved following a retained
dose of less than 10 bacterial colony-forming units (CFU). However, precise
LD(50) determination was not possible. The model was characterized using a target
challenge dose of approximately 100 CFU. Increased core body temperature was the 
first indicator of disease, at approximately 2.5 days p.c. Overt clinical signs
were first observed 12-18 h after the temperature increase. Significantly
decreased activity was observed after approximately 3 days. All animals succumbed
to infection between 4.5 and 7 days p.c. At postmortem examination, gross
pathology was evident in the liver, spleen and lungs of all animals and high
bacterial numbers were detected in all the organs assessed. Bacteraemia was
demonstrated in all animals postmortem. Histopathological observations included
severe suppurative bronchopneumonia, severe multifocal pyogranulomatous
hepatitis, splenitis and lymphadenitis. Tularaemia disease progression in the
common marmoset therefore appears to be consistent with the disease seen in
humans and other animal models. The common marmoset may therefore be considered a
suitable model for further studies of inhalational tularaemia.

This report explores aspects of developing obesity in two captive populations of 
common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus), a small primate with a short lifespan that
may be of value in modeling chronic aspects of obesity acquisition and its
lifetime effects. Two populations were examined. In study 1, body composition,
lipid parameters, and glucose metabolic parameters were measured in a population 
of 64 adult animals. Animals classified as obese (>80th percentile relative fat
based on sex) displayed both dyslipidemia (higher triglyceride and very
low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)) and altered glucose metabolism (higher fasting
glucose and HbA(1c)). Using operational definitions of atypical values for
factors associated with metabolic syndrome in humans, five subjects (7.8%) had at
least three atypical factors and five others had two atypical factors. A
previously unreported finding in these normally sexually monomorphic primates was
higher body weight, fat weights, and percent fat in females compared to males. In
a second study, longitudinal weight data for a larger population (n = 210) were
analyzed to evaluate the development of high weight animals. Differences in
weights for animals that would exceed the 90th percentile in early adulthood were
evident from infancy, with a 15% difference in weight between future-large weight
vs. their future-normal weight litter mates as early as 4-6 months of age. The
marmoset, therefore, demonstrates similar suites of obesity-related alterations
to those seen in other primates, including humans, suggesting that this species
is worthy of consideration for obesity studies in which its fast maturity, high
fertility, relatively short lifespan, and small size may be of advantage.

MRI at 7 Tesla has been used to investigate the accumulation of manganese in the 
occipital cortex of common marmoset monkeys (Callithrix jacchus) after
administering four fractionated injections of 30 mg/kg MnCl(2) . 4H(2)O in the
tail vein. We found a statistically significant decrease in T(1) in the primary
(V1) and secondary (V2) areas of the visual cortex caused by an accumulation of
manganese. The larger T(1) shortening in V1 (DeltaT(1) = 640 ms) relative to V2
(DeltaT(1) = 490 ms) allowed us to robustly detect the V1/V2 border in vivo using
heavily T(1)-weighted MRI. Furthermore, the dorso-medial (DM) and middle-temporal
(MT) areas of the visual pathway could be identified by their T(1)-weighted
enhancement. We showed by comparison to histological sections stained for
cytochrome oxidase (CO) activity that the extent of V1 is accurately identified
throughout the visual cortex by manganese-enhanced MRI (MEMRI). This provides a
means of visualizing functional cortical regions in vivo and could be used in
longitudinal studies of phenomena such as cortical plasticity, and for
non-destructive localization of cortical regions to guide in the implementation
of functional techniques.

Male fertility and strategies for fertility preservation following childhood
cancer treatment.

Mitchell RT, Saunders PTK, Sharpe RM, Kelnar CJH, Wallace WHB.

Infertility in the male is a potential complication of childhood cancer treatment
for long-term survivors. The risk is dependent primarily on the treatment used,
but also on the underlying disease. Chemotherapy (especially alkylating agents)
and radiotherapy, even in low doses, may damage the seminiferous epithelium and
impair spermatogenesis in both children and adults. Leydig cell function and
testosterone production are generally preserved after chemotherapy and low dose
radiotherapy, whilst larger doses of radiotherapy may result in hypogonadism.
Patients treated with potentially gonadotoxic treatments require regular
multidisciplinary follow-up including assessment of puberty and gonadal function.
Currently the only option available for fertility preservation in young males
treated for cancer is semen cryopreservation. For pre-pubertal patients,
techniques for fertility preservation remain theoretical and as yet unproven.
These include hormonal manipulation of the gonadal environment before treatment, 
germ cell transplantation and testis xenografting, which have all shown promise
in a variety of animal studies. Refinement of these techniques requires
investigations in relevant animal models. In the present chapter we include data 
which suggest that the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) monkey, a New World
primate, exhibits important parallels with human testicular development and may
help us to understand why the pre-pubertal testis is vulnerable to effects of
cytotoxic therapy on future fertility.

The marmoset model of GB virus B infections: adaptation to host phenotypic
variation.

Research, San Antonio, TX 78227, USA.

Worldwide, approximately 170 million people are chronically infected with
hepatitis C virus (HCV), and chronic infection frequently progresses to serious
liver disease, including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. GB virus B
(GBV-B), the virus phylogenetically most closely related to HCV, causes hepatitis
in tamarins. We have demonstrated the suitability of the tamarin as a host for
GBV-B and as a surrogate nonhuman primate model for HCV infection, and we have
initiated studies of GBV-B infection in a closely related species, the common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). Here, we demonstrate that marmosets exhibit two
phenotypes upon infection with GBV-B: the susceptible phenotype and the partially
resistant phenotype. In addition, we identify changes that may correlate with
adaptation of the virus to the partially resistant host. GBV-B was serially
passaged five times through 14 marmosets as one lineage and two times through 6
marmosets as a second lineage. Virus adapted to the marmosets and eventually
exhibited robust infections in two separate lineages, lineages 1 and 2. A third
lineage was initiated with a molecular clone, and again, susceptible and
partially resistant phenotypes were observed. Three isolates were fully sequenced
(from lineage 1), and 21 nucleotide changes were observed, with six amino acid
changes. We speculate that the marmoset partially resistant phenotype may be due 
to a polymorphism in the marmoset population that affects critical virus-host
interactions and that wild-type GBV-B is capable of rapidly adapting to this
altered host.

Architectural subdivisions of medial and orbital frontal cortices in the marmoset
monkey (Callithrix jacchus).

Although the common marmoset has become a model for the study of several
neurological conditions that affect the frontal lobe, knowledge of the boundaries
of the areas located in the orbital and medial frontal regions has remained
incomplete. Here we examined histological sections stained for myelin, Nissl
substance, and cytochrome oxidase, allowing identification of likely homologues
of most of the architectural fields defined in Old World monkeys. Ventrally, we
identified three granular fields at or near the frontal pole (area 10, and the
medial and lateral subregions of area 11), and two granular fields along the
lateral margin of the orbitofrontal cortex (medial and orbital subdivisions of
area 12). More caudal and medially, dysgranular and agranular cortices included
four subdivisions of area 13 as well as rostral and caudal subdivisions of area
14 (at the ventromedial convexity). The ventral frontotemporal transition
encompassed at least two subdivisions of agranular insular cortex, as well as the
likely homologues of the gustatory cortices. Most of the medial surface was
encompassed by area 10 (which projected a caudomedial finger-like extension
toward the subgenual cortex), together with a relatively large dysgranular area
32 and an agranular area 25 (in subgenual cortex). Finally, the caudal limit of
the medial frontal cortex included two fields of agranular cingulate cortex
(areas 24a and 24b). These findings enhance our understanding of the
architectural organization of the marmoset frontal cortex and highlight a highly 
conserved basic organization across simian primates, allowing the informed
interpretation of experimental neurological studies.

BACKGROUND: Embryonic stem cells (ESC) hold great promise for the treatment of
degenerative diseases. However, before clinical application of ESC in cell
replacement therapy can be achieved, the safety and feasibility must be
extensively tested in animal models. The common marmoset monkey (Callithrix
jacchus) is a useful preclinical non-human primate model due to its physiological
similarities to human. Yet, few marmoset ESC lines exist and differences in their
developmental potential remain unclear.
METHODS: Blastocysts were collected and immunosurgery was performed. cjes001
cells were tested for euploidy by karyotyping. The presence of markers for
pluripotency was confirmed by immunofluorescence staining and RT-PCR. Histology
of teratoma, in vitro differentiation and embryoid body formation revealed the
differentiation potential.
RESULTS: cjes001 cells displayed a normal 46,XX karyotype. Alkaline phosphatase
activity, expression of telomerase and the transcription factors OCT4, NANOG and 
SOX2 as well as the presence of stage-specific embryonic antigen (SSEA)-3,
SSEA-4, tumor rejection antigens (TRA)-1-60, and TRA-1-81 indicated pluripotency.
Teratoma formation assay displayed derivatives of all three embryonic germ
layers. Upon non-directed differentiation, the cells expressed the germ cell
markers VASA, BOULE, germ cell nuclear factor and synaptonemal complex protein 3 
and showed co-localization of VASA protein within individual cells with the germ 
line stem cell markers CD9, CD49f, SSEA-4 and protein gene product 9.5,
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The cjes001 cells represent a new pluripotent ESC line with evidence
for enhanced spontaneous differentiation potential into germ cells. This cjes001 
line will be very valuable for comparative studies on primate ESC biology.

Comparative biology of aging.

Virtually, all research on basic mechanisms of aging has used species that are
short lived and thus demonstrably unsuccessful at combating basic aging
processes. A novel comparative approach would use a diversity of populations and 
species, focusing on those with particularly long, healthy lives, seeking the
causative mechanisms that distinguish them from shorter lived relatives. Species 
of interest from this perspective include the naked mole rat, a mouse-size rodent
that lives up to 30 years in the laboratory, and the little brown bat, which
lives up to 34 years in the wild. Comparisons among dogs of different sizes,
which differ by more than 50% in health span might also prove rewarding, as might
novel species chosen because of their similarity to humans in certain key traits.
Primates, because of their sophisticated cognitive ability, are a group of
special value, and small, short-lived primates like the common marmoset might
prove especially beneficial. Cell repositories and tissue banks from key species,
as well as genomic and analytic tools optimized for comparative studies, would
make valuable contributions to a new comparative approach to basic aging
research.

[(18)F]fluoroacetate for the measurement of glial metabolism by PET.

INTRODUCTION: Changes in glial metabolism in brain ischemia, Alzheimer's disease,
depression, schizophrenia, epilepsy and manganese neurotoxicity have been
reported in recent studies. Therefore, it is very important to measure glial
metabolism in vivo for the elucidation and diagnosis of these diseases.
Radiolabeled acetate is a good candidate for this purpose, but acetate has little
uptake in the brain due to its low lipophilicity. We have designed a new
proradiotracer, ethyl [(18)F]fluoroacetate ([(18)F]EFA), which is
[(18)F]fluoroacetate ([(18)F]FA) esterified with ethanol, to increase the
lipophilicity of fluoroacetate (FA), allowing the measurement of glial
metabolism.
METHODS: The synthesis of [(18)F]EFA was achieved using ethyl O-mesyl-glycolate
as precursor. The blood-brain barrier permeability of ethyl
[1-(14)C]fluoroacetate ([(14)C]EFA) was estimated by a brain uptake index (BUI)
method. Hydrolysis of [(14)C]EFA in the brain was calculated by the fraction of
radioactivity in lipophilic and water fractions of homogenized brain. Using the
plasma of five animal species, the stability of [(14)C]EFA was measured.
Biodistribution studies of [(18)F]EFA in ddY mice were carried out and compared
with [(18)F]FA. Positron emission tomography (PET) scanning using common
marmosets was performed for 90 min postadministration. At 60 min postinjection of
[(18)F]EFA, metabolite studies were performed. Organs were dissected from the
marmosets, and extracted metabolites were analyzed with a thin-layer
chromatography method.
RESULTS: The synthesis of [(18)F]EFA was accomplished in a short time (29 min)
and with a reproducible radiochemical yield of 28.6+/-3.6% (decay corrected) and 
a high radiochemical purity of more than 95%. In the brain permeability study,
the BUI of [(14)C]EFA was 3.8 times higher than that of sodium
[1-(14)C]fluoroacetate. [(14)C]EFA was hydrolyzed rapidly in rat brains. In
stability studies using the plasma of five animal species, [(14)C]EFA was stable 
only in primate plasma. Biodistribution studies in mice showed that the uptake of
[(18)F]EFA in selected organs was higher than that of [(18)F]FA. From nonprimate 
PET studies, [(18)F]EFA was initially taken into the brain after injection.
Metabolites related to the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle were detected in common
marmoset brain.
CONCLUSION: [(18)F]EFA rapidly enters the brain and is then converted into TCA
cycle metabolites in the brains of common marmosets. [(18)F]EFA shows promise as 
a proradiotracer for the measurement of glial metabolism.

Recent studies in rodents have shown that there are significant differences in
gene expression profiles between the hippocampal subregions CA1, CA3, and DG.
These differences in molecular make-up within the hippocampus most likely
underlie the differences in morphology, physiology, and vulnerability to insults 
that exist between the subregions of the hippocampus and are as such part of the 
basic molecular architecture of the hippocampus. The aim of this study was to
investigate at large scale whether these subregional differences in gene
expression are conserved in the hippocampus of a nonhuman primate, the common
marmoset. This study is very timely, given the recent development of the first
marmoset-specific DNA microarray, exclusively containing sequences targeting
transcripts derived from the marmoset hippocampus. Hippocampal subregions CA1,
CA3, and DG were isolated by laser microdissection and RNA was isolated,
amplified, and hybridized to the marmoset-specific microarray (EUMAMA) containing
more than 1,500 transcripts expressed in the adult marmoset hippocampus. Large
differences in expression were observed in particular between the DG region and
both pyramidal subregions. Moreover, the subregion-specific patterns of gene
expression showed a remarkable conservation with the rodent brain both in terms
of individual genes and degree of differential expression. To our knowledge, this
is the first study investigating large scale hippocampal gene expression in a
nonhuman primate. The obtained expression profiles not only provide novel data on
the expression of more than 1,500 transcripts per hippocampal subregion but also 
are of potential interest to neuroscientists interested in the role of the
different subregions in learning and memory in the nonhuman primate brain.

The hormonal induction of cervical remodeling in the common marmoset monkey
(Callithrix jacchus).

Germany.

Controversy still exists regarding the involvement of relaxin (RLX) in cervical
reorganization throughout parturition in the human, despite its well-known role
in facilitating extensive extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling in diverse
organs. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to examine the influence of
RLX and estrogen (E2) on the cervical tissue of the common marmoset monkey. Two
experimental designs were used: 1) in vivo analysis of the intracervical diameter
under locally applied RLX and 2) ovariectomized (ov) marmosets were treated
systemically with either recombinant human (rh) RLX, E2 or rhRLX+E2 to examine
their action on the cervix. In vivo-locally applied rhRLX induced a distinct and 
significant widening of the cervix (before: 4.8+/-1.1 mm versus after: 5.7+/-0.9 
mm in diameter; P<0.030, MV+/-S.E.M.). This widening effect was most pronounced
in animals without previous pregnancies. In vitro investigation of cervical
tissue showed significantly increased wet weights after all three hormone
treatments (E2: 0.27+/-0.07 g, RLX: 0.25+/-0.04 g, E2+RLX: 0.30+/-0.11 g; all
P<0.05; MV+/-S.E.M.) versus controls (0.10+/-0.04 g). Furthermore, morphological 
changes such as loosening of the connective tissue structure and decline in
collagen content, an increase in the number of eosinophils, increased the
expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP1) and MMP2, as well as gene and
protein expression of the RLX receptor RXFP1 could be detected in the cervical
tissue after all hormone treatments, compared with controls. In summary, RLX has 
a potent widening effect on the cervix of the common marmoset monkey. Although E2
is not required for this RLX effect, a combined application of E2 and RLX induced
the most prominent cervical ripening.

We report here for the first time the isolation and identification of the common 
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) huntingtin (Htt) gene, whose ortholog in humans is 
known to be related to Huntington's disease (HD). A 9396 nucleotide complementary
DNA (cDNA) carrying the putative full-length open reading frame of the marmoset
Htt gene was identified, and highly conserved nucleotide and amino acid sequences
among primates were observed. Based on this data and using tools evaluated for
the detection of the marmoset Htt gene, we have demonstrated gene silencing
against the expression of endogenous Htt gene in immortalized common marmoset
mononuclear cells by means of RNA interference (RNAi). Taken together, the data
presented here may assist us in realizing a non-human primate HD model with the
common marmoset.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) as a model for histone and protamine
expression during human spermatogenesis.

Giessen, Germany.

BACKGROUND: Histone to protamine exchange, in man, is only 80% complete and
spermatozoal histones are highly acetylated suggesting that their associated
genes may be involved in early gene expression in the embryo.
METHODS: Using in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry, we analyzed
expression of protamine-1 and protamine-2, and histone H4 specifically acetylated
at lysine 5 (H4K5ac), 8 (H4K8ac), 12 (H4K12ac) and 16 (H4K16ac) in human (n = 22)
and marmoset (n = 6) testes and ejaculates.
RESULTS: Protamine-1 and protamine-2 mRNA was present in round and elongating
spermatids. All antibodies against acetylated histones revealed positive signals 
in these cells. Human spermatogonia showed positive signals for H4K8ac and
H4K16ac, whereas marmoset spermatogonia were positive for H4K8ac and H4K12ac. In 
man, H4K16ac already displayed a positive immunoreaction with pachytene
spermatocytes, starting at stage III of the seminiferous epithelial cycle. All
antibodies showed positive immunostaining in ejaculated spermatozoa of both
species.
CONCLUSIONS: The common marmoset represents a suitable animal model for studies
on nuclear protein expression during human spermatogenesis. The two species
exhibit a similar organization of seminiferous epithelium and an identical
expression pattern of protamine-1 and protamine-2 mRNA in round and elongating
spermatids. The presence of specifically acetylated histones H4 in testicular
spermatids and ejaculated spermatozoa demonstrates an incomplete histone to
protamine exchange in both species. As acetylated histones are known to be
associated with genes involved in gene expression, the common marmoset may, in
future, be used as a model for investigations on early embryo development which, 
in man, are not possible for ethical reasons.

Cortical asymmetries are well established in humans for language and motor
regions and correlate with handedness. Here the authors investigate structural
differences in the hemispheres of left- and right-handed common marmosets using
surface photography and histology. The hand preferences of 11 marmosets were
assessed over their adult life span using a simple reaching task. A significant
correlation was found between the length of the right lateral sulcus/brain weight
and the % right-hand preference (r = .86, p = .001). Cortical thickness on the
superior bank of the right lateral sulcus posteriorly was also positively
correlated with % right-hand preference (r = .69, p = .025). Comparison of this
site with previously published functional maps of the marmoset cortex show this
area corresponds to SII, a region involved in tactile processing and
somatosensory discriminations. It is suggested that the correlation between SII
thickness and right-hand preference would be consistent with the fact that
right-handed marmosets are more proactive than left-handers in exploring novel
objects by touch. Enlargement of a cortical area involved tactile discriminations
could be a precursor to the evolution of right-handedness as a population bias.

Developmental plasticity of the microscopic placental architecture in relation to
litter size variation in the common marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus).

Fetal demand, shaped by factors such as number of fetuses, may alter placental
regulation of exchange, even when maternal nutrition restriction is not overt.
The marmoset is an interesting model in which to examine this aspect of placental
function due to unique placentation that leads to multiple fetuses sharing a
unified placental mass. We demonstrated previously that the triplet marmoset
placenta exhibits significantly higher efficiency than does the twin placenta.
Here, we test the hypothesis that this increased efficiency is due to increases
in changes in the microscopic morphology of the placenta. Stereology was employed
to analyze the microscopic architecture of placentas from twin and triplet
pregnancies. Compartments of interest were the trabeculae, intertrabecular space,
fetal capillaries, and the surface area of the maternal-fetal interface.
Placentas from the two litters did not differ significantly in overall volume or 
individual volumetric compartments, but triplet placentas exhibited significant
expansion of the trabecular surface area in comparison to twins (p=0.039).
Further, the two groups differed in the isomorphy coefficient, with triplet
placentas having a significantly higher coefficient (p=0.001) and potentially a
more complex microscopic topography. Differences in the maternal-fetal interface 
may be due to developmental constraints on gross placental growth that occur
earlier in gestation, such that the only option for maintaining sufficient access
to maternal resources or signaling pathways late in gestation is via an expansion
of the interface. Despite the significant increase in overall surface area,
individual triplet fetuses are associated with much less surface area than are
individual twins, suggestive of alterations in metabolic efficiency, perhaps via 
differential amino acid transport regulation.

PURPOSE: To investigate whether diffusion-tensor tractography (DTT) of neuronal
fibers is useful for delineating the configuration of the neuronal fiber
trajectories in the primate visual pathway, including the well-developed optic
chiasm, in comparison with tract tracing at manganese-enhanced magnetic resonance
(MR) imaging.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The handling methods used for all the animals in this
study were approved by the institutional committee for animal experiments.
Diffusion-tensor MR imaging was performed in four healthy common marmosets, and
in two of these animals, manganese-enhanced MR imaging tract tracing was
performed by using a 7.0-T MR imaging unit. The visual pathways were
quantitatively investigated in terms of the manganese distribution observed on
the manganese-enhanced MR images. The images obtained with DTT and
manganese-enhanced MR imaging tract tracing were qualitatively compared, and the 
features of the visual pathway were verified through fusion of the reconstructed 
images obtained by using these two modalities.
RESULTS: DTT provided information regarding the neuroanatomic features of the
marmoset visual pathway and revealed the bilateral branching patterns of the
typical primate retinogeniculate pathways, although several incorrectly tracked
fibers were noted. The distribution of manganese on the manganese-enhanced MR
images revealed bilateral innervation of the retinal projections and depicted the
layered internal structure of the lateral geniculate nuclei bilaterally,
depending on the ocularity of each layer. These morphologic findings were
consistent with those of previous histopathologic studies.
CONCLUSION: The findings of this preliminary study raise the possibility that DTT
is useful for visualizing the neuronal fiber trajectories in primate visual
pathways.

By using healthy common marmoset monkeys, Yamada et al traced the
retinogeniculate pathways with ultra high-spatial-resolution manganese-enhanced
magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and diffusion-tensor imaging at 7 T. Both methods
were compared with morphologic findings described in published histopathologic
studies. Both methods provided identical tracing of the optic nerve, optic
chiasm, and optic tracts to the level of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN),
faithfully reproducing the crossing of the nasal portion of the optic nerve at
the level of the chiasm into the contralateral optic tract. This study strongly
suggests that diffusion-tensor imaging, a noninvasive method that can be used in 
human research and clinical practice, has the potential to provide accurate
tracing of specific white matter tracts that correspond to actual anatomic and
functional units in the central nervous system.

Human epidemiological studies have indicated that low birth weight associated
with an adverse intrauterine environment is related to a greater incidence of
cardiovascular disorders in later life. In the foetus, endogenous glucocorticoids
generally increase if there is intrauterine nutrient deficiency. The consequent
glucocorticoid hyperexposure has been hypothesised to cause in utero programming 
of atherogenic genes. We investigated the effect of oral treatment with the
synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone during early or late pregnancy in marmoset
monkeys on oxidative and antioxidant status in the offspring. Urinary
concentrations of F(2)-isoprostanes were quantified as markers for in vivo
oxidative stress. Expression of the mRNAs for the antioxidant enzymes cytosolic
glutathione peroxidase (GPx-1), phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase
(GPx-4), cytosolic Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1), mitochondrial Mn-superoxide
dismutase (SOD2), glutathione reductase (GSR), modifier subunit of
glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCLM) and catalase were determined in the aorta. Three
groups of pregnant marmosets (10 animals per group) were treated orally for one
week with vehicle, or with dexamethasone (5 mg/kg daily) during two gestation
windows: early dexamethasone group, pregnancy day 42-48, and late dexamethasone
group, pregnancy day 90-96. In one male sibling of each litter (10 males per
group), aortas were taken at 2 years of age. In the late dexamethasone group a
higher aortic mRNA expression for GPx-1 (p < 0.023), MnSOD (p < 0.016), GCLM (p <
0.019) and GSR (p < 0.014) in comparison to the controls was observed. Aortic
expression in the early dexamethasone group was statistically significantly
higher only for GSR mRNA (p < 0.038). No significant changes in urinary
F(2)-isoprostane concentrations between controls, early and late dexamethasone
groups at 2 years of age were observed. Hence, prenatal exposure to dexamethasone
in the third trimester leads to increased mRNA expression of several aortic
antioxidant enzymes in the offspring. This expression pattern was not temporally 
related to oxidative stress, and it may reflect in utero re-programming of aortic
antioxidant gene expression during prenatal glucocorticoid exposure.

Callithrix jacchus, the common marmoset, is a small new world primate that is
considered effective as an experimental animal model for various human diseases. 
In this study, we generated monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against common marmoset 
lymphocytes for immunological studies on the common marmoset. We established five
hybridoma clones, 6C9, 10D7, 6F10, 7A4 and 5A1, producing anti-marmoset mAbs
against cell surface antigens on marmoset T and/or B lymphocytes. We confirmed
that 6C9 and 10D7 antibodies recognized CD45 antigen, and 6F10 antibody
recognized CD8 antigen by flow cytometry using marmoset cDNA transfectants. We
also tested them for application of immunoprecipitation, Western blot analysis
and immunohistochemistry. We found that immunohistochemistry using marmoset
spleen sections could be applied with all established mAbs but
immunoprecipitation and the Western blot analysis could be applied with 6F10 and 
10D7 antibodies but not with the other three mAbs. These results show that these 
monoclonal antibodies are useful for advancing immunological research on the
common marmoset.

Nanoparticles, including lipopolyamines leading to lipoplexes, liposomes, and
polyplexes are targeted drug carrier systems in the current search for a
successful delivery system for polynucleic acids. This review is focused on the
impact of gene and siRNA delivery for studies of efficacy, pharmacodynamics, and 
pharmacokinetics within the setting of the wide variety of in vivo animal models 
now used. This critical appraisal of the recent literature sets out the different
models that are currently being investigated to bridge from studies in cell lines
through towards clinical reality. Whilst many scientists will be familiar with
rodent (murine, fecine, cricetine, and musteline) models, few probably think of
fish as a clinically relevant animal model, but zebrafish, madake, and rainbow
trout are all being used. Larger animal models include rabbit, cat, dog, and cow.
Pig is used both for the prevention of foot-and-mouth disease and human diseases,
sheep is a model for corneal transplantation, and the horse naturally develops
arthritis. Non-human primate models (macaque, common marmoset, owl monkey) are
used for preclinical gene vector safety and efficacy trials to bridge the gap
prior to clinical studies. We aim for the safe development of clinically
effective delivery systems for DNA and RNAi technologies.

Synthetic glucocorticoids such as dexamethasone (DEX) are commonly used to
prevent respiratory distress syndrome in preterm infants, but there is emerging
evidence of subsequent neurobehavioral abnormalities (e.g. problems with
inattention/hyperactivity). In the present study, we exposed pregnant common
marmosets (Callithrix jacchus, primates) to daily repeated DEX (5 mg/kg by mouth)
during either early (d 42-48) or late (d 90-96) pregnancy (gestation period of
144 days). Relative to control, and with a longitudinal design, we investigated
DEX effects in offspring in terms of physical growth, plasma ACTH and cortisol
titers, social and maintenance behaviors, skilled motor reaching, motivation for 
palatable reward, and learning between infancy and adolescence. Early DEX
resulted in reduced sociability in infants and increased motivation for palatable
reward in adolescents. Late DEX resulted in a mild transient increase in
knee-heel length in infants and enhanced reversal learning of stimulus-reward
association in adolescents. There was no effect of either early or late DEX on
basal plasma ACTH or cortisol titers. Both treatments resulted in impaired
skilled motor reaching in juveniles, which attenuated in early DEX but persisted 
in late DEX across test sessions. The increased palatable-reward motivation and
decreased social motivation observed in early DEX subjects provide experimental
support for the clinical reports that prenatal glucocorticoid treatment impairs
social development and predisposes to metabolic syndrome. These novel primate
findings indicate that fetal glucocorticoid overexposure can lead to abnormal
development of motor, affective, and cognitive behaviors. Importantly, the
outcome is highly dependent upon the timing of glucocorticoid overexposure.

Common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) males are bi-parental non-human primates
that show extensive paternal behaviour. Fathers are in direct sensory contact
with their infants during the natal period. We found that fathers exposed to
isolated scents of their infant displayed a significant drop in serum
testosterone levels within 20min after exposure, whereas parentally naive males
did not. These data suggest that infant's scent may have a causal role in
regulating paternal testosterone in their fathers. This is the first study to
demonstrate that olfactory cues have an acute effect on paternal care.

Common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) as a potential animal model for studying
psychological disorders associated with high and low responsiveness of the

Social non-human primates are potential animal models for studying changes in
social dynamics because they build strong emotional bonds inside the group, much 
as do humans. The common marmoset, a small neotropical primate, is a suitable
model because of its low maintenance cost and high reproductive output in
captivity associated with the presence of affiliative relationships among the
members of the social group and pair bond formation. The paradigm of involuntary 
separation is frequently used to study the physiological repercussions of social 
deprivation. In this review we point out the advantages of using social non-human
primates as animal models for studying psychological disorders. We focused on New
World primates, adding some original findings for common marmosets. Forty-eight
adult individuals (24 females) were monitored over 25 days in two situations:
baseline phase and separation phase. Variability in basal cortisol levels was
recorded for both males and females, and three types of cortisol profile were
drawn for the subjects in this population: high, medium and low. Basal cortisol
levels were a predictor of hormonal reactivity to social separation. The animals 
with low and high cortisol levels were hyper- and hyporeactive to separation,
respectively. Significant positive correlations between hormonal reactivity and
scent-marking behavior were found for low profile males and females. These
findings show that common marmosets display behavioral changes during challenging
situations and different cortisol profiles within a population. Thus, this
species appears to be a suitable animal model for studying mental disorders
associated with high and low responsiveness of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
axis.

The gene transduction method is a very powerful tool, not only in basic science
but also in clinical medicine. Regenerative medicine is one field that has close 
connection with both basic and clinical. Recently, it has been reported that
induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells can be produced from somatic cells by a
three or four gene transduction. We have also recently reported that lentiviral
gene transfer of the tal1/scl gene can efficiently differentiate non-human
primate common marmoset ES cells into hematopoietic cells without the support of 
stromal cells. In this study, we constructed a high-performance human fetal
liver-derived lentiviral expression library, which contains a high number of
individual clones, in order to develop a very helpful tool for understanding
early hematopoiesis and/or hepatocytosis for future regenerative medicine. Our
lentiviral cDNA library consisted of more than 8 x 10(7) individual clones, and
their average insert size was >2 kb. DNA sequence analysis for each individual
inserted cDNAs revealed that >60% contained the full-length protein-coding
regions for many genes including cytokine receptors, cytoplasmic proteins,
protein inhibitors, and nuclear factors. The transduction efficiency on 293T
cells was 100% and the average size of an integrated cDNA was ~1.1 kb. These
results suggest that our lentiviral human fetal liver cDNA expression library
could be a very helpful tool for accelerating the discovery of novel genes that
are involved in early hematopoiesis and hepatopoiesis and to make the use of iPS 
cells more efficient in the field of regenerative medicine.

Traditional retinal projections target three functionally complementary systems
in the brain of mammals: the primary visual system, the visuomotor integration
systems and the circadian timing system. In recent years, studies in several
animals have been conducted to investigate the retinal projections to these three
systems, despite some evidence of additional targets. The aim of this study was
to disclose a previously unknown connection between the retina and the
parabrachial complex of the common marmoset, by means of the intraocular
injection of cholera toxin subunit b. A few labeled retinal fibers/terminals that
are detected in the medial parabrachial portion of the marmoset brain show clear 
varicosities, suggesting terminal fields. Although the possible role of these
projections remains unknown, they may provide a modulation of the cholinergic
parabrachial neurons which project to the thalamic dorsal lateral geniculate
nucleus.

Glycan stem-cell markers are specifically expressed by spermatogonia in the adult
non-human primate testis.

BACKGROUND: The glycan cell surface molecules, stage-specific embryonic antigen
(SSEA)-1, -3 and -4 and tumor-rejection antigen (TRA)-1-60 and -1-81, are
expressed in specific combinations by undifferentiated pluripotent cells, i.e.
embryonic stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells, embryonal carcinoma cells, 
primordial germ cells and embryonic germ cells. Upon differentiation of the
cells, these markers vanish. Recently, it has been shown that also neonatal and
adult mouse testes contain pluripotent cells. Here, we aimed at identifying in
situ possibly pluripotent cells in the adult primate testis.
METHODS: Monoclonal antibodies raised against the glyco-epitopes SSEA-1, -3 and
-4 and TRA-1-60 and -1-81, respectively, were tested to detect cells expressing
the antigens, by immunohistochemistry on Bouin's-fixed and paraffin-embedded
adult primate testes. Man, the new-world monkey, Callithrix jacchus (common
marmoset), and the old-world monkey species, Macaca mulatta (Rhesus macaque) and 
Macaca silenus (Lion-tailed macaque), were included. The percentage of
SSEA-4-positive cells in three adult marmoset testes was determined using flow
cytometry.
RESULTS: Spermatogonia in the testes of C. jacchus were labeled by SSEA-4,
TRA-1-60 and -1-81-antibodies. In the macaques, spermatogonia were detected by
SSEA-4 and TRA-1-81-antibodies. TRA-1-61 did not bind to macaque spermatogonia.
Also, SSEA-1 and -3 did not bind to spermatogonia in any species. In human
testes, we never obtained any clear staining. The total percentage of
SSEA-4-positive cells in marmoset testes was 8.6 +/- 1.61%.
CONCLUSIONS: SSEA-4 and TRA-1-81-antibodies may be very well suited for the
identification and isolation of spermatogonia, and possibly also germline stem
cells, in the non-human primate testis.

Early parental deprivation in the marmoset monkey produces long-term changes in
hippocampal expression of genes involved in synaptic plasticity and implicated in
mood disorder.

In mood disorder, early stressors including parental separation are vulnerability
factors, and hippocampal involvement is prominent. In common marmoset monkeys,
daily parental deprivation during infancy produces a prodepressive state of
increased basal activity and reactivity in stress systems and mild anhedonia that
persists at least to adolescence. Here we examined the expression of eight genes,
each implicated in neural plasticity and in the pathophysiology of mood disorder,
in the hippocampus of these same adolescent marmosets, relative to their normally
reared sibling controls. We also measured hippocampal volume. Early deprivation
led to decreases in hippocampal growth-associated protein-43 (GAP-43) mRNA,
serotonin 1A receptor (5-HT(1A)R) mRNA and binding ([3H]WAY100635), and to
increased vesicular GABA transporter mRNA. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor
(BDNF), synaptophysin, vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGluT1),
microtubule-associated protein-2, and spinophilin transcripts were unchanged.
There were some correlations with in vivo biochemical and behavioral indices,
including VGluT1 mRNA with reward-seeking behavior, and serotonin 1A receptor
mRNA with CSF cortisol. Early deprivation did not affect hippocampal volume. We
conclude that early deprivation in a nonhuman primate, in the absence of
subsequent stressors, has a long-term effect on the hippocampal expression of
genes implicated in synaptic function and plasticity. The reductions in GAP-43
and serotonin 1A receptor expressions are comparable with findings in mood
disorder, supporting the possibility that the latter reflect an early
developmental contribution to disease vulnerability. Equally, the negative
results suggest that other features of mood disorder, such as decreased
hippocampal volume and BDNF expression, are related to different aspects of the
pathophysiological process.

Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) produces the most severe human arboviral
disease in North America (NA) and is a potential biological weapon. However,
genetically and antigenically distinct strains from South America (SA) have
seldom been associated with human disease or mortality despite serological
evidence of infection. Because mice and other small rodents do not respond
differently to the NA versus SA viruses like humans, we tested common marmosets
(Callithrix jacchus) by using intranasal infection and monitoring for weight
loss, fever, anorexia, depression, and neurologic signs. The NA EEEV-infected
animals either died or were euthanized on day 4 or 5 after infection due to
anorexia and neurologic signs, but the SA EEEV-infected animals remained healthy 
and survived. The SA EEEV-infected animals developed peak viremia titers of 2.8
to 3.1 log(10) PFU/ml on day 2 or 4 after infection, but there was no detectable 
viremia in the NA EEEV-infected animals. In contrast, virus was detected in the
brain, liver, and muscle of the NA EEEV-infected animals at the time of
euthanasia or death. Similar to the brain lesions described for human EEE, the NA
EEEV-infected animals developed meningoencephalitis in the cerebral cortex with
some perivascular hemorrhages. The findings of this study identify the common
marmoset as a useful model of human EEE for testing antiviral drugs and vaccine
candidates and highlight their potential for corroborating epidemiological
evidence that some, if not all, SA EEEV strains are attenuated for humans.

Distortion-product otoacoustic emissions in the common marmoset (Callithrix
jacchus): parameter optimization.

Distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) were measured in a New World
primate, the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). We determined the optimal
primary-tone frequency ratio (f(2)/f(1)) to generate DPOAEs of maximal amplitude 
between 3 and 24 kHz. The optimal f(2)/f(1), determined by varying f(2)/f(1) from
1.02 to 1.40 using equilevel primary tones, decreased with increasing f(2)
frequency between 3 and 17 kHz, and increased at 24 kHz. The optimal f(2)/f(1)
ratio increased with increasing primary-tone levels from 50 to 74 dB SPL. When
all stimulus parameters were considered, the mean optimal f(2)/f(1) was
1.224-1.226. Additionally, we determined the effect of reducing L(2) below L(1). 
Decreasing L(2) below L(1) by 0, 5, and 10 dB (f(2)/f(1)=1.21) minimally affected
DPOAE strength. DPOAE levels were stronger in females than males and stronger in 
the right ear than the left, just as in humans. This study is the first to
measure OAEs in the marmoset, and the results indicate that the effect of varying
the frequency ratio and primary-tone level difference on marmoset DPOAEs is
similar to the reported effects in humans and Old World primates.

In the evolution of primates, the common marmoset belongs to the new world monkey
family and is distinct from the great ape family (which includes humans). In this
study, we predicted the amino acid sequences of 30 immunity-related genes from
the common marmoset and compared them with those from human and mouse. The domain
composition of each orthologous protein was analyzed by the SMART tool and was
found to be the same among the three species. A BLAST search revealed that the
common marmoset and human proteins were 86% identical on average, whereas the
conservation between the common marmoset and mouse or between the human and mouse
was only 60%. This indicates that the common marmoset and human proteins are
closely related and are similarly divergent from the mouse. We divided the 30
proteins into two categories based on the degree of conservation between the
common marmoset and mouse amino acid sequences. One group included 19 proteins
and had a relatively high level of conservation (68% identical), whereas the
other 11 proteins were less conserved (45% identical). This suggests that these
immunity-related genes do not evolve at a uniform rate. Interestingly, however,
ligand/receptor pairs such as interleukin-6 and interleukin-6 receptor appear to 
have evolved simultaneously.

We describe a cost- and time-efficient method for designing new microsatellite
markers in any species with substantial genomic DNA sequence data available.
Using this technique, we report 14 new polymorphic dinucleotide microsatellite
loci isolated from the common marmoset. The relative yield of new polymorphisms
was higher with less labor than described in previous marmoset studies. Of 20
loci initially evaluated, 14 were polymorphic and amplified reliably (70% success
rate). The number of alleles ranged from 3 to 9 with heterozygosity varying from 
0.48 to 0.83.

Patent and pathologic infections of the human hookworm Necator americanus were
established in the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). In a pilot study, a
laboratory strain of N. americanus was compared with a fresh field isolate.
Pathology was more severe in animals infected with a fresh isolate. In all
animals, infection was associated with increased total plasma IgE and production 
of IgG specific to adult worm excretory/secretory (ES) products. Histamine was
released by basophils in response to IgE, ES products, and a recombinant hookworm
allergen, calreticulin. The pilot study indicated the potential of this animal
model of hookworm infection and led us to investigate the consequences of
infecting a further cohort with the fresh field isolate. This second study
confirmed our initial findings, that it is possible to investigate the human
hookworm N. americanus in a model exhibiting many of the characteristics of the
immunology of hookworm infection in its definitive host.

The hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and the thalamic intergeniculate
leaflet (IGL) are considered to be the main centers of the mammalian circadian
timing system. In primates, the IGL is included as part of the pregeniculate
nucleus (PGN), a cell group located mediodorsally to the dorsal lateral
geniculate nucleus. This work was carried out to comparatively evaluate the
immunohistochemical expression of the calcium-binding proteins calbindin D-28k
(CB), parvalbumin (PV), and calretinin (CR) into the circadian brain districts of
the common marmoset and the rock cavy. In both species, although no fibers,
terminals or perikarya showed PV-immunoreaction (IR) into the SCN, CB-IR
perikarya labeling was detected throughout the SCN rostrocaudal extent, seeming
to delimit its cytoarchitectonic borders. CR-IR perikarya and neuropil were
noticed into the ventral and dorsal portions of the SCN, lacking immunoreactivity
in the central core of the marmoset and filling the entire nucleus in the rock
cavy. The PGN of the marmoset presented a significant number of CB-, PV-, and
CR-IR perikarya throughout the nucleus. The IGL of the rocky cavy exhibited a
prominent CB- and CR-IR neuropil, showing similarity to the pattern found in
other rodents. By comparing with literature data from other mammals, the results 
of the present study suggest that CB, PV, and CR are differentially distributed
into the SCN and IGL among species. They may act either in concert or in a
complementary manner in the SCN and IGL, so as to participate in specific aspects
of the circadian regulation.

Expression of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase in the rhesus monkey and common
marmoset.

Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) catalyzes the initial and rate-limiting step of
tryptophan degradation along the kynurenine pathway, and is hypothesized to limit
tryptophan availability at embryo implantation and prevent maternal T cell
activation at the maternal-fetal interface. To determine if nonhuman primates are
suitable models for investigating the role of IDO during pregnancy, we defined
the expression of IDO in the rhesus monkey and common marmoset with particular
attention to the female reproductive tract and placenta. IDO mRNA was detected by
RT-PCR in the rhesus monkey term placenta, lung, small intestine, spleen, lymph
node and nonpregnant uterus, and also in the common marmoset placenta.
Immunohistochemical analysis of rhesus monkey tissues localized IDO to glandular 
epithelium of nonpregnant endometrium and first trimester decidua, vessel
endothelium of nonpregnant myometrium, first trimester decidua and term decidua, 
and villous vessel endothelium and syncytiotrophoblast of term placenta. Western 
blot analysis confirmed IDO in rhesus monkey term placenta. In the common
marmoset, IDO was detected in glandular epithelium of the nonpregnant uterus and 
in the decidua at day 60 and day 128 of gestation. IDO activity was higher in
rhesus monkey and common marmoset decidua and placentas than in other tissues.
Confirmation of IDO expression in rhesus monkey and common marmoset uterine and
placental tissues supports the hypothesis that this enzyme regulates immune
activation at the maternal-fetal interface and demonstrates that nonhuman
primates may provide models with distinct similarities to human placentation to
study the role of IDO in maternal-fetal immune dialogue.

Simple, rapid and stable sperm evaluation methods which have been optimized for
common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) are critical for studies involving
collection and evaluation of sperm in the field. This is particularly important
for new species groups such as Callitrichidae where the sperm have been little
studied. Of this family, C. jacchus is the best known, and has been chosen as a
model species for other members of the genus Callithrix. The fundamental
evaluation parameters for sperm of any species are viability and acrosomal
status. Semen samples were collected by penile vibratory stimulation. To evaluate
sperm plasma membrane integrity, Eosin-Nigrosin was tested here for the common
marmoset sperm to be used under field conditions. Further, a non-fluorescent
stain for acrosome, the "Simple" stain, developed for domestic and wild cats, was
tested on common marmoset sperm. This was compared with a fluorescent staining,
Fluorescein isothiocyanate-Pisum sativum agglutinin (FITC-PSA), routinely used
and validated for common marmoset at the German Primate Centre to evaluate
acrosomal integrity. Results obtained with the "Simple" stain showed a marked
differentiation between sperm with intact and non-intact acrosome both with and
without ionophore treatment and closely correlated with results obtained with
FITC-PSA. Temperature had no effect on the results with the "Simple" stain and
the complete processing is simple enough to be carried out under field
conditions. These findings indicated that the "Simple" stain and Eosin-Nigrosin
provide rapid and accurate results for C. jacchus sperm and that those methods
can be reliably used as field tools for sperm evaluation for this species.

Different ovarian responses to potential mates underlie species-specific breeding
strategies in common marmoset and Goeldi's monkey.

Callitrichids are cooperative breeders, characterized by obligate twinning,
extensive paternal care, and monopolization of reproduction by the dominant
female. This is the case in the common marmoset, and in common marmoset groups of
more than one adult female, subordinate females are typically acyclic consistent 
with infertility. However, one callitrichid, Goeldi's monkey, gives birth to
singletons and exhibits low paternal care. Given these reproductive traits of
Goeldi's monkey, we hypothesized that there would not be suppression of ovarian
activity. To test this hypothesis, we applied non-invasive endocrine methods in a
step-wise experiment with laboratory groups of both species. In each species, six
pairs of sisters were studied alone, in visual contact with an unrelated male and
in a polygynous trio with the male, and urine samples were collected for
determination of oestrogen titres reflecting ovarian activity. Common marmoset
sister pairs exhibited a marked difference in social status: during the study 5
of 6 dominant females conceived but only 1 of 6 subordinate females; the
remaining 5 subordinates were acyclic at the end of the study, and instances of
ovulation typically resulted in aggression. Goeldi's monkey sister pairs showed
no status differences: in all pairs, however, both sisters exhibited a temporary 
cessation of ovarian cyclicity on trio formation, followed by ovulation and
conception. We conclude that these marked differences in ovarian responses
reflect the differences in inter-female competition for paternal caregiving
resources. In common marmosets with high inter-female competition, suppression of
ovulation functions to reduce aggression received by subordinate females; in
Goeldi's monkey with low competition, temporary cessation of ovulation could
facilitate female choice.

Placental efficiency and intrauterine resource allocation strategies in the
common marmoset pregnancy.

University, Evanston, Illinois 60208, USA. julienne-rutherford@northwestern.edu

Mothers and fetuses are expected to be in some degree of conflict over the
allocation of maternal resources to fetal growth in the intrauterine environment.
Variation in placental structure and function may be one way a fetus can
communicate need and quality to its mother, potentially manipulating maternal
investment in its favor. Whereas common marmosets typically produce twin litters,
they regularly give birth to triplet litters in captivity. The addition of
another fetus is a potential drain on maternal resource availability and thus a
source of elevated conflict over resource allocation. Marmoset littermates share 
a single placental mass, so that differences in the ratio of fetal to placental
weight across litter categories suggest the presence of differential intrauterine
strategies of resource allocation. The fetal/placental weight ratio was
calculated for 26 marmoset pregnancies, representing both twin and triplet
litters, to test the hypothesis that triplet fetuses respond to intrauterine
conflict by soliciting placental overgrowth as a means of accessing maternal
resources. In fact, relative to fetal mass, the triplet marmoset placenta is
significantly undergrown, with individual triplets associated with less placental
mass than their twin counterparts, suggesting that the triplet placenta is
relatively more efficient in its support of fetal growth. There still may be an
important role for maternal-fetal conflict in the programming of placental
structure and function. Placental adaptations that solicit potential increases of
maternal investment may occur at the microscopic or metabolic level, and thus may
not be reflected in the size of the placenta as a whole.

The generation of expressed sequence tag (EST) libraries offers an affordable
approach to investigate organisms, if no genome sequence is available. OREST
(http://mips.gsf.de/genre/proj/orest/index.html) is a server-based EST analysis
pipeline, which allows the rapid analysis of large amounts of ESTs or cDNAs from 
mammalia and fungi. In order to assign the ESTs to genes or proteins OREST maps
DNA sequences to reference datasets of gene products and in a second step to
complete genome sequences. Mapping against genome sequences recovers additional
13% of EST data, which otherwise would escape further analysis. To enable
functional analysis of the datasets, ESTs are functionally annotated using the
hierarchical FunCat annotation scheme as well as GO annotation terms. OREST also 
allows to predict the association of gene products and diseases by Morbid Map
(OMIM) classification. A statistical analysis of the results of the dataset is
possible with the included PROMPT software, which provides information about
enrichment and depletion of functional and disease annotation terms. OREST was
successfully applied for the identification and functional characterization of
more than 3000 EST sequences of the common marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus)
as part of an international collaboration.

Inhalational anthrax is a rare but potentially fatal infection in man. The common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) was evaluated as a small non-human primate (NHP)
model of inhalational anthrax infection, as an alternative to larger NHP species.
The marmoset was found to be susceptible to inhalational exposure to Bacillus
anthracis Ames strain. The pathophysiology of infection following inhalational
exposure was similar to that previously reported in the rhesus and cynomolgus
macaque and humans. The calculated LD(50) for B. anthracis Ames strain in the
marmoset was 1.47 x 10(3) colony-forming units, compared with a published LD(50) 
of 5.5 x 10(4) spores in the rhesus macaque and 4.13 x 10(3) spores in the
cynomolgus macaque. This suggests that the common marmoset is an appropriate
alternative NHP and will be used for the evaluation of medical countermeasures
against respiratory anthrax infection.

PURPOSE: To assess the use of visual evoked potentials (VEPs) for the in vivo
detection of impaired visual function in a marmoset model of multiple sclerosis. 
The sensitivity of the VEP recordings was determined by comparison with magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) and histopathology.
METHODS: Baseline VEPs were recorded in six healthy marmoset monkeys in response 
to light-flash stimulation. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) was
induced in four of the six monkeys. Clinical scores were assessed daily, and VEPs
were recorded every second week. In vivo MRI and subsequent histopathology of the
brains and optic nerves were performed at the end of the study.
RESULTS: After induction of EAE, all four marmosets exhibited clinical signs
between day 26 and 38 after immunization. VEPs were normal during the induction
phase of the disease, but deteriorated in amplitude with the occurrence of
clinical symptoms in all animals. MRI revealed bilateral optic neuritis and
signal alterations in the optic tracts and occipital subcortical white matter in 
two of the animals. In the remaining two animals, MRI detected signal alterations
in the occipital subcortical white matter. Histopathologic results were
concordant with the MRI findings.
CONCLUSIONS: VEPs are an easily accessible noninvasive tool for measuring visual 
function and diagnosing impairment of the visual pathway in a marmoset EAE model.

No long-term effect two years after intrauterine exposure to dexamethasone on

Glucocorticoids are prenatally administered to promote the maturation of the
lungs. They, however, can affect neuronal proliferation and differentiation. In
newborn marmoset monkeys, intrauterine hyperexposure to dexamethasone (DEX)
resulted in a significantly decreased proliferation rate in the hippocampal
dentate gyrus without affecting neuronal differentiation. In this study, marmoset
monkeys received 5 mg/kg body weight DEX either during early (days 42-48) or late
(days 90-96) pregnancy. The volume of the dentate granule cell layer as well as
the proliferation and neuronal differentiation in the dentate gyrus of their
2-year-old offspring were investigated. The density of proliferating cells
(Ki-67), apoptotic cells (in situ tailing) and cells differentiating to neurons
(double cortin, TUC-4 and calretinin) were determined immunohistochemically.
Analysis of the dentate granule cell layer volume showed no significant
differences between early or late DEX-exposed marmosets and untreated control
animals. Similarly, proliferation and neuronal differentiation in DEX-treated
animals was not significantly different in comparison with controls. In summary, 
the decreased proliferation rate observed in newborn marmosets after intrauterine
exposure to DEX was no longer detectable in their 2-year-old siblings suggesting 
no long-lasting effect of prenatal hyperexposure to DEX on neuronal proliferation
and differentiation in the dentate gyrus of marmoset monkeys.

To elucidate the pathogenetic significance of myelin/oligodendrocyte glycoprotein
(MOG)-specific autoreactivity in a genetically and immunologically heterogeneous 
nonhuman primate model of multiple sclerosis, we analyzed experimental autoimmune
encephalomyelitis (EAE) in the outbred common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). One 
sibling each of 5 bone marrow chimeric marmoset twins was immunized with myelin
derived from wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 mice (WT myelin); the other sibling was
immunized with myelin from MOG-deficient C57BL/6 mice (MOG -/- myelin). One twin 
pair developed acute EAE simultaneously; the 4 remaining twin siblings immunized 
with WT myelin developed chronic progressive EAE, whereas siblings of these 4
monkeys remained free of clinical disease signs. Many EAE-related abnormalities
were identified in the CNS of both groups by magnetic resonance imaging and
histologic analysis, but mean percentages of spinal cord demyelination were lower
in monkeys immunized with MOG -/- myelin (8.2%) than in WT myelin-immunized
animals (40.5%). There was a strong correlation between the development of overt 
clinical EAE and seropositivity for anti-MOG antibodies, but blood and lymph node
T-cell proliferative responses showed no relationship to disease. These results
indicate that the initiation of CNS inflammation and demyelination can take place
in the absence of detectable autoimmunity against MOG, but the clinical
progression and histopathologic severity depends on the presence of antibodies
against MOG in this multiple sclerosis model.

Common marmoset monkeys have recently attracted much attention as a primate
research model, and are preferred to rhesus and cynomolgus monkeys due to their
small bodies, easy handling and efficient breeding. We recently reported the
establishment of common marmoset embryonic stem cell (CMESC) lines that could
differentiate into three germ layers. Here, we report that our CMESC can also
differentiate into cardiomyocytes and investigated their characteristics. After
induction, FOG-2 was expressed, followed by GATA4 and Tbx20, then Nkx2.5 and
Tbx5. Spontaneous beating could be detected at days 12-15. Immunofluorescent
staining and ultrastructural analyses revealed that they possessed
characteristics typical of functional cardiomyocytes. They showed sinus node-like
action potentials, and the beating rate was augmented by isoproterenol
stimulation. The BrdU incorporation assay revealed that CMESC-derived
cardiomyocytes retained a high proliferative potential for up to 24 weeks. We
believe that CMESC-derived cardiomyocytes will advance preclinical studies in
cardiovascular regenerative medicine.

Manganese overexposure in non-human primates and humans causes a
neurodegenerative disorder called manganism thought to be related to an
accumulation of the metal in the basal ganglia. Here, we assess changes in the
concentration of manganese in regions of the brain of a non-human primate (the
common marmoset, Callithrix jacchus) following four systemic injections of 30
mg/kg MnCl2 H2O in the tail vein using T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) and compare these to changes in the rat following the same exposure route
and dose. The doses were spaced 48 h apart and we imaged the animals 48 h after
the final dose. We find that marmosets have significantly larger T1-weighted
image enhancements in regions of the brain compared to rats, notably in the basal
ganglia and the visual cortex. To confirm this difference across species reflects
actual differences in manganese concentrations and not variations in the MRI
properties of manganese, we measured the longitudinal relaxivity of manganese
(chi1) in the in vivo brain and found no significant species' difference. The
high manganese uptake in the marmoset basal ganglia and visual cortex can be
explained by CSF-brain transport from the large lateral ventricles and we confirm
this route of uptake with time-course MRI during a tail-vein infusion of
manganese. There is also high uptake in the substructures of the hippocampus that
are adjacent to the ventricles. The large manganese accumulation in these
structures on overexposure may be common to all primates, including humans.

OBJECTIVE: CYP3A metabolizes 50% of currently prescribed drugs and is frequently 
involved in clinically relevant drug interactions. The understanding of roles and
regulations of the individual CYP3A genes in pharmacology and physiology is
incomplete.
METHODS: Using genomic sequences from 16 species we investigated the evolution of
CYP3 genomic loci over a period of 450 million years.
RESULTS: CYP3A genes in amniota evolved from two ancestral CYP3A genes. Upon the 
emergence of eutherian mammals, one of them was lost, whereas, the other acquired
a novel genomic environment owing to translocation. In primates, CYP3A underwent 
rapid evolutionary changes involving multiple gene duplications, deletions,
pseudogenizations, and gene conversions. The expansion of CYP3A in catarrhines
(Old World monkeys, great apes, and humans) differed substantially from New World
primates (e.g. common marmoset) and strepsirrhines (e.g. galago). We detected two
recent episodes of particularly strong positive selection acting on primate CYP3A
protein-coding sequence: (i) on CYP3A7 early in hominoid evolution, which was
accompanied by a restriction of its hepatic expression to fetal period and (ii)
on human CYP3A4 following the split of the chimpanzee and human lineages. In
agreement with these findings, three out of four positively selected amino acids 
investigated in previous biochemical studies of CYP3A affect the activity and
regioselectivity.
CONCLUSIONS: CYP3A7 and CYP3A4 may have acquired catalytic functions especially
important for the evolution of hominoids and humans, respectively.

The recombinant human (rh) myelin/oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-induced
experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model in the common marmoset is
characterized by 100% disease incidence, a chronic disease course, and a variable
time interval between immunization and neurological impairment. We investigated
whether monkeys with fast and slow disease progression display different anti-MOG
T or B cell responses and analyzed the underlying pathogenic mechanism(s). The
results show that fast progressor monkeys display a significantly wider
specificity diversification of anti-MOG T cells at necropsy than slow
progressors, especially against MOG(34-56) and MOG(74-96). MOG(34-56) emerged as 
a critical encephalitogenic peptide, inducing severe neurological disease and
multiple lesions with inflammation, demyelination, and axonal injury in the CNS. 
Although EAE was not observed in MOG(74-96)-immunized monkeys, weak T cell
responses against MOG(34-56) and low grade CNS pathology were detected. When
these cases received a booster immunization with MOG(34-56) in IFA, full-blown
EAE developed. MOG(34-56)-reactive T cells expressed CD3, CD4, or CD8 and CD56,
but not CD16. Moreover, MOG(34-56)-specific T cell lines displayed specific
cytotoxic activity against peptide-pulsed B cell lines. The phenotype and
cytotoxic activity suggest that these cells are NK-CTL. These results support the
concept that cytotoxic cells may play a role in the pathogenesis of multiple
sclerosis.

Necropsy of a 17-month-old male common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) with a
history of increased abdominal girth resulted in the finding of a unilateral
polycystic renal neoplasm. Detailed histopathologic and immunohistochemical
investigations revealed different tissue types within the tumor including stromal
connective tissue and fusiform mesenchymal cell formations surrounding blastemal 
cells as well as different developmental stages of organ-specific epithelial
cells accompanied by extensive cyst formation. Metastases were not observed. In
consideration of the macroscopic, histologic, and immunohistochemical findings,
the tumor was classified as a nephroblastoma closely resembling the so-called
Wilms' tumor, a malignant embryonic renal tumor frequently observed in humans,
especially in young children. In contrast, this tumor entity has rarely been
observed in nonhuman primates. This report represents the first documented case
of a cystic variant of nephroblastoma in a nonhuman primate.

Microstimulation and architectonics of frontoparietal cortex in common marmosets 
(Callithrix jacchus).

We investigated the organization of frontoparietal cortex in the common marmoset 
(Callithrix jacchus) by using intracortical microstimulation and an architectonic
analysis. Primary motor cortex (M1) was identified as an area that evoked visible
movements at low levels of electric current and had a full body representation of
the contralateral musculature. Primary motor cortex represented the contralateral
body from hindlimb to face in a mediolateral sequence, with individual movements 
such as jaw and wrist represented in multiple nearby locations. Primary motor
cortex was coextensive with an agranular area of cortex marked by a distinct
layer V of large pyramidal cells that gradually decreased in size toward the
rostral portion of the area and was more homogenous in appearance than other New 
World primates. In addition to M1, stimulation also evoked movements from several
other areas of frontoparietal cortex. Caudal to primary motor cortex, area 3a was
identified as a thin strip of cortex where movements could be evoked at
thresholds similar to those in M1. Rostral to primary motor cortex, supplementary
motor cortex and premotor areas responded to higher stimulation currents and had 
smaller layer V pyramidal cells. Other areas evoking movements included primary
somatosensory cortex (area 3b), two lateral somatosensory areas (areas PV and
S2), and a caudal somatosensory area. Our results suggest that frontoparietal
cortex in marmosets is organized in a similar fashion to that of other New World 
primates.

Other-regarding preferences in a non-human primate: common marmosets provision
food altruistically.

Human cooperation is unparalleled in the animal world and rests on an altruistic 
concern for the welfare of genetically unrelated strangers. The evolutionary
roots of human altruism, however, remain poorly understood. Recent evidence
suggests a discontinuity between humans and other primates because individual
chimpanzees do not spontaneously provide food to other group members, indicating 
a lack of concern for their welfare. Here, we demonstrate that common marmoset
monkeys (Callithrix jacchus) do spontaneously provide food to nonreciprocating
and genetically unrelated individuals, indicating that other-regarding
preferences are not unique to humans and that their evolution did not require
advanced cognitive abilities such as theory of mind. Because humans and marmosets
are cooperative breeders and the only two primate taxa in which such unsolicited 
prosociality has been found, we conclude that these prosocial predispositions may
emanate from cooperative breeding.

Preclinical assessment of therapeutic antibodies against human CD40 and human
interleukin-12/23p40 in a nonhuman primate model of multiple sclerosis.

Netherlands. hart@bprc.nl

BACKGROUND: Proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-23, and
costimulatory molecules on antigen-presenting cells (APC), such as CD40, are
critical to autoreactive T cell activation by APC, and hence, are considered
relevant targets of therapy for immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMID).
OBJECTIVE: The current review discusses the preclinical evaluation of two novel
immunotherapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), one directed against human
IL-12/23p40 and the other against CD40. As the antibodies only recognize their
target molecule in primates, the efficacy could not be tested in rodent models.
RESULTS: As a preclinical IMID model for the in vivo evaluation of both mAbs, we 
have used the experimental autoimmune/allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) model in
common marmoset monkeys (Callithrix jacchus). Both mAbs show beneficial
activities in the EAE model when administered early in disease development as
well as after the onset of brain inflammation. The treatment effects were
evaluated using a combination of quantitative magnetic resonance imaging and a
series of ex vivo and immunopathological evaluations.
CONCLUSION: The promising effects during ongoing disease in a relevant
preclinical IMID model illustrate the potential of these two antibodies as
treatment of IMID, in particular for multiple sclerosis on which disease EAE has 
been modeled.

The cotton-top tamarin (Saguinus oedipus) has five beta-microseminoprotein genes,
two of which are pseudogenes.

University, University Hospital MAS, Malmö, Sweden.

beta-Microseminoprotein (MSP) is one of the most abundant proteins in human
seminal plasma and is secreted from the prostate gland. Its evolution can be
traced from primates down to nonvertebrate species such as amphioxus, despite
substantial differences in the primary structure. Most mammals are known to have 
one single MSP gene, but we have previously shown that the cotton-top tamarin and
the common marmoset-two New World monkeys-carry several MSP genes. In this study 
we continue our characterization of MSP genes in the cotton-top tamarin by
presenting the full nucleotide sequence of the three previously identified genes,
mspA, mspE, and mspJ. A promoter analysis using the luciferase reporter showed
that mspE is as transcriptionally active as the single human MSP gene, whereas
mspA and mspJ display no activity with this assay. Two novel MSP genes were also 
identified, mspB and mspH, both of which are pseudogenes. MspB has a frameshift
mutation in the third exon resulting in a new C-terminus and premature stop of
translation. MspH has the features of a processed pseudogene, originating from a 
transcript of mspE. It is integrated into the genome together with another
processed pseudogene originating from a transcript of the nucleoporin gene NUP88.
The MSP genes described in this study probably arose by phylogenetically rather
late duplication or retrotransposition, suggesting that they are confined to a
limited number of New World monkeys.

Dendritic cells (DCs) have important functions as modulators of immune responses,
and their ability to activate T cells is of great value in cancer immunotherapy. 
The isolation of DCs from the peripheral blood of rhesus and African green
monkeys has been reported, but the immune system in the common marmoset remains
poorly characterized, although it offers many potential advantages for
preclinical studies. In the present study, we devised methods, based on
techniques developed for mouse and human DC preparation, for isolating DCs from
three major tissue sources in the common marmoset: bone marrow (BM), spleen and
peripheral blood. Each set of separated cells was analysed using the cell surface
DC-associated markers CD11c, CD80, CD83, CD86 and human leucocyte antigen
(HLA)-DR, all of which are antibodies against human antigens, and the cells were 
further characterized both functionally and morphologically as antigen-presenting
cells. BM proved to be an excellent cell source for the isolation of DCs intended
for preclinical studies on cell therapy, for which large quantities of cells are 
required. In the BM-derived CD11c(+) cell population, cells exhibiting the
characteristic features of DCs were enriched, with the typical DC morphology and 
the abilities to undergo endocytosis, to secrete interleukin (IL)-12, and to
stimulate Xenogenic T cells. Moreover, BM-derived DCs produced the neurotrophic
factor NT-3, which is also found in murine splenic DCs. These results suggest
that BM-derived DCs from the common marmoset may be useful for biological
analysis and for preclinical studies on cell therapy for central nervous system
diseases and cancer.

Characterization and synaptic connectivity of melanopsin-containing ganglion
cells in the primate retina.

Melanopsin is a photopigment expressed in retinal ganglion cells, which are
intrinsically photosensitive and are also involved in retinal circuits arising
from rod and cone photoreceptors. This circuitry, however, is poorly understood. 
Here, we studied the morphology, distribution and synaptic input to
melanopsin-containing ganglion cells in a New World monkey, the common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus). The dendrites of melanopsin-containing cells in marmoset
stratify either close to the inner nuclear layer (outer stratifying), or close to
the ganglion cell layer (inner stratifying). The dendritic fields of
outer-stratifying cells tile the retina, with little overlap. However, the
dendritic fields of outer-stratifying cells largely overlap with the dendritic
fields of inner-stratifying cells. Thus, inner-stratifying and outer-stratifying 
cells may form functionally independent populations. The synaptic input to
melanopsin-containing cells was determined using synaptic markers (antibodies to 
C-terminal binding protein 2, CtBP2, for presumed bipolar synapses, and
antibodies to gephyrin for presumed amacrine synapses). Both outer-stratifying
and inner-stratifying cells show colocalized immunoreactive puncta across their
entire dendritic tree for both markers. The density of CtBP2 puncta on inner
dendrites was about 50% higher than that on outer dendrites. The density of
gephyrin puncta was comparable for outer and inner dendrites but higher than the 
density of CtBP2 puncta. The inner-stratifying cells may receive their input from
a type of diffuse bipolar cell (DB6). Our results are consistent with the idea
that both outer and inner melanopsin cells receive bipolar and amacrine input
across their dendritic tree.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a New World monkey, has recently been
used as a model of focal cerebral ischaemia. Here, we sought to develop a stroke 
model in this species using an intraluminal approach to occlude the middle
cerebral artery (MCA). This technically simple procedure allows both transient
and permanent ischaemia with minimal morbidity. Ten common marmosets underwent
either transient (3 h) or permanent ischaemia by the insertion of a nylon
filament through the external carotid artery up to the origin of the MCA.
Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was monitored by the laser-Doppler flowmetry technique.
Sensorimotor functions were regularly evaluated, and histologic,
immunohistochemical, and magnetic resonance imaging analyses were performed 8
days after the occlusion. The surgical procedure was achieved straightforwardly
without postoperative mortality or cerebral haemorrhage. All animals displayed a 
consistent decrease in CBF that remained stable over 3 h. Infarction affected
both cortical and subcortical structures. Although not statistically significant,
the volume of infarction was smaller in marmosets subjected to transient
ischaemia compared to those permanently occluded (237+/-139 and 358+/-118 mm3,
respectively). In all the behavioural tests used, reperfused marmosets exhibited 
fewer neurologic and functional impairments compared to permanently occluded
ones. We show the feasibility of the induction of permanent or transient focal
cerebral ischaemia in the marmoset using an intraluminal approach with minimal
invasion. This model could be suitable as an advanced screening for potential
stroke therapies in which behavioural, imaging, and histologic analyses can be
compared.

The purpose of this study was to determine the expression and distribution of
band 3 in the collecting duct and connecting tubules of the kidney of the
marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus), and to establish whether band 3 is
expressed in type A intercalated cells. The intracellular localization of band 3 
in the different populations of intercalated cells was determined by
double-labeling immunohistochemistry. Immunohistochemical microscopy demonstrated
that band 3 is located in the basolateral plasma membranes of all type A
intercalated cells in the connecting tubule (CNT), cortical collecting duct
(CCD), and outer medullary collecting duct (OMCD) of the marmoset. However, type 
B intercalated cells and non-A/non-B intercalated cells did not show band 3
labeling. Electron microscopy of the CNT, CCD and OMCD confirmed the light
microscopic observation of the basolateral plasma membrane staining for band 3 in
a subpopulation of interacted cells. Basolateral staining was seen on the plasma 
membrane and small coated vesicles in the perinuclear structure, some of which
were located in the Golgi region. In addition, there was no labeling of band 3 in
the mitochondria of the CNT, CCD and in OMCD cells. The intensity of the
immunostaining of the basolateral membrane was less in the CNT than in the CCD
and OMCD. In contrast, band 3 immunoreactivity was greater in the intracellular
vesicles of the CNT. From these results, we suggest that the basolateral
Cl(-)/HCO(3)(-) exchanger in the monkey kidney is in a more active state in the
collecting duct than in the CNT.

Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection encounters an early block
in the cells of New World monkeys because the CD4 receptor does not efficiently
support HIV-1 entry. We adapted HIV-1(NL4-3) and HIV-1(KB9), two HIV-1 variants
with different envelope glycoproteins, to replicate efficiently in cells
expressing the CD4 and CXCR4 proteins of the common marmoset, a New World monkey.
The HIV-1(NL4-3) adaptation involves three gp120 changes that result in a
specific increase in affinity for the marmoset CD4 glycoprotein. The already high
affinity of the HIV-1(KB9) envelope glycoproteins for marmoset CD4 did not
significantly change as a result of the adaptation. Instead, changes in the gp120
variable loops and gp41 ectodomain resulted in improved replication in cells
expressing the marmoset receptors. HIV-1(KB9) became relatively sensitive to
neutralization by soluble CD4 and antibodies as a result of the adaptation. These
results demonstrate the distinct mechanistic pathways by which the HIV-1 envelope
glycoproteins can adapt to less-than-optimal CD4 molecules and provide HIV-1
variants that can overcome some of the early blocks in New World monkey cells.

The common marmoset serves as a primate model for many human diseases.
Hypogonadal and particularly aged men develop osteopenia or osteoporosis. Whether
marmosets develop osteoporosis after orchidectomy is not known. This was tested
in seven young and two older adult male orchidectomy animals using quantitative
computer tomography, which allowed quantification of total surface and density of
the cortex and of the cancellous structures of the metaphysis of the tibia and of
the fifth or sixth lumbal vertebra (L5/L6) before or after orchidectomy (orx),
and 1, 6 and 12 months later. Surrogate parameters of whole skeletal bone
metabolism (osteocalcin, OC) and C-terminal breakdown products (telopeptides) of 
collagen-alpha1 (CrossLaps) were also measured. Male marmosets lost between 5 and
20% of their initial cancellous density in the metaphysis of the tibia and this
was statistically significant 6 months after castration. No loss of cancellous
density was observed in L5/L6 of young marmosets and OC and the CrossLaps in the 
serum were decreased at this time point while a reduction was observed in bone
mineral density of L5/L6 in two aged animals. It is concluded that castration of 
young male marmoset for 1 year results in a significant loss of bone mineral
density in the metaphysis of the tibia resulting in osteopenia but not in the
vertebra. The results indicate that male orx marmosets become osteopenic within
12 months after castration and may be a more human-like experimental model for
bone research.

Postnatal ontogeny of expression of the corticosteroid receptor genes in
mammalian brains: inter-species and intra-species differences.

Corticosteroids are important mediators of homeostasis and stress, and exert
their effects via two transcription-factor receptors, mineralocorticoid receptor 
(MR) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Both receptors are expressed in the brain 
in a region-specific manner, and regulate neuroendocrine and behavioral
functions. Stress during early development has been demonstrated to lead to
long-term alterations in MR and GR levels and in the phenotypes that they
mediate. To date, however, nearly all of this evidence has been obtained in rats,
and there is actually no clear basis for extrapolation to other species. The
current comparative review presents data, as available, on the following aspects 
of GR and MR gene expression in mouse and rat (Rodentia), tree shrew
(Scandentia), common marmoset, squirrel monkey, rhesus macaque and human
(Primates): (1) species-typical adult expression of MR mRNA and GR mRNA in
hypothalamus, amygdala, hippocampus and neocortex; (2) species-typical neonate,
infant, juvenile/adolescent and adult expression of MR mRNA and GR mRNA in
hippocampus. (1) and (2) allow for identification of inter-species consistencies 
and differences in the relative levels of MR and GR expression across brain
regions and ontogenetic stages. In addition, data are presented on (3)
within-species inter-individual variation in MR and GR expression and causes
thereof, including polymorphism and early life stress. Integrating the evidence
in (1)-(3), it is noted that, should the expression levels of MR and GR at the
time of early-life stress determine the latter's effects on the formers'
long-term expression levels and functioning, then the long-term effects of early 
life stress on corticosteroid receptor expression and function will be species-, 
brain-region- and receptor-type-specific.

In rodents, the expression of a reward-conditioned place preference (CPP) is
regulated in a circadian pattern such that the preference is exhibited strongly
at the circadian time of prior training but not at other circadian times. Because
each animal is trained only at a single circadian phase, the concept of time as a
context cue is derived from a rhythmic internal state rather than learned
explicitly from the external cues. We now report that the same "time memory" is
expressed following context conditioning in the common marmoset (Callithrix
jacchus). Animals were trained at a specific time to discriminate between an
unpaired context and a context paired with food reward. Marmosets were then
tested for preference at circadian times that were either the same or different
from the training time. Preference was expressed only when training and testing
times matched. The results show that time of day learning can be generalized to
this new world primate implying that a similar circadian mechanism might regulate
craving for reward in diverse mammals including human beings.

Chorionic gonadotropin beta-subunit gene expression in the marmoset pituitary is

pituitary homeobox factor 1.

In most mammals, the gonads are under the control of the pituitary gonadotropins 
LH and FSH. However, in the common marmoset monkey Callithrix jacchus, no LH is
detectable in the pituitary but chorionic gonadotropin (CG) instead, normally
produced in the placenta. This study investigated the mechanism of CGbeta subunit
activation in the pituitary and why humans do not express CG in the pituitary.
5'-Rapid amplification of cDNA ends, EMSA, and promoter-driven luciferase assays 
performed with the gonadotropic LbetaT2 cells showed that marmoset monkey CGbeta 
is GnRH responsive and activated similar to human LHbeta by the transcription
factors steroidogenic factor 1 (SF1), early growth response protein 1 (Egr1), and
pituitary homeobox factor 1 (Pitx1) and displayed a transcriptional start site 7 
bp upstream of exon 1. In contrast, the human CGbeta promoter displayed in the
binding elements for pituitary homeobox factor 1 and early growth response
protein 1 three consensus sequence mismatches, leading to very low activity that 
could be drastically increased by mutation to the consensus sequences. Vice
versa, marmoset CGbeta promoter activity was reduced after introduction of the
human CGbeta mismatches. An in vivo study in pregnant marmoset monkeys showed
that during pregnancy, there is no significant decrease of pituitary CG
production, contrasting human LH down-regulation. In conclusion, pituitary CG
production is lacking in humans due to the absence of appropriate DNA-binding
elements, which are present in marmosets, thereby enabling GnRH activation of
expression. However, during pregnancy of marmosets, pituitary CG expression is
not inhibited.

Prion Diseases, IFR70, Neuropathology, Salpêtrière Hospital, Paris 75013, France.

Cellular prion protein (PrP(c)) is a cell surface glycoprotein highly expressed
in neurons, and a protease-resistant conformer of the protein accumulates in the 
brain parenchyma in prion diseases. In human prion diseases, visual cortex and
visual function can be affected. We examined both the levels and the localization
of PrP(c) in developing visual cortex of the common marmoset. Western blot
analysis showed that PrP(c) increased from the day of birth through adulthood,
and this increase correlated with the progression of synapse formation.
Immunohistochemistry showed that PrP(c) was present in fiber tracts of the
neonate, and this immunoreactivity was lost with maturation. Within the neuropil,
the laminar distribution of PrP(c) changed with age. In the neonate, PrP(c)
immunoreactivity was strongest in layer 1, where the earliest synapses form. At
the end of the first postnatal week, layer 4C, as identified by its strong
cytochrome oxidase activity, was noticeably lighter in terms of PrP(c)
immunoreactivity than the adjacent layers. The contrast between the strong
immunoreactivity in both supragranular and infragranular layers and weak
immunoreactivity in layer 4C increased with age. Layers 2/3 and 5 contained more 
intense PrP(c) immunoreactivity; these layers receive thalamic input from the
koniocellular division of the LGN, and these layers of the LGN also had strong
PrP(c) immunoreactivity. Together, these results provide evidence for PrP(c)
localization in an identified functional pathway and may shed some light on prion
disease pathogenesis.

Several physiological properties of owl monkey lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN)
cells were studied to verify whether its nocturnal habit has an influence on the 
organization of its subcortical visual system. Receptive field (RF) dimensions
were measured using drifting gratings and bipartite field stimuli. We found that 
owl monkey cells LGN have larger RFs and were on average more non-linear than
those of diurnal monkeys. But, as in other anthropoids, there is an increase in
RF centre size with increasing eccentricity, and there is a limited correlation
between these centre sizes and retinal ganglion cell dendritic tree sizes. The
influence of contrast on sizes and peak sensitivities of RF centres and surrounds
and on the response phases was studied. Both the sizes and peak sensitivities of 
the RF centres and surrounds decrease as contrast increases. As a result, the
responses to low spatial frequency stimuli saturate with increasing contrast.
Estimates of contrasts at half-maximal responses confirm the presence of
saturation. It was found that the magnocellular cells saturate more strongly than
parvocellular cells. The response phase increases with increasing contrast. These
data resemble those obtained in the common marmoset, indicating that these are
basic features of the primate visual system. We conclude that during evolution
and as an adaptation to a nocturnal lifestyle, cells in the owl monkey LGN
display an increased spatial integration in comparison with diurnal primate
species, without a change in the basic organization common to the primate
subcortical visual system.

From the perspective of comparative morphology, the distribution of
non-monoaminergic neurons in the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) was
investigated using an immunohistochemical method with specific antibodies to
tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and aromatic-L-amino acid decarboxylase
(AADC).TH-immunoreactive (IR) neurons (but not AADC-IR) neurons were observed in 
the olfactory tubercle, preoptic suprachiasmatic nucleus, periventricular
hypothalamic nucleus, arcuate nucleus, paraventricular nucleus, periaqueductal
gray matter, medial longitudinal fasciculus, substantia nigra, and nucleus
solitaris. In contrast, AADC-IR (but not TH-IR), small, oval and spindle-shaped
neurons were sparsely distributed in the following areas: the hypothalamus from
the anterior nucleus to the lateral nucleus, the dorsomedial nucleus, the
dorsomedial area of the medial mammillary nucleus and the arcuate nucleus; the
midbrain, including the stria medullaris and substantia nigra; and the medulla
oblongata, including the dorsal area of the nucleus solitaris and the medullary
reticular nucleus. The distribution of AADC-IR neurons was not as extensive in
the marmoset as it is in rats. However, these neurons were located in the
marmoset, but not the rat substantia nigra. Furthermore, AADC-IR neurons that are
present in the human striatum were absent in that of the marmoset. The present
results indicate that the distribution of non-monoaminergic neurons in the brain 
of the common marmoset is unique and different from that in humans and rodents.

Compatibility of the gH homologues of Epstein-Barr virus and related
lymphocryptoviruses.

Sciences Center, Shreveport, USA.

Glycoprotein gH, together with its chaperone gL and a third glycoprotein gB, is
essential for cell-cell fusion and virus-cell fusion mediated by herpesviruses.
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), the prototype human lymphocryptovirus, requires a
fourth glycoprotein gp42 to support fusion with B cells in addition to epithelial
cells. Two other lymphocryptoviruses, the rhesus lymphocryptovirus (Rh-LCV) and
the common marmoset lymphocryptovirus (CalHV3), have been sequenced in their
entirety and each has a gp42 homologue. Combinations of proteins from EBV, Rh-LCV
and CalHV3 were able to mediate fusion of epithelial cells, but, even when
complexed with EBV gp42, only Rh-LCV and not CalHV3 proteins were able to mediate
fusion with human B cells. CalHV3 gL was also unable to function effectively as a
chaperone for EBV or Rh-LCV gH. The Rh-LCV gH homologue supported more fusion
than EBV gH with an epithelial cell and supported the highest levels of fusion
with a B cell. Chimeric constructs made from Rh-LCV gH and EBV gH that have 85.4 
% sequence identity should prove useful for mapping the regions of gH that are of
importance to fusion as a whole and to B-cell fusion in particular.

Brazil.

Common marmosets, one of the smallest anthropoid primates, have a relatively high
reproductive rate, capable of producing twins or triplets twice per year. Growth 
and development of infants is relatively rapid, and lactation is relatively short
at less than 3 months. Although mean values for the proximate composition (dry
matter, protein, fat and sugar) of captive common marmoset milks fall within
anthropoid norms, composition is highly variable among individual samples, with
concentrations of milk fat ranging from below 1 to over 10%. To examine the
extent to which this variation might be a consequence of captive conditions, we
collected milk samples from wild common marmosets freely living on a farm in the 
state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The proximate composition of the milk samples
was assayed using identical techniques as used for the captive marmoset milks.
The composition of the milk of wild common marmosets was also variable, but
tended to be lower in dry matter, fat, protein and gross energy, and higher in
sugar than milks from captive animals. Interestingly, the percentage of estimated
gross energy from the protein fraction of the milks was relatively constant in
both wild and captive marmosets and did not differ between wild and captive
animals: 1 kcal of common marmoset milk contains on average (+/-SEM) 0.035+/-.001
g of protein regardless of the gross energy content of the milk or whether the
milk was from a wild or captive animal. In contrast, in 1 kcal of low-energy
milks, the amount of sugar was significantly higher and the amount of fat
significantly lower than in 1 kcal of high-energy milks. Thus, common marmoset
milk exhibits axes of variability (especially fat concentration) as well as a
significant stability in the relative amount of protein.

The level of leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (Lrrk2) mRNA expression was measured by
reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction in anterior striatum from normal 
and 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated common marmosets 
(Callithrix jacchus) that had L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine methyl ester
(L-DOPA)-induced dyskinesia. The level of striatal Lrrk2 mRNA was increased in
MPTP-treated common marmosets that had L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia compared with
normal animals that did not receive l-DOPA. Marmosets that exhibited higher
levels of dyskinesia had the greatest increase in striatal Lrrk2 mRNA. Lrrk2 mRNA
expression was also measured in human striatum and substantia nigra from control 
subjects and patients dying with Parkinson's disease. In contrast to marmoset
tissue, no alteration in Lrrk2 mRNA expression was found in parkinsonian human
brain. However, the brain was from patients who had an overall low level of
dyskinesia. The correlation between striatal Lrrk2 mRNA levels in MPTP-treated
common marmoset striatum and L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia indicates that LRRK2 may
have a role in the molecular alterations that cause L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia.

In older humans, bone elongation ceases, periosteal expansion continues, and bone
remodeling remains a dominant metabolic process. An appropriate animal model of
type I and type II osteoporosis would be a species with sealed growth plates and 
persistence of bone remodeling. The rat is commonly used as a primary model, but 
due to delayed epiphyseal closure with continuous modeling and lack of Haversian 
remodeling, Food and Drug Administration guidelines recommend assessment of bone 
quality in an additional, non rodent, remodeling species. This study investigated
the skeletal characteristics of senescent marmosets to evaluate their suitability
as an osteoporosis model. Animals were randomized across three experimental
groups; controls for both sexes and marmosets receiving alendronate for either 30
or 60 days (28 microg/kg, sc, twice per week). Outcome measures included serum
chemistry and bone biomarkers, DEXA, histomorphometry, micro-computed tomography,
and histopathology. Results showed that the adult marmoset skeleton has similar
anatomical characteristics to the adult human, including the absence of growth
plates, presence of Haversian system, and true remodeling of cancellous and
cortical bone. Structural analyses of senescent marmoset cancellous bone
demonstrated loss of trabecular mass and architecture similar to skeletal changes
described for elderly men and women. Treatment with alendronate improved
trabecular volume and number by reducing bone resorption, although bone formation
was also reduced through coupling of bone remodeling. The common marmoset may
provide a valuable model for research paradigms targeting human bone pathology
and osteoporosis due to skeletal features that are similar to age-related changes
and response to bisphosphonate therapy reported for humans.

Callithrix jacchus infants are raised in complex family environments where most
members participate in rearing the young. Many studies examining male parental
behavior have focused on the carrying of infants with observations made within
the family context. However, interference from family members can make it
difficult to assess the father's motivation to care for infants. Our goals were
to develop a testing paradigm for determining an individual's response to infant 
stimuli separate from family influences, compare a male's motivation to respond
to an infant stimulus outside the family with his paternal behavior within the
family, to compare responses to infant stimuli of parentally experienced versus
inexperienced males and finally to develop a reproducible and standardized method
of testing male responsiveness to infant stimulus that could serve to evaluate
hormonal manipulations. Fifteen experienced common marmoset fathers were
evaluated using three different measures of parental behavior: (1) instantaneous 
scan sampling, (2) continuous focal sampling in the family, and (3) continuous
focal sampling of males presented with four infant stimuli: familiar and
unfamiliar infants, familiar and unfamiliar infant vocalizations. Six parentally 
inexperienced males (non-fathers) served as controls. Males that carried the most
in the family were typically the same males that responded most to the infant
vocalization tests. Experienced fathers did not differ in their latency to enter 
the stimulus cage for any of the four infant stimuli response tests while
inexperienced males took significantly longer to enter the stimulus cage. In
addition, fathers expressed a greater frequency of infant-directed behavior than 
did the inexperienced males during the unfamiliar infant and unfamiliar
vocalization tests. These studies show that experienced male marmosets are highly
motivated to interact with infant stimuli and that there is interindividual
variability in response to infant vocalizations. Testing males outside of the
family allows for a clear assessment of male's interest in infant stimuli in both
parentally experienced fathers and inexperienced males.

BACKGROUND: The common marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus), a small
non-endangered New World primate native to eastern Brazil, is becoming
increasingly used as a non-human primate model in biomedical research, drug
development and safety assessment. In contrast to the growing interest for the
marmoset as an animal model, the molecular tools for genetic analysis are
extremely limited.
RESULTS: Here we report the development of the first marmoset-specific
oligonucleotide microarray (EUMAMA) containing probe sets targeting 1541
different marmoset transcripts expressed in hippocampus. These 1541 transcripts
represent a wide variety of different functional gene classes. Hybridisation of
the marmoset microarray with labelled RNA from hippocampus, cortex and a panel of
7 different peripheral tissues resulted in high detection rates of 85% in the
neuronal tissues and on average 70% in the non-neuronal tissues. The expression
profiles of the 2 neuronal tissues, hippocampus and cortex, were highly similar, 
as indicated by a correlation coefficient of 0.96. Several transcripts with a
tissue-specific pattern of expression were identified. Besides the marmoset
microarray we have generated 3215 ESTs derived from marmoset hippocampus, which
have been annotated and submitted to GenBank [GenBank: EF214838-EF215447,
EH380242-EH382846].
CONCLUSION: We have generated the first marmoset-specific DNA microarray and
demonstrated its use to characterise large-scale gene expression profiles of
hippocampus but also of other neuronal and non-neuronal tissues. In addition, we 
have generated a large collection of ESTs of marmoset origin, which are now
available in the public domain. These new tools will facilitate molecular genetic
research into this non-human primate animal model.

The common marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus) is a New World primate that is
increasingly used in biomedical research as a model organism. Due to the
occurrence of natural bone marrow chimerism, it represents a particularly useful 
primate model in immunological research. In this study, we describe the genomic
organization of the CD94, NKG2, and LY49L genes in the NK complex (NKC) of the
common marmoset based on complete sequencing of a bacterial artificial chromosome
clonal contig. This region of the marmoset NKC is 1.5 times smaller than its
human counterpart, but the genes are colinear and orthologous. One exception is
the activating NKG2CE gene, which is probably an ancestral form of the NKG2C- and
NKG2E-activating receptor genes of humans and great apes. The two completely
sequenced marmoset bacterial artificial chromosome clones are derived from
distinct haplotypes, which differ by 200 sites in the overlapping sequence.
Analyses of NKC genes in nine additional marmoset individuals revealed a moderate
degree of polymorphism of the CD94, NKG2A, NKG2CE, and NKG2D genes. Furthermore, 
expression analyses identified several alternatively spliced transcripts,
particularly of the CD94 gene. Several products of alternative splicing of NKC
genes are highly conserved among primates. Alternative transcriptional start
sites were found, but these probably do not lead to a change of the translational
start site or result in longer or shorter cytoplasmic regions of these type II
membrane receptors.

marmoset Callithrix jacchus.

The common marmoset is one of the few callitrichid species that is not threatened
or endangered in the wild, and is widely used in biomedical research, yet
relatively little is understood about its digestive physiology. Dietary
specialization on plant exudates has lead to relatively reduced small intestines,
yet the common marmoset has exceptional dietary breadth, allowing it to
successfully utilize a variety of habitats. We predicted that passive,
paracellular nutrient absorption would be used by the common marmoset to a
greater extent than in other non-flying mammals. We measured the bioavailability 
and rates of absorption of two metabolically inert carbohydrates not transported 
by mediated pathways (L-rhamnose and cellobiose, molecular masses of 164 and 342,
respectively) to measure paracellular uptake, and of a non-metabolized D-glucose 
analog (3-O-methyl-D-glucose) to measure total uptake by both mediated and
paracellular pathways. We found high bioavailability of 3-O-methyl-D-glucose
(83+/-5%), and much higher bioavailability of the paracellular probes than in
similarly sized non-flying mammals (30+/-3% and 19+/-2% for L-rhamnose and
cellobiose, respectively). Passive, paracellular nutrient absorption accounts for
around 30% of total glucose absorption in common marmosets and intestinal
permeability is significantly higher than in humans, the only other species of
primate measured to date. This may allow the common marmoset to maintain high
digestive efficiency when feeding on higher quality foods (fruit, arthropods,
gums with higher proportions of simple sugars), in spite of relatively reduced
small intestines correlated with adaptations for fermentative digestion of plant 
gums. We find no evidence to support, in primates, the hypothesis that reliance
on paracellular nutrient absorption should increase with body size in mammals,
but suggest instead that it may be associated with small body size and/or
taxon-specific adaptations to diet.

The common marmoset as a novel preclinical transplant model: identification of
new MHC class II DRB alleles and prediction of in vitro alloreactivity.

The difficulties with using nonhuman primate species such as rhesus macaques and 
baboons have led us to investigate the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) as an
alternative preclinical model for transplantation research. This requires
reliable methods of detecting alloreactivity between donor and recipient pairs,
particularly if colonies are inbred and share just a few common alleles for
leucocyte antigens. We firstly identified marmoset major histocompatibility
complex (MHC) Class II DRB genes (Caja-DRB*W1201, Caja-DRB1*03, Caja-DRB*W16)
using sequence-based typing techniques. Genomic DNA (n= 49) was extracted from
whole blood or spleen tissue. Exon 2 of target genes was amplified by PCR using
primers specific for known marmoset alleles, and then sequenced using ABI
PRISM((R)) Big Dye Terminator technology and Assign sequence analysis software.
DRB*W1201 was universally present. Eight DRB*W16 alleles and five DRB1*03 alleles
were identified in this colony. We also identified two previously unreported
DRB*W16 alleles, and confirmed inheritance of these alleles within several
sibling groups. Subsequently, we investigated whether matching at MHC Class II
DRB loci alone could predict alloreactivity, as assessed in vitro by two-way
mixed lymphocyte reactions (MLRs). Fully DRB-matched, partially mismatched and
fully mismatched animal pairs were prospectively chosen. MLR was performed using 
mononuclear cells (MNC) isolated from whole blood by density gradient separation.
T-cell proliferation after 5-day culture was measured by (3)H-thymidine
incorporation. Combined MNC from fully mismatched and partially mismatched animal
pairs exhibited significant in vitro T-cell proliferation above single cell
controls (P < 0.01). MNC from fully DRB-matched (but unrelated) animal pairs
exhibited no proliferation compared with controls (P= 0.3). Using DRB genotyping,
suitably alloreactive donor-recipient pairs may therefore be rapidly and
accurately identified for use in further studies of cellular and solid organ
transplantation.

A slowly growing microaerophilic Helicobacter species was isolated from the feces
of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). This bacterium possessed a pair of
nonsheathed bipolar flagella, was positive for oxidase, catalase and alkaline
phosphatase activities, but was negative for gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase and
urease activity and for nitrate reduction. The bacterium was susceptible to
nalidixic acid and resistant to cephalotine and did not hydrolyze hippurate. On
the basis of phenotypic characteristics, 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis and
whole-cell protein profiles, the isolate represents a new species of the genus
Helicobacter, for which the name Helicobacter callitrichis sp. nov. is proposed; 
the type strain of the new species is R-204(T) (GenBank accession number
AY192526).

In vivo hypothalamic gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) release was
characterised for the first time in a New World primate. A nonterminal and
repeatable push-pull perfusion (PPP) technique reliably measured GnRH in
conscious common marmoset monkeys. Nineteen adult females (n = 8 ovary-intact in 
the mid-follicular phase; n = 11 ovariectomised) were fitted with long-term
cranial pedestals, and a push-pull cannula was temporarily placed in unique
locations within the pituitary stalk-median eminence (S-ME) 2 days prior to each 
PPP session. Marmosets underwent 1-3 PPPs (32 PPPs in total) lasting up to 12 h. 
Plasma cortisol levels were not elevated in these habituated marmosets during
PPP, and PPP did not disrupt ovulatory cyclicity or subsequent fertility in
ovary-intact females. GnRH displayed an organised pattern of release, with pulses
occurring every 50.0 +/- 2.6 min and lasting 25.4 +/- 1.3 min. GnRH pulse
frequency was consistent within individual marmosets across multiple PPPs. GnRH
mean concentration, baseline concentration and pulse amplitude varied predictably
with anatomical location of the cannula tip within the S-ME. GnRH release
increased characteristically in response to a norepinephrine infusion and
decreased abruptly during the evening transition to lights off. Ovary-intact
(mid-follicular phase) and ovariectomised marmosets did not differ significantly 
on any parameter of GnRH release. Overall, these results indicate that PPP can be
used to reliably assess in vivo GnRH release in marmosets and will be a useful
tool for future studies of reproductive neuroendocrinology in this small primate.

Lassa virus infection in experimentally infected marmosets: liver pathology and
immunophenotypic alterations in target tissues.

Lassa virus causes thousands of deaths annually in western Africa and is
considered a potential biological weapon. In an attempt to develop a small
nonhuman primate model of Lassa fever, common marmosets were subcutaneously
inoculated with Lassa virus strain Josiah. This inoculation resulted in a
systemic disease with clinical and morphological features mirroring those in
fatal human Lassa infection: fever, weight loss, high viremia and viral RNA load 
in tissues, elevated liver enzymes, and severe morbidity between days 15 and 20. 
The most prominent histopathology findings included multifocal hepatic necrosis
with mild inflammation and hepatocyte proliferation, lymphoid depletion, and
interstitial nephritis. Cellular aggregates in regions of hepatocellular necrosis
were largely composed of HAM56-positive macrophages, devoid of CD3-positive and
CD20-positive cells, and characterized by marked reductions in the intensity of
HLA-DP, DQ, DR staining. A marked reduction in the major histocompatibility
complex class II expression was also observed in the lymph nodes.
Immunophenotypic alterations in spleen included reductions in overall numbers of 
CD20-positive and CD3-positive cells and the disruption of lymphoid follicular
architecture. These findings identify the common marmoset as an appropriate model
of human Lassa fever and present the first experimental evidence that replication
of Lassa virus in tissues is associated with alterations that would be expected
to impair adaptive immunity.

OFF midget bipolar cells in the retina of the marmoset, Callithrix jacchus,
express AMPA receptors.

Recent studies suggested that different types of OFF bipolar cells express
specific types of ionotropic (AMPA or kainate) glutamate receptors (GluRs) at
their contacts with cone pedicles. However, the question of which GluR type is
expressed by which type of OFF bipolar cell in primate retina is still open. In
this study, the expression of AMPA and kainate receptor subunits at the dendritic
tips of flat (OFF) midget bipolar (FMB) cells was analyzed in the retina of the
common marmoset, Callithrix jacchus. We used preembedding electron microscopy and
double immunofluorescence with subunit-specific antibodies. The FMB cells were
labeled with antibodies against the carbohydrate epitope CD15. Cone pedicles were
identified with peanut agglutinin. Immunoreactivity for the GluR1 subunit and for
CD15 is preferentially located at triad-associated flat contacts. Furthermore,
the large majority of GluR1 immunoreactive puncta is localized at the dendritic
tips of FMB cells. These results suggest that FMB cells express the AMPA receptor
subunit GluR1. In contrast, the kainate receptor subunit GluR5 is not colocalized
with the dendritic tips of FMB cells or with the GluR1 subunit. Immunoreactive
puncta for the GluR1 subunit are found at all M/L-cone pedicles but are only
rarely associated with S-cone pedicles. This is consistent with our recent
findings in marmoset retina that FMB cells do not contact S-cone pedicles. The
presence of GluR5 clusters at S-cone pedicles indicates that in primate retinas
OFF bipolar cells expressing kainate receptor subunits receive some S-cone input.

Experimental animal studies and epidemiological and clinical human studies
demonstrate that atypical infant-caregiving can exert short- and long-term
effects on offspring phenotype, including increased long-term risk of affective
disorders. Whilst the early environment is therefore a major determinant of
behavioral, physiological and neurobiological phenotypes, the effects of early
adversity exhibit individual variation, presumably due to differences in
environment-genotype interactions. Twin studies provide a powerful model with
which to study such interactions. However, human twin studies rarely include
analysis of genotype-environment interactions or of individuals exposed to
extreme environments, and rat studies have rarely attempted to utilize
littermates (i.e. dizygotic twins) to investigate environment-genotype
interactions. Here, we report on the effects of repeated deprivation of
caregiving in the common marmoset, a primate that exhibits dizygotic twinning and
bi-parental care. Breeding pairs each contributed early deprived (ED) twins and
control (CON) twins, thereby allowing for the study of effects of ED, parentage
and ED-parentage interaction. Significant ED x parentage interaction effects were
obtained for basal urinary, plasma and cerebrospinal-fluid cortisol titers
(infancy-adolescence), and basal levels of social and maintenance behaviors
(juveniles); basal urinary cortisol titers during a 2-week period of repeated
psychosocial challenge (juveniles), and social and exploratory behavior during
psychosocial challenge (juveniles). Significant main effects of ED were obtained 
for: basal levels of time spent in contact with parents (ED>CON; juveniles) and
in locomotor activity (ED<CON; adolescents); basal and
psychosocial-stress-related systolic blood pressure (ED>CON; juveniles); time
spent in locomotor activity (ED<CON), contact calling (ED<CON) and exploring
novelty (ED>CON) during psychosocial challenge (juveniles). This study provides
evidence for long-term effects of early environment on bio-behavioral traits and 
states in marmosets specifically, and the importance of including parental
factors in developmental studies in mammals generally.

OBJECTIVES: To reevaluate pathologically and biochemically 30 autopsy cases
related to Minamata disease (MD) in Niigata Prefecture (NP) and compare the
findings with those of autopsy cases related to MD in Kumamoto Prefecture (KP).
METHODS: Recently, a set of pathological materials of these 30 autopsy cases has 
been sent from the Brain Research Institute at the University of Niigata to the
National Institute for Minamata Disease (NIMD). The materials from each autopsy
case were reexamined at the NIMD.
RESULTS: There were no postnatal and fetal cases of MD in the NP autopsy
materials. The contents of total mercury (T-Hg), methylmercury (Me-Hg), inorganic
mercury (I-Hg) and selenium were measured in the organs of cerebrum, cerebellum, 
liver and kidney. The contents of T-Hg, Me-Hg and I-Hg were much higher in two
cases than in controls. The pathological findings leading to the diagnosis of MD 
in the NP cases were essentially the same as those in KP, including the
peripheral nerve lesions. In the most severely affected case of MD in NP,
formation of multiple vacuoles of various sizes was observed in the cerebellar
cortex, which was never encountered in the KP cases. The KP lesions were similar 
to that observed in an acute case of Me-Hg-treated common marmoset studied in the
NIMD.
CONCLUSION: The pathological features were essentially the same between the adult
cases of MD in NP and KP.

Non-invasive measurement of small peptides in the common marmoset (Callithrix

A non-invasive assay for measurement of oxytocin (OT) and vasopressin (AVP) in
primates would enable researchers to study the relationship between the endocrine
system and behavior without disturbing potentially endangered animals in their
natural habitats. In order to test whether or not OT specifically would be
measurable in the urine of a primate, 10 microCi of tritium-labeled OT were
injected into the peripheral blood supply of four adult male common marmosets
(Callithrix jacchus), with continuous urinary collection over 48 h. When urine
was processed by HPLC separation and beta counting for radioactive clearance, the
label was present in all samples in the fraction where OT elutes. Large amounts
of OT were also seen in a fraction other than that containing the OT standard,
indicating that OT is measurable but that it also undergoes substantial metabolic
breakdown. In a second experiment, we isolated six common marmosets for 48 h and 
then exposed them to social contact to evaluate the effect of changing social
stimuli on endogenous urinary measurement of both OT and AVP. Both were measured 
after HPLC separation to isolate the intact molecule and also to control for
cross-reactivity with metabolites in subsequent RIA. Cortisol was also measured
to objectively evaluate the stress response. A priori assumptions were that
urinary OT and AVP would be lower during a period of isolation and higher during 
periods of social contact. These assumptions were met, leading us to conclude
that peripheral OT and AVP are measurable via urinary assay and that such an
assay is a valid means of evaluating social condition in this species.

Effects of prenatal dexamethasone treatment on postnatal physical, endocrine, and
social development in the common marmoset monkey.

The prophylactic treatment of diagnosed preterm delivery with synthetic
glucocorticoids, such as dexamethasone (DEX), is commonplace. Long-term effects
of such treatment are not well understood. In the present study, we exposed
pregnant common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus), small-bodied monkeys that are
therefore advantageous for long-term primate studies, to daily repeated DEX (5
mg/kg orally) either during early (d 42-48) or late (d 90-96) pregnancy
(gestation period of 144 d). Relative to control, we investigated DEX effects in 
terms of maternal endocrinology (plasma cortisol and estrogen titers) and
offspring physical growth, plasma and urinary ACTH and cortisol titers, and
social and maintenance behaviors from birth to weaning. Both DEX treatments
resulted in markedly reduced maternal plasma cortisol titers during treatment and
reduced estimated gestation period. Both treatments were without effects on
neonate morphometric measurements and basal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis
activity. Early DEX treatment resulted in increased infant body weight at
postnatal d 56 and 84, co-occurring at the behavioral level with increased time
spent in eating solid food, a mobile state, solitary play, and exhibiting tail
hair piloerection. The constellation of physical and behavioral effects of early 
DEX suggests interesting parallels with the human metabolic syndrome, providing
primate support that the latter is causally associated with the fetal
environment, including prenatal programming. This novel primate in vivo evidence 
for postnatal effects of prenatal synthetic glucocorticoid exposure indicates the
importance of improved understanding of this acute clinical treatment in terms of
its long-term effects on offspring well-being.

The semen coagulum proteins have undergone substantial structural changes during 
evolution. In primates, these seminal vesicle-secreted proteins are known as
semenogelin I (SEMG1) and semenogelin II (SEMG2). Previous studies on the common 
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) showed that ejaculated semen from this New World
monkey contains semenogelin, but it remained unclear whether it carries both
genes or only SEMG1 and no SEMG2, like the closely related cotton-top tamarin
(Saguinus oedipus). In this study we show that there are two genes, both
expressed in the seminal vesicles. Surprisingly, the genes show an almost perfect
sequence identity in a region of 1.25 kb, encompassing nearly half of the genes
and containing exon 1, intron 1, and the first 0.9 kb of exon 2. The underlying
molecular mechanism is most likely gene conversion, and a phylogenetic analysis
suggests that SEMG1 is the most probable donor gene. The marmoset SEMG1 in this
report differs from a previously reported cDNA by a lack of nucleotides encoding 
one repeat of 60 amino acids, suggesting that marmoset SEMG1 displays allelic
size variation. This is similar to what was recently demonstrated in humans, but 
in marmosets the polymorphism was generated by a repeat duplication, whereas in
humans it was a deletion. Together, these studies shed new light on the evolution
of semenogelins and the mechanisms that have generated the structural diversity
of semen coagulum proteins.

Following active service during the 1990/1991 Gulf Conflict, a number of UK and
US veterans presented with a diverse range of symptoms, collectively known as
Gulf Veterans Illnesses (GVI). The administration of vaccines and/or the
pretreatment against possible nerve agent poisoning, pyridostigmine bromide (PB),
given to Armed Forces personnel during the Gulf Conflict has been implicated as a
possible factor in the aetiology of these illnesses. The possibility that adverse
health effects may result from the administration of these vaccines (anthrax,
pertussis, plague, yellow fever, polio, typhoid, tetanus, hepatitis B,
meningococcal meningitis and cholera) and/or PB, have been investigated over an
eighteen month period, in a non-human primate model, the common marmoset. This
study reports immunological indices, including leukocyte phenotypes,
intracellular cytokines IFN-gamma and IL-4 and antibody responses against vaccine
antigens. Using human isotyping reagents previously shown to cross react with
marmoset immunoglobulins (ibid) it was shown that marmosets responded strongly
against anthrax PA and pertussis and weakly against killed whole cell plague,
cholera and typhoid. At the end of the study the immune response to a previously 
unseen T-cell dependent antigen, keyhole limpet haemocyanin (KLH), was examined
in order to determine whether immune function had been compromised by the
compounds administered. Statistically equivalent, robust antibody responses were 
measured against KLH in all treatment groups indicating that the immune system
had not been compromised by any of the treatments. In addition, urinary cortisol 
was measured at key points throughout the study as an index of physiological
stress which may have been induced by the treatments. There were no effects of
treatment on urinary cortisol secretion. With respect to the other immunological 
indices measured, there were no statistical differences between the treatment
groups during the period of the study.

This methodological study was carried out in preparation for a major long term
study, also reported in this volume, which was designed to investigate whether
the combination of vaccines and pyridostigmine bromide (PB) could have been
responsible for adverse signs and symptoms reported by a number of veterans of
the 1990/1991 Gulf conflict. In this context, the marmoset has been used to model
aspects of the human immune system. The purposes of this methodological study
were to select appropriate immunochemical reagents to measure humoral responses
induced in marmosets in response to selected health and hygiene and biological
warfare vaccines and to initially assess the effects of PB on the responses
recorded. Vaccines were administered at 1/5th of a human dose, and also
investigated in combination with the nerve agent pretreatment compound PB. PB
dosing was selected to induce an inhibition of erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase
by 30%. In order to assess the functionality of the immune system, antibody
responses to a neo-antigen (keyhole limpet haemocyanin--KLH), administered some 2
months following the completion of the vaccination schedule, were measured. The
present study identified appropriate isotyping reporter reagents which
cross-reacted with equivalent marmoset immunoglobulins. Robust antibody responses
were identified against anthrax protective antigen (PA), whole cell pertussis
vaccine and KLH, while weaker responses were measured against cholera and typhoid
vaccines. The killed whole cell plague vaccine induced a response which was at
the limit of detection of the assay. Coadministered PB had no discernable effect 
on immunological responses in this study.

Transitory uptake of serotonin in the developing sensory pathways of the common
marmoset.

la Salpêtrière, Paris, France.

Serotonin (5-HT) affects brain development during sensitive developmental
periods. In rodents, transient sites of high affinity capture of 5-HT were
demonstrated in the primary sensory neurons and in the sensory thalamocortical
afferents. This uptake is required to adjust 5-HT receptor stimulation during the
formation of sensory maps. To determine whether similar mechanisms exist in
primates, we analyzed staged embryos and postnatal pups in the common marmoset
(total gestation time, 142 days). Immunocytochemical analyses were performed
using antisera to 5-HT, to the serotonin transporter (SERT), and to the vesicular
monoamine transporter (VMAT2). 5-HT, SERT, and VMAT2 labeled the raphe neurons
and their terminal network from embryonic day (E)70 to adulthood. In addition,
from E70-130 VMAT2 and SERT were observed in all the sensory cranial nerves, the 
olfactory nerve, the gustatory, the trigeminal, the auditory fibers, in the
retinal ganglion cells, and the optic tract up to the lateral geniculate nucleus 
and the superior colliculus. All the spinal sensory ganglia and their peripheral 
sensory branches were labeled. Accumulation of 5-HT was observed in all the
sensory neurons expressing SERT and the corresponding axon tracts. Since these
neurons were missing tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH), the synthesizing enzyme for
5-HT, they most likely accumulated 5-HT through the action of the amine
transporters, as has been shown in rodents. No transient expression of 5-HT
markers was detectable in the sensory thalamocortical axons at any of the ages
examined. Thus, the existence of 5-HT uptake in nonserotoninergic neurons appears
to be a conserved feature in primates, although the topographic extent of this
transient expression is more restricted than that previously demonstrated in
rodents.

Head-cocking as a form of exploration in the common marmoset and its development.

Head-cocking of 15 infant marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) was scored from Day 1 to
60 of postnatal life, the growth period with overproduction of interneuronal
synapses. Head-cocking was scored during four 30 min intervals daily, including
angle of head-cocking and objects being fixated. Mean age of onset of
head-cocking was Day 13 (+/-1.3) and frequency increased to a fixed rate by Day
24-29, at the time of maturation of the foveal representation in layer 6 of the
visual cortex, thus lending further support to the importance of head-cocking to 
visual processing. The most common distance of objects fixated during
head-cocking was up to .5 m. Angle of head-cocking increased with age, and some
asymmetry of direction was noted. Fewer head-cocking events occurred in the
morning than in the afternoon. We also scored anogenital licking of offspring.
Head-cocking occurred at higher levels in marmosets receiving more anogenital
licking. As this was associated positively with increased exploration,
head-cocking may be regarded as an exploratory behavior.

Acoustic analysis of vocal development in a New World primate, the common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).

In contrast to humans and songbirds, there is limited evidence of vocal learning 
in nonhuman primates. While previous studies suggested that primate vocalizations
exhibit developmental changes, detailed analyses of the extent and time course of
such changes across a species' vocal repertoire remain limited. In a highly vocal
primate, the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), we studied developmental
changes in the acoustic structure of species-specific communication sounds
produced in a social setting. We performed detailed acoustic analyses of the
spectral and temporal characteristics of marmoset vocalizations during
development, comparing differences between genders and twin pairs, as well as
with vocalizations from adult marmosets residing in the same colony. Our analyses
revealed significant changes in spectral and temporal features as well as
variability of particular call types over time. Infant and juvenile vocalizations
changed progressively toward the vocalizations produced by adult marmosets. Call 
types observed early in development that were unique to infants disappeared
gradually with age, while vocal exchanges with conspecifics emerged. Our
observations clearly indicate that marmoset vocalizations undergo both
qualitative and quantitative postnatal changes, establishing the basis for
further studies to delineate contributions from maturation of the vocal apparatus
and behavioral experience.

Protein-structure-based prediction of animal model suitability for
pharmacodynamic studies of subtype-selective estrogens.

Subtype-selective estrogens are of increasing importance as tools used to unravel
physiological roles of the estrogen receptors, ERalpha and ERbeta, in various
species. Although human ERalpha and ERbeta differ by only two amino acids within 
the binding pockets, we and others recently succeeded in generating
subtype-selective agonists. We have proposed that the selectivity of the
steroidal compounds 16alpha-lactone-estradiol (16alpha-LE(2), hERalpha selective)
and 8beta-vinyl-estradiol (8beta-VE(2), hERbeta selective) is based on the
interaction of certain substituents of these compounds with essentially one amino
acid in the respective ER binding pockets. For in vitro and ex vivo
pharmacological experiments with these compounds we intended to use bovine
tissues available from slaughterhouses in larger quantities. Using homology
modeling techniques we determined that the amino acid conferring high
hERbeta-selectivity to 8beta-VE(2) is not exchanged between human and bovine
ERalpha and bovine ERbeta. Thus, we predicted our steroidal hERbeta-selective
compound to exhibit only weak agonistic activity at bERbeta and that bovine
tissue is therefore not suited for investigation of ERbeta functions. The
situation is presumably identical for pig, sheep, and the common marmoset,
whereas rats, mice, and rhesus macaques are appropriate animal models to study
pharmacological effects of 8beta-VE(2) in vivo. This prediction was confirmed in 
transactivation studies assessing estradiol (E(2)) and the two subtype-selective 
ligands on bovine ERbeta and on a series of hERalpha and hERbeta with mutations
in their respective ligand-binding pockets. We have shown that the detailed
understanding of the interactions of a compound with its target protein enables
the identification of relevant species for pharmacological studies.

The spontaneous incidence and distribution of beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide and
argyrophilic deposits were extensively investigated in the common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus). In 12 young marmosets, up to 67 coronal step sections were 
evaluated in the brain. One brain hemisphere was stained by a silver method and
also immunohistochemically with a primary antibody directed against Abeta.
Argyrophilic deposits were observed in 4 (33%) of 12 animals with silver stain,
and Abeta was seen in 4 (33%) of 12 animals with anti-4G8 antibody. The overall
incidence was 6 (50%) of 12 affected animals. These results show that the young
marmoset brain displays Abeta deposits at a low incidence and that
immunohistochemistry is more suitable than silver staining to reveal rare amyloid
plaques. These findings also provide evidence for the early onset of amyloid
deposits in marmoset brain.

Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) induced with recombinant human
myelin/oligodendrocyte glycoprotein in the common marmoset is a useful
preclinical model of multiple sclerosis in which white matter lesions can be well
visualized with MRI. In this study we characterized lesion progression with
quantitative in vivo MRI (4.7 T; T(1) relaxation time +/- Gd-DTPA; T(2)
relaxation time; magnetization transfer ratio, MTR, imaging) and correlated end
stage MRI presentation with quantitative ex vivo MRI (formaldehyde fixed brains; 
T(1) and T(2) relaxation times; MTR) and histology. The histopathological
characterization included axonal density measurements and the numeric
quantification of infiltrated macrophages expressing markers for early active
[luxol fast blue (LFB) or migration inhibition factor-related protein-14
positive] or late active/inactive [periodic acid Schiff (PAS) positive]
demyelinating lesion. MRI experiments were done every two weeks until the monkeys
were sacrificed with severe EAE-related motor deficits. Compared with the normal 
appearing white matter, lesions showed an initial increase in T(1) relaxation
times, leakage of Gd-DTPA and decrease in MTR values. The progressive enlargement
of lesions was associated with stabilized T(1) values, while T(2) initially
increased and stabilized thereafter and MTR remained decreased. Gd-DTPA leakage
was highly variable throughout the experiment. MRI characteristics of the cortex 
and (normal appearing) white matter did not change during the experiment. We
observed that in vivo MTR values correlated positively with the number of early
active (LFB+) and negatively with late active (PAS+) macrophages. Ex vivo MTR and
relaxation times correlated positively with the number of PAS-positive
macrophages. None of the investigated MRI parameters correlated with axonal
density.

Perception of the stereokinetic illusion by the common marmoset (Callithrix

Stereokinetic illusions have never been investigated in non-human primates, nor
in other mammalian species. These illusions consist in the perception of a 3D
solid object when certain 2D stimuli are rotated slowly in the plane
perpendicular to the line of sight. The ability to perceive the stereokinetic
illusion was investigated in the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). Four adult
marmosets were trained to discriminate between a solid cylinder and a solid cone 
for food reward. Once learning criterion was reached, the marmosets were tested
in sets of eight probe trials in which the two solid objects used at training
were replaced by two rotating 2D stimuli. Only one of these stimuli produced, at 
least to the human observer, the stereokinetic illusion corresponding to the
solid object previously reinforced. At test, the general behaviour and the total 
time spent by the marmosets observing each stimulus were recorded. The subjects
stayed longer near the stimulus producing the stereokinetic illusion
corresponding to the solid object reinforced at training than they did near the
illusion corresponding to the previously non-rewarded stimulus. Hence, the common

primates.

BACKGROUND: Killer Immunoglobulin-like Receptors (KIR) are essential
immuno-surveillance molecules. They are expressed on natural killer and T cells, 
and interact with human leukocyte antigens. KIR genes are highly polymorphic and 
contribute vital variability to our immune system. Numerous KIR genes, belonging 
to five distinct lineages, have been identified in all primates examined thus far
and shown to be rapidly evolving. Since few KIR remain orthologous between
species, with only one of them, KIR2DL4, shown to be common to human, apes and
monkeys, the evolution of the KIR gene family in primates remains unclear.
RESULTS: Using comparative analyses, we have identified the ancestral KIR lineage
(provisionally named KIR3DL0) in primates. We show KIR3DL0 to be highly conserved
with the identification of orthologues in human (Homo sapiens), common chimpanzee
(Pan troglodytes), gorilla (Gorilla gorilla), rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta) and 
common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). We predict KIR3DL0 to encode a functional
molecule in all primates by demonstrating expression in human, chimpanzee and
rhesus monkey. Using the rhesus monkey as a model, we further show the expression
profile to be typical of KIR by quantitative measurement of KIR3DL0 from an
enriched population of natural killer cells.
CONCLUSION: One reason why KIR3DL0 may have escaped discovery for so long is
that, in human, it maps in between two related leukocyte immunoglobulin-like
receptor clusters outside the known KIR gene cluster on Chromosome 19. Based on
genomic, cDNA, expression and phylogenetic data, we report a novel lineage of
immunoglobulin receptors belonging to the KIR family, which is highly conserved
throughout 50 million years of primate evolution.

Intrauterine exposure to dexamethasone impairs proliferation but not neuronal
differentiation in the dentate gyrus of newborn common marmoset monkeys.

Glucocorticoids applied prenatally alter birth weight and the maturation of the
lungs. Moreover, glucocorticoids impair neuronal proliferation and
differentiation in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. In the present study
proliferation and neuronal differentiation in the dentate gyrus were studied in
newborn common marmoset monkeys which were intrauterinely exposed to the
synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone (DEX). Pregnant marmoset monkeys received 
DEX (5 mg/kg body weight) daily either during early (days 42-48) or late (days
90-96) pregnancy. In the hippocampi of newborn monkeys immunohistochemistry was
performed with markers of proliferation (Ki-67), apoptosis (in situ tailing) as
well as early and late neuronal differentiation (calretinin and calbindin). Both 
after early and late intrauterine exposure to DEX, proliferation of dentate gyrus
cells was significantly decreased (P < 0.05). The density of apoptotic neurons
was not altered by DEX treatment. Quantification of calretinin- and
calbindin-immunoreactive neurons showed no significant differences between
DEX-exposed and control animals. In conclusion, the proliferation of putative
precursor cells but not the differentiation into mature cells was impaired in the
dentate gyrus of newborn marmosets exposed intrauterinely to DEX.

Pathomorphological studies described pathological heterogeneity in patients with 
multiple sclerosis (MS). Different effector mechanisms might therefore be
responsible for lesion formation in MS. The present report shows that myelin
oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-induced experimental autoimmune
encephalomyelitis (EAE) in common marmoset monkeys reflects one specific lesional
subtype of MS, namely MS pattern II lesions with antibody/complement-mediated
damage. MOG-induced EAE in marmoset monkeys will, therefore, provide an ideal
model for therapeutic approaches directed against B-cell/antibody/complement in
MS.

MHC Class II DRB genotyping is highly predictive of in-vitro alloreactivity in
the common marmoset.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is emerging as a promising alternative
pre-clinical model for transplantation and immunological research. It is
therefore important to establish a rapid and reliable method of confirming
alloreactivity between donor-recipient pairs. In this study of a large marmoset
colony (n=49), we firstly characterised MHC Class II genes (Caja-DRB*W1201,
Caja-DRB1*03, Caja-DRB*W16) using, for the first time in this species,
sequence-based allelic typing techniques. Exon 2 was amplified using M13-tailed
PCR primers specific for known marmoset alleles, and sequenced using universal
M13 sequencing primers and dye terminator cycle sequencing. Twenty-six genotypes 
involving monomorphic Caja-DRB*W1201, 8 Caja-DRB*W16 and 5 Caja-DRB1*03 alleles
were observed. Two new DRB*W16 alleles were identified. Subsequently we
investigated whether matching at MHC-DRB loci alone could accurately predict
in-vitro alloreactivity as assessed by mixed lymphocyte reactions. Peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) isolated from fully and partially DRB-matched and 
fully mismatched animal pairs were mixed and co-cultured for T-cell
proliferation. PBMC co-cultured from fully or partially mismatched pairs
exhibited significant T cell proliferation above single cell controls (p<0.01).
Mixed PBMC from fully DRB-matched pairs exhibited no proliferation over controls 
(p=0.3). Thus using Caja-DRB genotyping, suitably alloreactive donor-recipient
pairs can be rapidly and accurately identified for use in further studies of
cellular and solid organ transplantation.

Following active service during the 1990/1991 Gulf conflict, a number of UK and
US veterans presented with a diverse range of symptoms, collectively known as
Gulf Veterans' Illnesses (GVI). The administration of vaccines and/or the
pretreatment against possible nerve agent poisoning, pyridostigmine bromide (PB),
given to Armed Forces personnel during the Gulf conflict has been implicated as a
possible factor in the aetiology of these illnesses. The possibility that
long-term health effects may result from the administration of these vaccines
(anthrax, pertussis, plague, yellow fever, polio, typhoid, tetanus, hepatitis B, 
meningococcal meningitis and cholera) and/or PB, have been investigated using a
non-human primate model, the common marmoset. This paper reports the results from
two aspects of the study, brain electrical activity (EEG, collected during
performance of a touchscreen mediated discrimination task) and sleep. There were 
no marked long-term changes in EEG or sleep patterns that could be attributed to 
vaccines and/or PB administration. The changes that were detected were
predominantly time related and independent of treatment. Where statistical
differences were detected between treatments, the magnitudes of the difference
were relatively minor and therefore not regarded as having long term biological
significance.

Cerebellar localization of the NO-receptive soluble guanylyl cyclase
subunits-alpha(2)/beta (1) in non-human primates.

Nitric-oxide-sensitive guanylyl cyclase (NO-sGC) plays a pivotal role in many
second messenger cascades. Neurotransmission- and neuropathology-related changes 
in NO-sGC have been suggested. However, the cellular localization of NO-sGC in
primate brains, including humans, remains unknown. Biochemical evidence has
linked the alpha(2)-subunit of NO-sGC directly to neurotransmission in rodents.
Here, we have used a recently characterized subunit-specific antibody for the
localization of the alpha(2)-subunit on sections from the cerebelli of the common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus; New World monkey) and macaque monkeys (Macaca
mulatta, M. fascicularis; Old World monkeys). In contrast to the more ubiquitous 
cytoplasmic presence of subunit-beta(1), the alpha(2)-subunit is mainly confined 
to the somato-dendritic membrane including the spines of the Purkinje cells. Only
limited colocalization with presynaptically localized synaptophysin has been seen
under our staining conditions, indicating a higher abundance of subunit-alpha(2) 
at the postsynaptic site. This localization indicates that subunit-alpha(2) links
NO-sGC to neurotransmission, whereas subunit-beta(1) may act as a cytoplasmic
regulator/activator by contributing to active heterodimer formation via
translocation from the cytoplasm to the cell membrane. The last-mentioned action 
may be a prerequisite for generating nitric-oxide-dependent, subcellular, and
postsynaptically localized cGMP signals along neuronal processes.

Paternal behaviour is critical for the survival of offspring in many monogamous
species. Common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) and cotton-top tamarin (Saguinus
oedipus) fathers spend as much or more time caring for infants than mothers.
Expectant males of both species showed significant increases in weight across the
pregnancy whereas control males did not (five consecutive months for marmoset
males and six months for cotton-top tamarin males). Expectant fathers might be
preparing for the energetic cost of fatherhood by gaining weight during their
mate's pregnancy.

Differential macrophage/microglia activation in neocortical EAE lesions in the
marmoset monkey.

Recent studies revealed an important involvement of the cerebral cortex in
multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. Cortical lesions in MS were reported to be less
inflammatory and to show less structural damage than white matter lesions. Animal
models reflecting the histopathological hallmarks of cortical demyelinated
lesions in MS are sparse. Induction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis 
(EAE) in the common marmoset has turned out to be an attractive non-human-primate
model for MS. In the present study we investigated the presence and detailed
cellular composition of cortical inflammatory demyelinating pathology in the
common marmoset upon immunization with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG).
Extensive cortical demyelination reflecting the topographically distinct cortical
lesion types in MS patients was revealed by immunohistochemistry for myelin basic
protein (MBP). We explored the density of T- and B-lymphocytes, MHC-II expressing
macrophages/microglia cells and early activated macrophages (MRP14) at
perivascular and parenchymal lesions sites in neocortex and subcortical white
matter. Despite a similar density of perivascular inflammatory infiltrates in the
demyelinated neocortex, a considerable lower fraction of macrophages was found to
express MRP14 in the neocortex indicating a different activation pattern in
cortical compared with white matter lesions. Furthermore, cortical EAE lesions in
marmoset monkeys revealed immunoglobulin leakage and complement component C9
deposition in intracortical but not subpial demyelination. Our findings indicate 
that the inflammatory response, especially macrophage and microglia activation,
may be regulated differently in gray matter areas in primate brain.

Marmoset glutathione peroxidases: cDNA sequences, molecular evolution, and gene
expression.

Author information:

BACKGROUND: Dysfunction of the cellular antioxidant system and accumulation of
reactive oxygen species are involved in the pathophysiology of diseases such as
cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative disorders, tumors, male infertility and
aging. Two gluthathione peroxidases play key roles in the cellular protection
against oxidative damage. Glutathione peroxidase (GPx-1) removes cytosolic
hydroperoxides while phospholipid-hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (GPx-4) is
a unique enzyme that reduces phospholipid peroxides in membranes.
METHODS: We cloned and sequenced the full-length cDNA for GPx-1 (GenBank:
AY966403) and GPx-4 (GenBank: AY966404) from the common marmoset (Callithrix
jacchus) in order to create a suitable model for studying human diseases related 
with oxidative stress.
RESULTS: The cDNAs encode a 202 amino acid protein for GPx-1 and a 197 amino acid
protein for GPx-4. Both proteins include selenocysteine (Sec, in Gpx-1 at
position 48; in GPx-4 at position 73) and showed high homology (>90%) with other 
mammalian GPxs. The relative levels of mRNA expression for GPx-1 and GPx-4 were
determined in different marmoset tissues by quantitative real-time reverse
transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction using transcription elongation factor-2
as a reference gene. GPx-1 showed increased levels of expression in the liver,
heart and kidney while the highest mRNA levels for GPx-4 were detected in the
testis, followed by the liver, lung, kidney and spinal cord.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings will be of value for studies designed to assess the
role of glutathione peroxidases in non-human primate models for a variety of
diseases in which increased oxidative stress has been implicated.

It has been supposed that central nervous neurons do not express MHC class I
molecules. However, recent studies clearly demonstrated functional MHC class I
expression in the rodent brain. In the present study, we have extended these
studies and investigated the presence of MHC class I transcripts and proteins in 
the brain of a non-human primate species, the common marmoset monkey (Callithrix 
jacchus). Using in-situ hybridization, we found strong expression of MHC class I 
transcripts in neocortex, hippocampal formation, substantia nigra and nucleus
ruber. In-situ hybridization with emulsion autoradiography demonstrated MHC class
I mRNA in distinct pyramidal neurons of cortex and hippocampus, in granule
neurons of the dentate gyrus, in dopaminergic neurons of substantia nigra and in 
motor neurons of nucleus ruber. Immunocytochemistry confirmed MHC class I protein
expression in these neurons. Two monoclonal antibodies, MRC-Ox18 and HB115,
reacted differentially with MHC class I proteins on neuronal and non-neuronal
cells, respectively. Interestingly, in marmoset monkeys that were
immunosuppressed with FK506 (tacrolimus), expression of neuronal MHC class I
proteins, which could be detected with MRC-Ox18, was either very low (neocortex, 
nucleus ruber, substantia nigra) or absent (hippocampus). In contrast, class I
expression in endothelial cells, which was detected by HB115, was not affected by
immunosuppression. Our data show that selected neurons in the brain of a
non-human primate express MHC class I molecules and that this expression can be
modulated by immunosuppression.

The development of embryonic stem cell (ESC) therapies requires the establishment
of efficient methods to differentiate ESCs into specific cell lineages. Here, we 
report the in vitro differentiation of common marmoset (CM) (Callithrix jacchus) 
ESCs into hematopoietic cells after exogenous gene transfer using vesicular
stomatitis virus-glycoprotein-pseudotyped lentiviral vectors. We transduced
hematopoietic genes, including tal1/scl, gata1, gata2, hoxB4, and lhx2, into CM
ESCs. By immunochemical and morphological analyses, we demonstrated that
overexpression of tal1/scl, but not the remaining genes, dramatically increased
hematopoiesis of CM ESCs, resulting in multiple blood-cell lineages. Furthermore,
flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that CD34, a hematopoietic stem/progenitor 
cell marker, was highly expressed in tal1/scl-overexpressing embryoid body cells.
Similar results were obtained from three independent CM ESC lines. These results 
suggest that transduction of exogenous tal1/scl cDNA into ESCs is a promising
method to induce the efficient differentiation of CM ESCs into hematopoietic
stem/progenitor cells.

Individual olfactory signatures in common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus).

(1)Department of Biological Sciences, University of Chester, Chester, United
Kingdom. Teressa.smith@chester.ac.uk

Individual discrimination is likely a prerequisite for most primate social
interactions. Olfactory cues are one set of stimuli used by primates to
discriminate between individuals. Despite the importance of these olfactory
signatures, there is little published research assessing the existence or
function of individually unique odors among primates. This review systematically 
assesses behavioral and biochemical aspects of individual odors in a New World
primate, the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). There are three objectives to 
this review: First, behavioral evidence for odors unique to the individual is
evaluated in the context of results demonstrating that marmosets are able to
discriminate between the scents from a familiar and a novel individual
conspecific in behavioral bioassays under a variety of conditions. Second,
biochemical evidence for individual scent signatures is debated with reference to
studies examining qualitative and quantitative differences between the chemical
compositions of scent-mark pools from adult females. A combined gas
chromatography (GC) and mass spectrometry (MS) analysis demonstrated that each
female had a unique ratio of highly volatile chemicals in the scent mark that
could affect individual discrimination. Finally, the possible adaptive
significance of individual odors in marmosets is debated. Individual odors may
play a key role in regulating both female intrasexual competition and intersexual
communication by providing a basis for the assessment of individual quality.

Species and sex differences in susceptibility to vincristine sulphate
(VCR)-induced olfactory epithelial lesions were investigated among the BALB/c
mice, Crj: CD(SD) IGS rats and common marmoset monkeys following a single
intravenous administration on day 1. As dosage levels, the 0.17-fold LD10,
0.6-fold LD10 and LD10 were used for mice and rats, and a maximum tolerated dose 
(MTD) was chosen only for monkeys. The order of strength of VCR action on
peripheral neuropathic signs, body weight gain, and hematological parameters was 
mice > rats > monkeys, without clear sex differences. Histopathologically, on day
2, single cell death in the olfactory epithelium and vomeronasal organ was
observed only in male mice at LD10, and in female mice at 0.6-fold LD10 or more. 
On day 5, the olfactory epithelium in these mice showed regenerative
proliferation suggesting a sign of recovery. On day 10, axonopathy and
demyelination in the sciatic and trigeminal nerves were noted in mice of both
sexes at 0.6-fold LD10 or more. In rats and monkeys of either sex, however, no
morphological changes were observed at any dose level. In conclusion, mice,
particularly females, were shown to be more susceptible to VCR-induced apoptosis 
in the olfactory epithelium than rats and monkeys.

With the CAmbridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB),
computerized neuropsychological tasks can be presented on a touch-sensitive
computer screen, and this system has been used to assess cognitive processes in
neuropsychiatric patients, healthy volunteers, and species of non-human primate, 
primarily the rhesus macaque and common marmoset. Recently, we reported that the 
common marmoset, a small-bodied primate, can be trained to a high and stable
level of performance on the CANTAB five-choice serial reaction time (5-CSRT) task
of attention, and a novel task of working memory, the concurrent delayed
match-to-position (CDMP) task. Here, in order to increase understanding of the
specific cognitive demands of these tasks and the importance of acetylcholine to 
their performance, the effects of systemic delivery of the muscarinic receptor
antagonist scopolamine and the nicotinic receptor agonist nicotine were studied. 
In the 5-CSRT task, nicotine enhanced performance in terms of increased sustained
attention, whilst scopolamine led to increased omissions despite a high level of 
orientation to the correct stimulus location. In the CDMP task, scopolamine
impaired performance at two stages of the task that differ moderately in terms of
memory retention load but both of which are likely to require working memory,
including interference-coping, abilities. Nicotine tended to enhance performance 
at the long-delay stage specifically but only against a background of relatively 
low baseline performance. These data are consistent with a dissociation of the
roles of muscarinic and nicotinic cholinergic receptors in the regulation of both
sustained attention and working memory in primates.

Calcinosis circumscripta in a common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus jacchus).

A 2.5-y-old, male common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus jacchus) developed a 2-cm, 
interscapular, subcutaneous mass with variably firm and cystic areas. Radiographs
demonstrated a radiodense mass in close proximity to a previously implanted
microchip. Fine-needle aspiration yielded a chalky liquid that, on cytologic
examination, contained amorphous debris. Aerobic and anaerobic cultures were
negative. Surgical excision required extensive dissection, with the mass
infiltrating deep to the scapula and extending to the mammary gland. The mass
weighed 30 g and comprised 10% of the animal's body weight. Microscopic
examination demonstrated multifocal, variably sized, amorphous aggregates of
granular, basophilic material (mineral) in the subcutis and extending to skeletal
muscle. Mineral deposits were surrounded by macrophages, giant cells, and fibrous
connective tissue. A focal area of ectopic bone production was present.
Crystallographic analysis and x-ray diffractometry determined the material to be 
comprised of 100% hydroxyapatite. These findings were consistent with a diagnosis
of calcinosis circumscripta. Systemic metabolic abnormalities were excluded based
on examination of complete blood count, serum chemistry, and ionized calcium.
Calcinosis circumscripta in the common marmoset has not previously been reported,
although the lesion has been reported to occur in rhesus macaques and is well
described in man and dogs. Accumulation of calcium deposits and production of

Sleep quantitation data on the Neotropical primate species, apart from the
squirrel monkey, are still sparse. As such, we have quantitated sleep in the
common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus), cotton top tamarins (Saguinus oedipus) and
squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus) reared in one primate facility
simultaneously, by non-invasive actigraphy. The range in total sleep time/24h
measured for male adult common marmosets, cotton top tamarins and squirrel
monkeys were 713-793 min (n=4), 707-889 min (n=4) and 459-475 min (n=2)
respectively. The range in sleep episode length /12h dark phase for marmosets,
tamarins and squirrel monkeys were 21-52 min (n=3), 10-28 min (n=4) and 9-15 min 
(n=2) respectively. Since vigilance is a critical evolutionary adaptive feature
of predator avoidance among Callitrichid monkeys and squirrel monkeys, the
shorter ranges in sleep episode length recorded, even under captivity, in this
study could be interpreted as probable indicators of such vigilance behavior
during the rest phase. We hypothesize that the vigilance behavior when it exists 
during a primate's active phase should also prevail when it is at rest (sleep).
This hypothesis deserves additional testing in female Callitrichid monkeys.

Two hundred common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) from control groups (100 males,
100 females) of toxicological studies were examined histopathologically to
evaluate the spectrum of spontaneous lesions in this species. Frequent findings
were extramedullary hematopoiesis affecting adrenal glands, liver, kidney and
spleen, cystic Brunner's glands in the duodenum, acute or subacute inflammation
in the large intestine and gall bladder, renal mineralization and pigmentation,
hepatic Ito-cell vacuolation, microgranuloma and glycogen storage, pituitary
cysts, C-cell hyperplasia and lymphocytic foci of the thyroid gland, luteal
hyperplasia of the ovary and inflammatory cell foci in various organs.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a New World monkey species with a
limited MHC class II repertoire, is highly susceptible to certain bacterial
infections. Genomic analysis of exon 2 sequences documented the existence of only
one DRB region configuration harboring three loci. Two of these loci display
moderate levels of allelic polymorphism, whereas the -DRB*W12 gene appears to be 
monomorphic. This study shows that only the Caja-DRB*W16 and -DRB*W12 loci
produce functional transcripts. The Caja-DRB1*03 locus is occupied by a
pseudogene, given that most of the transcripts, if detected at all, show
imperfections and are present at low levels. Moreover, two hybrid transcripts
were identified that feature the evolutionarily conserved peptide-binding motif
characteristic for the Caja-DRB1*03 gene. Thus, the severely reduced MHC class II
repertoire in common marmosets has been expanded by reactivation of a pseudogene 
segment as a result of exon shuffling.

[Minamata disease: a neuropathological viewpoint].

Minamata disease (methylmercury poisoning) was first officially discovered around
Minamata Bay in the Kumamoto Prefecture on May 1st, 1956. This year, a
commemoration marking fifty years since this discovery of Minamata disease will
be held in Minamata City. Over the years, new facts have gradually surfaced,
especially after 1995, with the resolution of the political problems surrounding 
Minamata disease. For example, it was recently reported that large amounts of
methylmercury were generated by the chemical processes of the Chisso acetaldehyde
plant and later dumped directly into Minamata Bay. This report revealed the
August 1951 switch from using manganese dioxide to ferric sulfide as a reaction
promoter to maintain the activity of the Hg catalyst. As a result of this switch,
the amount of methylmercury generated in the process rapidly increased. Thus, the
true cause of the acute onset of Minamata disease in patients with a high-dose
contamination of methylmercury was made clear. The severe contamination by
methylmercury continued until 1968, when the plant finally stopped discharging
its waste water into Minamata Bay. In 1996, the National Institute for Minamata
Disease started an experimental study of methylmercury poisoning using the common
marmoset. Results from this study showed that the lesions characteristic of the
central nervous system in cases of acute methylmercury poisoning were promoted by
brain edema, while those of the peripheral nerves were caused by axonal
degeneration. Peripheral nerves were regenerated in two animals after two and a
half years. Lesions characteristic of Minamata disease are systematically found
throughout the nervous system. These lesions are found in the calcarine areas of 
occipital lobes, the pre- and post-central lobes, and the temporal transverse
gyri. Milder and more diffuse lesions are also found in the cerebrum, where
secondary degeneration of the central parts of white matter and internal sagittal
stratum are due to primary damage of neurons. Purkinje and granular cells
decrease in number in the cerebellum depending on the dose of methylmercury and
the duration of methylmercury exposure. In the spinal cord, there is no primary
change, but secondary degeneration is found on pyramidal tracts due to damage of 
the motor neurons of the precentral cortices. Additionally, secondary
degeneration of Goll's tract is seen due to the primary degeneration of sensory
nerve fibers including ganglion cells, sciatic nerves, and sural nerves. The
experiments on the methylmercury-treated common marmosets provided every feature 
of pathological change found in the nervous system in human autopsy cases,
depending on the dose of methylmercury.

Comment on
    Behav Brain Res. 2004 May 5;151(1-2):125-35.

The increasing trend in use of marmoset monkeys in behavioral studies has
necessitated a greater understanding of their natural behavior, especially within
confined spatial environments. One way to approach this issue is to examine
locomotor and exploratory strategies using the cylinder test, as done recently
for the rat by Gharbawie et al. [Gharbawie OA, Whishaw PA, Whishaw IQ. The
topography of three-dimensional exploration: a new quantification of vertical and
horizontal exploration, postural support, and exploratory bouts in the cylinder
test. Behav Brain Res 2004;151:125-35]. We have used this paradigm in conjunction
with Eshkol-Wachmann movement analysis in marmoset monkeys. We provide evidence
that marmosets display systematic changes in both horizontal and vertical
progressions during exploration. Quantitative analysis and comparison with the
extant data in rats showed both similarities and differences. For example, both
species display horizontal and vertical scanning movements, although the
variability is considerably greater for the marmoset. The horizontal progressions
consist of head scans, turning, and stepping. The amplitude of these progressions
oscillates and decreases with trial duration. Vertical progressions, which
consist of rears, head scans, and descent, also strongly oscillate but with
constant mean amplitude during a trial. The difference between the two species is
most evident in locomotor behavior. Rats use their forepaws primarily for
postural support and follow forequarter movements while body weight shifts are
generated by the hind limbs. Marmosets, however, can hold a vertical position
without hand support and display more complex movement characteristics during
exploration. The data from this study should be of use in designing experiments
in which marmosets are engaged in free-roaming behavior within a confined space.

Synthesis and evaluation of radioiodinated
(S,S)-2-(alpha-(2-iodophenoxy)benzyl)morpholine for imaging brain norepinephrine 
transporter.

PURPOSE: Abnormality of the brain norepinephrine transporter (NET) has been
reported in several psychiatric and neuronal disorders. Since NET is an important
target for the diagnosis of these diseases, the development of
radiopharmaceuticals for imaging of brain NET has been eagerly awaited. In this
study, we synthesized (S,S)-2-(alpha-(2-iodophenoxy)benzyl)morpholine
[(S,S)-IPBM], a derivative of reboxetine iodinated at position 2 of the phenoxy
ring, and evaluated its potential as a radiopharmaceutical for imaging brain NET 
using SPECT.
METHODS: (S,S)-(123/125)I-IPBM was synthesized in a halogen exchange reaction.
The affinity and selectivity of (S,S)-IPBM for NET was measured by assaying the
displacement of (3)H-nisoxetine and (S,S)-(125)I-IPBM from the binding site in
rat brain membrane, respectively. The biodistribution of (S,S)-(125)I-IPBM was
also determined in rats. Furthermore, SPECT studies with (S,S)-(123)I-IPBM were
carried out in the common marmoset.
RESULTS: (S,S)-(125)I-IPBM was prepared with high radiochemical yields (65%) and 
high radiochemical purity (>98%). (S,S)-IPBM showed high affinity and selectivity
for NET in the binding assay experiments. In biodistribution experiments,
(S,S)-(125)I-IPBM showed rapid uptake in the brain, and the regional cerebral
distribution was consistent with the density of NET. The administration of
nisoxetine, a selective NET-binding agent, decreased the accumulation of
(S,S)-(125)I-IPBM in the brain, but the administration of selective serotonin
transporter and dopamine transporter binding agents caused no significant changes
in the accumulation. Moreover, (S,S)-(123)I-IPBM allowed brain NET imaging in the
common marmoset with SPECT.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that (S,S)-(123)I-IPBM is a potential SPECT
radiopharmaceutical for imaging brain NET.

Orientation selectivity in the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus): the
periodicity of orientation columns in V1 and V2.

Orientation selectivity is a ubiquitous property of the primary visual cortex of 
mammals. Within the primate, orientation selectivity is arranged into vertical
columns that are organized into a regular patchy pattern. Previous studies, in
old world primates, have noted an anisotropy in this arrangement that appears to 
be due to the presence of ocular dominance columns within the same tissue. In
addition, orientation selective responses appear to be arranged into bands of
activity within the adjoining extrastriate region V2. Little is known about the
precise arrangement of orientation columns within V2. In this study, we examined 
the layout of orientation columns within both V1 and V2 of a new world primate,
the common marmoset, using optical imaging. New world primates have the advantage
that, unlike the macaque, V2 exists on the cortical surface, a requirement for
this form of optical mapping. We found the arrangement of orientation columns to 
be isotropic within marmoset V1 with an average repeat distance of around 575
mum, smaller than the repeat distance previously reported for the macaque. We
found no evidence of ocular dominance within the animals tested supporting the
claim that ocular dominance columns when present distort the mapping of
orientation in V1. In V2 we found that orientation columns were larger and as in 
other primates were represented in discrete bands throughout V2. Orientation
columns were spaced on average around 1 mm apart. This suggests that, at least in
the marmoset, the visual system maps orientation at a different scale within V1
and V2.

Suppression of prolactin does not reduce infant care by parentally experienced
male common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus).

High levels of prolactin have been found to correlate with the expression of
paternal care in a variety of taxa. However, in mammals, there is little
experimental evidence that prolactin is causally involved in the stimulation or
maintenance of paternal care. Here, we suppressed prolactin production in
paternally experienced common marmoset fathers in their family groups during the 
first 2 weeks after their infants were born. Circulating prolactin levels were
suppressed using cabergoline (Dostinex: Pfizer), a long acting dopamine (D2)
agonist with minimal behavioural side-effects. A within-subject design was used
to compare behavioural and hormonal data on 5 paternally experienced fathers
during two consecutive births. Cabergoline reduced prolactin to negligible levels
in all fathers without effecting testosterone, DHT and cortisol and without
adverse side-effects. However, lowering prolactin had no significant effect on
the expression of majority of the behaviour patterns associated with paternal
care. These included infant carrying, infant grooming and the frequency with
which fathers retrieved and rejected infants. The only infant-related behaviour
to be affected was the frequency with which fathers touched, licked and
investigated infants. We noted a marginally significant increase in this
behaviour during cabergoline treatment. Despite the lack of effect on paternal
care, cabergoline did exert an effect on the affiliative/sexual behaviour of
fathers as there was a significant increase in the grooming behaviour fathers
directed at and received from their mates during drug treatment. This study
showed that experienced male marmosets can express paternal behaviour in the
absence of the high prolactin levels normally seen after infants are born.

Pattern of maternal serum corticotropin-releasing hormone concentration during
pregnancy in the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).

Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), a potent neuropeptide, is produced by the 
placenta of anthropoid primates. No other mammals, including prosimian primates, 
are known to produce placental CRH. In humans, placental CRH appears to play an
important role in the progression of pregnancy to parturition. Maternal
circulating CRH begins to rise early in pregnancy and increases until
parturition. Gorillas and chimpanzees share this pattern of increasing maternal
CRH during pregnancy with humans. In humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas, maternal 
CRH and estradiol concentrations are correlated, consistent with the hypothesis
that CRH is involved in the biosynthetic pathway for placental estrogen
production. In contrast, in baboons, maternal circulating CRH rises precipitously
early in pregnancy and then declines, though CRH is detectable until birth. This 
research was designed to investigate the pattern of maternal circulating CRH in
the common marmoset during pregnancy. Blood samples were taken across gestation
from nine subjects over 11 pregnancies, and the plasma was assayed for CRH. The
pattern of maternal circulating CRH in the common marmoset was similar to that of
the baboon, with a rapid rise starting at about 50 days postconception and a peak
at approximately 70 days postconception. By 110 days postconception, CRH
concentration had plateaued at a significantly lower value. The peak and mean
values for CRH were associated with fetal number (e.g., females gestating
triplets had higher values than females gestating twins). Urinary estradiol
showed no association with plasma CRH concentration. Marmosets appear to differ
from the great apes in this regard, and to share a pattern of maternal CRH during
pregnancy with the baboon, indicating that the baboon and marmoset pattern may be
ancestral. The function of the early rapid rise of CRH in baboons and marmosets, 
and the significance of this difference between monkeys and apes, are not known.

Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) induced by myelin-oligodendrocyte
glycoprotein (MOG) in common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) is a model for
multiple sclerosis. Here, EAE was induced in four common marmosets by 250-300
microg recombinant rat MOG. In addition to a detailed disability scoring, T2- and
T1-weighted high-resolution 3D MRI was performed to assess the onset and
development of cerebral lesions. The findings were confirmed by histopathology in
all animals. Although the animals exhibited a large heterogeneity with regard to 
onset and localization of lesions and also to disease duration and severity of
disability signs, none of the animals revealed any evidence of recovery. A
specification of the disability scoring system to account for different aspects
of the disease led to a good concurrence of the first MRI-detectable lesion and
the onset of central nervous system (CNS) symptoms. The results suggest that MRI 
monitoring of white matter lesions in conjunction with disability scores that
focus on CNS symptoms may be a suitable method to evaluate novel therapeutic
interventions even in the presence of pronounced interindividual heterogeneity.

Elucidating coding of taste qualities with the taste modifier miraculin in the
common marmoset.

Wisconsin-Madison, 1655 Linden Drive, Madison, WI 53706, USA.

To investigate the relationships between the activity in different types of taste
fibers and the gustatory behavior in marmosets, we used the taste modifier
miraculin, which in humans adds a sweet taste quality to sour stimuli. In
behavioral experiments, we measured marmosets' consumption of acids before and
after tongue application of miraculin. In electrophysiological experiments
responses of single taste fibers in chorda tympani and glossopharyngeal nerves
were recorded before and after tongue application of miraculin. We found that
after miraculin marmosets consumed acids more readily. Taste nerve recordings
showed that after miraculin taste fibers which usually respond only to
sweeteners, S fibers, became responsive to acids. These results further support
our hypothesis that the activity in S fibers is translated into a hedonically
positive behavioral response.

Meiosis in autologous ectopic transplants of immature testicular tissue grafted
to Callithrix jacchus.

Grafting of immature testicular tissue provides a tool to examine testicular
development and may offer a perspective for preservation of fertility in
prepubertal patients. Successful xenografting in mice, resulting in mature
spermatids, has been performed in several species but has failed with testicular 
tissues from the common marmoset, Callithrix jacchus. Previous data indicate that
the hormonal milieu provided by the mouse host might cause this failure. We
conducted autologous ectopic transplantation of testicular fragments under the
back skin in newborn marmoset monkeys. Seventeen months after transplantation, we
found viable transplants in 2 out of the 4 grafted animals. In the transplants,
tubules developed up to a state intermediate between the pregraft situation and
adult controls. Dividing spermatogonia and primary spermatocytes were present.
Boule-like positivity and CDC25A negativity indicated that spermatogenesis was
arrested at early meiosis. Immunohistochemistry revealed normal maturation of
Sertoli cells, Leydig cells, and peritubular cells. Serum testosterone values
were not restored to the normal range and bioactive chorionic gonadotropin levels
increased to castrate levels. Meiotic arrest could have occurred in the grafts
because of lack of sufficient testosterone or because of hyperthermia caused by
the ectopic position of the grafts. We conclude that autologous transplants of
immature testicular tissues in the marmoset can mature up to meiosis but that
normal serum testosterone levels are not restored. Further studies have to be
performed to overcome the meiotic arrest to explore the model further and to
develop therapeutic options.

Marmoset monkey models of Parkinson's disease: which model, when and why?

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disease, with
clinical features of tremor, muscular rigidity and akinesia, occurring as a
result of midbrain dopamine loss. The search for treatments has relied heavily on
animal models of the disorder. The use of monkey models of PD plays a distinct
role in the development and assessment of novel treatments. The common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus) is a popular New World monkey used in the search for new
treatments. These monkeys are easy to handle and survive well in captivity. This 
review examines the advantages of using marmoset monkeys in PD research and
examines the different models available with reference to their use in
pre-clinical assessment for novel therapeutic treatments. The most common models 
involve the administration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)
or 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). Recently, selective cerebral transgenic
over-expression of alpha-synuclein has also been attempted in marmosets as a
potential model for PD. Each model has its advantages. The MPTP-based model in
marmosets resembles the disease with regards to the neuroanatomy of
neurotransmitter loss; the unilateral application of 6-OHDA allows for the
assessment of more complex sensorimotor deficits due to the presence of an intact
'control' side; the over-expression of alpha-synuclein in the midbrain results in
the slow onset of behavioural symptoms allowing for a pre-symptomatic time
window. The appropriateness of each of these marmoset models for the assessment
of treatments depends on several factors including the experimental aim of the
study and whether emphasis is placed on the analysis of behavioural deficits.

Synaptic connectivity in the midget-parvocellular pathway of primate central
retina.

Jusuf PR(1), Martin PR, Grünert U.

Author information: 
(1)The National Vision Research Institute of Australia, Carlton, Victoria 3053.

The synaptic connectivity of OFF midget bipolar cells was investigated in the
central retina of two primate species, the New World common marmoset monkey,
Callithrix jacchus, and the Old World macaque monkey, Macaca fascicularis. In
marmosets, dichromatic and trichromatic animals were compared. Bipolar output
synapses were identified with antibodies against ribbon proteins (kinesin,
C-terminal binding protein 2) or with an antiserum that recognizes postsynaptic
glutamate receptor clusters (GluR4). The midget bipolar cells were identified
immunocytochemically with antibodies to CD15 (marmoset) or an antiserum to
recoverin (macaque). In marmosets, midget ganglion cells were retrogradely
labeled from the parvocellular layers of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus.
Consistent with previous studies of Old World primates, in marmoset, midget
bipolar cells contacted midget ganglion cells at a ratio of 1:1. The number of
output synapses made by OFF midget bipolar cells was quantified for 104 cells in 
two dichromatic marmosets, 108 cells in one trichromatic marmoset, and 118 cells 
in one macaque. The number of output synapses was comparable for all animals,
ranging from 10-71 in the dichromatic marmoset (average 29.7 +/- 12.4 SD), 12-86 
in the trichromatic marmoset (average 28.6 +/- 11.7 SD) and 9-48 in the macaque
(average 26.5 +/- 9.3 SD) per axon terminal. In all animals the number of output 
synapses per axon terminal showed a unimodal distribution. Our results suggest
that the midget circuitry is comparable in dichromatic and trichromatic animals.

The seminiferous epithelium cycle length in the black tufted-ear marmoset
(Callithrix penicillata) is similar to humans.

MG, Brazil.

Marmosets are New World small primates phylogenetically close to humans and are
commonly used in biomedical research. Although the reproductive biology of the
common marmoset Callithrix jacchus is fairly well investigated, there are few
data available for testis function for its close relative, Callithrix
penicillata. In this regard, the present study was performed to investigate
testis structure, spermatogenic cycle length, and spermatogenic and Sertoli cell 
efficiencies in eight captive C. penicillata. These animals received
(3)H-thymidine injections and had their testes perfused-fixed with glutaraldehyde
and embedded in plastic at different time periods after (3)H-thymidine
injections, for histomorphometric and autoradiographic evaluation. The analysis
of the different germ cell associations showed that two or more stages were
observed in about 30% of the seminiferous tubule cross sections investigated. The
values found for spermatogenic cycle length and for total duration of
spermatogenesis in the marmoset C. penicillata, 15.4 and 69.3 days respectively, 
were very close to those cited in the literature for humans. However, the results
observed for Sertoli cell efficiency (number of round spermatids per Sertoli
cell; 8:1) and spermatogenic efficiency (daily sperm production per gram of
testis; 18.4 million) were substantially higher than those observed for humans.
The results found in the present investigation suggest that the black tufted-ear 
marmoset C. penicillata might represent an alternative and useful experimental
model to perform comparative studies regarding the spermatogenic process,

cells and the establishment of spermatogenic waves.

Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21205, USA.

This report describes a new modification of the Gallyas method for staining
myelin in fixed brain tissue and compares results of multiple myelin-visualizing 
techniques in normal common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), normal macaque monkey 
(Macaca mulatta), and a human with multiple sclerosis. The new modification
involves immersion in 10% formalin following impregnation in ammoniacal silver
nitrate, and the use of a low concentration of 4% paraformaldehyde in the
developer. This improved technique is less sensitive to post-mortem tissue
handling, temperature, and minor contaminants, allowing a more straightforward
implementation in the laboratory setting. It permits simple user-controlled
development of the reaction product to maximize contrast in the area of interest,
resulting in high contrast staining not only of large axonal bundles, but also
thin fascicles throughout tissue sections. Myelin staining in visual cortex of an
Old World monkey and a New World monkey reveals similar patterns in the new
myelin silver stain, the Gallyas stain, and myelin basic protein
immunohistochemistry. The most heavily myelinated areas occupy the edges of
blobs, but neither the most lightly stained nor the most darkly stained areas are
always in our outside a blob. This indicates a more complex pattern between
myelinated axons and blobs than previously suggested. While the new myelin silver
stain, darkfield microscopy, the Luxol Fast Blue stain, the Gallyas stain, and
myelin basic protein immunohistochemistry all permit visualization of myelin in
the CNS, each technique has its own merits and pitfalls; careful evaluation of
individual study requirements would best determine which methods are the most
useful.

Mosaic properties of midget and parasol ganglion cells in the marmoset retina.

of Optometry and Vision Sciences, The University of Melbourne, Australia.

We measured mosaic properties of midget and parasol ganglion cells in the retina 
of a New World monkey, the common marmoset Callithrix jacchus . We addressed the 
functional specialization of these populations for color and spatial vision, by
comparing the mosaic of ganglion cells in dichromatic ("red-green color blind")
and trichromatic marmosets. Ganglion cells were labelled by photolytic
amplification of retrograde marker ("photofilling") following injections into the
lateral geniculate nucleus, or by intracellular injection in an in vitro retinal 
preparation. The dendritic-field size, shape, and overlap of neighboring cells
were measured. We show that in marmosets, both midget and parasol cells exhibit a
radial bias, so that the long axis of the dendritic field points towards the
fovea. The radial bias is similar for parasol cells and midget cells, despite the
fact that midget cell dendritic fields are more elongated than are those of
parasol cells. The dendritic fields of midget ganglion cells from the same (ON or
OFF) response-type array show very little overlap, consistent with the low
coverage of the midget mosaic in humans. No large differences in radial bias, or 
overlap, were seen on comparing retinae from dichromatic and trichromatic
animals. These data suggest that radial bias in ganglion cell populations is a
consistent feature of the primate retina. Furthermore, they suggest that the
mosaic properties of the midget cell population are associated with high spatial 
resolution rather than being specifically associated with trichromatic color
vision.

Virtual vocalization stimuli for investigating neural representations of
species-specific vocalizations.

DiMattina C(1), Wang X.

Author information: 
(1)Laboratory of Auditory Neurophysiology, Department of Neuroscience, The Johns 
Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21205, USA.

Most studies investigating neural representations of species-specific
vocalizations in non-human primates and other species have involved studying
neural responses to vocalization tokens. One limitation of such approaches is the
difficulty in determining which acoustical features of vocalizations evoke neural
responses. Traditionally used filtering techniques are often inadequate in
manipulating features of complex vocalizations. Furthermore, the use of
vocalization tokens cannot fully account for intrinsic stochastic variations of
vocalizations that are crucial in understanding the neural codes for categorizing
and discriminating vocalizations differing along multiple feature dimensions. In 
this work, we have taken a rigorous and novel approach to the study of
species-specific vocalization processing by creating parametric "virtual
vocalization" models of major call types produced by the common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus). The main findings are as follows. 1) Acoustical parameters 
were measured from a database of the four major call types of the common
marmoset. This database was obtained from eight different individuals, and for
each individual, we typically obtained hundreds of samples of each major call
type. 2) These feature measurements were employed to parameterize models defining
representative virtual vocalizations of each call type for each of the eight
animals as well as an overall species-representative virtual vocalization
averaged across individuals for each call type. 3) Using the same
feature-measurement that was applied to the vocalization samples, we measured
acoustical features of the virtual vocalizations, including features not
explicitly modeled and found the virtual vocalizations to be statistically
representative of the callers and call types. 4) The accuracy of the virtual
vocalizations was further confirmed by comparing neural responses to real and
synthetic virtual vocalizations recorded from awake marmoset auditory cortex. We 
found a strong agreement between the responses to token vocalizations and their
synthetic counterparts. 5) We demonstrated how these virtual vocalization stimuli
could be employed to precisely and quantitatively define the notion of
vocalization "selectivity" by using stimuli with parameter values both within and
outside the naturally occurring ranges. We also showed the potential of the
virtual vocalization stimuli in studying issues related to vocalization
categorizations by morphing between different call types and individual callers.

Review on testicular development, structure, function, and regulation in common
marmoset.

BACKGROUND: The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a New World primate that 
has been used increasingly in toxicological evaluations including testing for
testicular toxicity of pharmaceutical and environmental chemicals. Information on
structural and functional characteristics of the testis in common marmosets
("marmoset" in this review) is critical for designing experiments, interpreting
data collected, and determining relevance to humans in risk assessment.
METHODS: This study provides a comprehensive review on testicular development,
structure, function, and regulation in common marmosets.
RESULTS: There is little information regarding testicular formation and
development during gestation. Based on the overall pattern of embryonic
development in marmosets, it is postulated that gonadal formation and testicular 
differentiation most likely takes place during gestational Week 6-12. After
birth, the neonatal period of the first 2-3 weeks and the pubertal period from
Months 6-12 are critical for establishment of spermatogenesis in the adult. In
the adult, a nine-stage model has been used to describe the organization of
seminiferous epithelium and multiple stages per tubular cross-section have been
observed. Seminiferous epithelium is organized in a wave or partial-wave manner. 
There are on average two stages per cross-section of seminiferous tubules in
adult marmoset testis. Sertoli cells in the marmoset have a uniform morphology.
Marmoset spermatogenesis has a high efficiency. The prime determinant of germ
cell production is proliferation and survival of spermatogonia. Sertoli cell
proliferation during the neonatal period is regulated by follicle-stimulating
hormone (FSH), but chorionic gonadotropin (CG), instead of luteinizing hormone
(LH), is the only gonadotropin with luteinizing function in marmoset. The
receptor gene for CG in marmoset is unique in that it does not have exon 10.
Marmosets have a "generalized steroid hormone resistance," i.e., relatively high 
levels of steroid hormones in circulation and relatively low response to
exogenous steroids. Blockage of FSH, CG, and testosterone production during the
first 3 months after birth does not cause permanent damage to the male
reproductive system. Initiation of spermatogenesis in the marmoset requires
unique factors that are probably not present in other mammals. Normal male
marmosets respond to estradiol injection positively (increased LH or CG levels), 
a pattern seen in normal females or castrated males, but not usually in normal
males of other mammalian species.
CONCLUSIONS: It seems that the endocrine system including the testis in marmosets
has some unique features that have not been observed in rodents, Old World
primates, and humans, but detailed comparison in these features among these
species will be presented in another review. Based on the data available,
marmoset seems to be an interesting model for comparative studies. However,
interpretation of experimental findings on the testicular effects in marmosets
should be made with serious caution. Depending on potential mode of testicular
actions of the chemical under investigation, marmoset may have very limited value
in predicting potential testicular or steroid hormone-related endocrine effects
of test chemicals in humans.

Mossy cells and different subpopulations of pyramidal neurons are immunoreactive 
for cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript peptide in the hippocampal
formation of non-human primates and tree shrew (Tupaia belangeri).

Cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript peptide mRNA was discovered in the 
rat striatum following cocaine and amphetamine administration. Since both
psychostimulants elicit memory-related effects, localization of cocaine- and
amphetamine-regulated transcript peptide in the hippocampal formation may have
functional importance. Previous studies demonstrated different cellular
localizations of cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript peptide in humans 
and in rodents. Mossy cells were cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated
transcript-positive in the human dentate gyrus, whereas granule cells contained
this peptide in the rat. In the present study, the localization of cocaine- and
amphetamine-regulated transcript peptide was examined using immunohistochemistry 
in the hippocampal formation of the rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta), the common
marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus) and in the tree shrew (Tupaia belangeri). In
these species principal neurons of the hippocampal formation were cocaine- and
amphetamine-regulated transcript-immunoreactive. In both monkeys and tree shrews,
mossy cells of the hilus were cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated
transcript-positive whereas granule cells of the dentate gyrus were cocaine- and 
amphetamine-regulated transcript-negative. The dense cocaine- and
amphetamine-regulated transcript-immunoreactive axonal plexus of the
associational pathway outlined the inner one-third of the dentate molecular
layer. In the hippocampus of the tree shrew and marmoset monkey, a subset of CA3 
pyramidal cells were cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated
transcript-immunoreactive. In the marmoset monkey, cocaine- and
amphetamine-regulated transcript labeling was found only in layer V pyramidal
cells of the entorhinal cortex, while in the rhesus monkey, pyramidal cells of
layers II and III were cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated
transcript-immunopositive. Our results show that cocaine- and
amphetamine-regulated transcript positive neurons in the dentate gyrus of
non-human primates are similar to that of the human. Furthermore, in the
hippocampal formation of the tree shrew similar cocaine- and
amphetamine-regulated transcript-immunoreactive cell-types were observed as in
monkeys, supporting their evolutionary relationship with primates. Mossy cells
and granule cells are members of a mutual excitatory intrahippocampal circuitry, 
therefore cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript-immunoreactivity of these
neurons in primates and rodents suggests that psychostimulants cocaine and
amphetamine may induce memory-related effects at different points of the same
excitatory circuitry in the hippocampal formation.

We examined the fine-scale mapping of the visual world within the primary visual 
cortex of the marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus) using differential optical
imaging. We stimulated two sets of complementary stripe-like locations in turn,
subtracting them to generate the cortical representations of continuous bands of 
visual space. Rotating this stimulus configuration makes it possible to map
different spatial axes within the primary visual cortex. In a similar manner,
shifting the stimulated locations between trials makes it possible to map
retinotopy at an even finer scale. Using these methods we found no evidence of
any local anisotropies or distortions in the cortical representation of visual
space. This is despite the fact that orientation preference is mapped in a
discontinuous manner across the surface of marmoset V1. Overall, our results
indicate that space is mapped in a continuous and smooth manner in the primary
visual cortex of the common marmoset.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a New World primate species
frequently employed for immunological models of human disease. We used flow
cytometry to screen a panel of new anti-human antibodies from the HLDA8 workshop 
to establish cross-reactivity with marmoset peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
Seventy-seven antibodies were screened of which nine antibodies showed binding.
Cross-reactivity of anti-human monoclonal antibodies with CC and CXC chemokine
receptors CCR3, CCR6, CCR7, and CCR8 was demonstrated on untreated marmoset
mononuclear cells. Stimulation of marmoset mononuclear cells with ConA and/or
PMA-ionomycin resulted in an up-regulated expression of CXCR1, CXCR3, and CXCR4. 
The expression of TNF-family related molecules TACI and APRIL on marmoset
mononuclear cells was also identified. These studies extend the range of
cross-reactive antibodies to now include anti-chemokine and anti-TNF family
antibodies for this important pre-clinical model species and should provide
useful tools for investigation of immunological processes in marmoset monkey
models.

Behavioral strategies and hormonal profiles of dominant and subordinate common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) females in wild monogamous groups.

New insights into the mating systems of common marmosets suggest that they are
mainly monogamous, although polygyny and polyandry occasionally occur. Long-term 
monitoring of wild common marmosets has shown that some reports of polygynous
groups (i.e., groups that contain more than one reproducing female) in fact
indicate an unbalanced reproductive output associated with extragroup copulation.
In this study we describe the behavioral and hormonal profiles of common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus) females living in three wild monogamous groups (Q, PBf, and 
T), varying from five to 11 individuals, at Nísia Floresta field station, RN,
Brazil. The mating system of the groups was previously characterized in terms of 
affiliative, sexual, and mate-guarding behaviors. Behavioral data were collected 
once a week, and fecal samples were collected at least twice a week for 10-16
months, depending on the group. A preferential allogrooming relationship was
recorded between dominant males and females. Under field conditions the
reproductive inhibition of subordinate females appears to be more behavioral than
hormonal, since subordinate females of the three groups ovulated and two
conceived during the study. In these cases, the subordinate and dominant females 
reproduced 1 month apart, and infanticide (one case confirmed and one suspected) 
appeared to be part of the reproductive strategy of dominant females. Following
the infanticide, ovarian inhibition (group T) or emigration and return to the
natal group (group PBf) were observed. In the third group (Q) the subordinate
female showed hormonal profiles compatible with pregnancy, but no infants were
seen. These findings reflect the different alternatives that wild subordinate
common marmoset females use to reproduce.

Meiotic abnormalities in in vitro-matured marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus)
oocytes: development of a non-human primate model to investigate causal factors.

Bulgaria.

BACKGROUND: Meiotic abnormalities are thought to be a major causal factor of low 
embryo development rates, for embryos developed from in vitro-matured oocytes. A 
new non-human primate model, in the common marmoset, is being developed to
facilitate investigation of the mechanisms involved.
METHODS: Oocytes were dissected from antral follicles from three size classes.
They were allowed to mature in vitro for only 24 h, in order to focus the
investigation on the rapidly maturing oocytes. Chromosome spreads were visualized
with Giemsa staining, and spindles /chromosomes with fluorescently labelled
anti-alpha-tubulin antibody combined with a DNA fluorochrome.
RESULTS: 40% of the oocytes had reached metaphase II (MII) after 24 h. Of the MII
oocytes selected for karyotyping, readable chromosomal spreads were obtained from
64%. Overall, 63% of these presented a normal haploid chromosome number of 23,X, 
with all abnormal karyotypes occurring in the oocytes from small follicles. For
another group of MII oocytes, where meiotic spindles were visualized, only half
of the MII oocytes displayed well-formed spindles and apparently correct
chromosomal alignment.
CONCLUSIONS: This work provides the first information on the normal and aneuploid
MII meiotic chromosome sets for the marmoset oocyte, and demonstrates a high rate
of chromosomal and spindle abnormality among rapidly maturing oocytes from small 
antral follicles.

Sensory-motor interactions modulate a primate vocal behavior: antiphonal calling 
in common marmosets.

A fundamental issue in neuroscience pertains to how different cortical systems
interact to generate behavior. One of the most direct ways to address this issue 
is to investigate how sensory information is encoded and used to produce a motor 
response. Antiphonal calling is a natural vocal behavior that involves
individuals producing their species-specific long distance vocalization in
response to hearing the same call and engages both the auditory and motor
systems, as well as the cognitive neural systems involved in decision making and 
categorization. Here we present results from a series of behavioral experiments
investigating the auditory-vocal interactions during antiphonal calling in the
common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). We manipulated sensory input by placing
subjects in different social contexts and found that the auditory input had a
significant effect on call timing and propensity to call. Playback experiments
tested the significance of the timing of vocal production in antiphonal calling
and showed that a short latency between antiphonal calls was necessary to
maintain reciprocal vocal interactions. Overall, this study shows that
sensory-motor interactions can be experimentally induced and manipulated in a
natural primate vocal behavior. Antiphonal calling represents a promising model
system to examine these issues in non-human primates at both the behavioral and
neural levels.

CASA as an aid to selecting sperm suspensions for artificial insemination in
Callithrix jacchus.

Morrell JM(1).

Author information: 
(1)Department of Reproductive Biology, German Primate Centre Göttingen, Germany.

The ability to use sperm motility parameters, obtained by computer-assisted sperm
motility analysis (CASA), as an aid to selecting sperm samples for artificial
insemination (AI) would have considerable benefits for commercial organizations
and for the captive breeding of endangered species. In this study the Hobson
sperm tracker (HST) was validated for use with spermatozoa from Callithrix
jacchus, the common marmoset, by comparing values for straight line velocity by
CASA with those obtained by direct measurement of sperm tracks. Using the
settings established during validation, ejaculated and epididymal spermatozoa
were analysed with the HST. The range of values for velocity parameters were used
to establish expected motility profiles for the two types of spermatozoa as
follows: for epididymal spermatozoa (concentration 2.2 - 85.8 x 10(6)
spermatozoa/mL) VCL 109.8-155.9, VSL 75.2-141.5, VAP 85.8-142.1, MAD 13.7-40.7,
ALH 3.8-7.8, BCF 1.4-4.2, LIN 40.5-91.1% and STR 70.1-97.1%; for ejaculated
spermatozoa (concentration 3.2-82.0 x 10(6) spermatozoa/mL) VCL 89.6-136.7, VSL
69.6-110.3, VAP 74.5-121.9, MAD 19.2-29.3, ALH 3.0-9.9, BCF 2.8-5.5., LIN
65.4-85.3% and STR 93.8-97.7%. Epididymal spermatozoa from males which were not
sexually active had significantly lower values for VCL, VSL and VAP, while values
for MAD were significantly higher than for spermatozoa from sexually active males
(p < 0.031). Sperm concentration affected motility parameters significantly.
Although motility parameters differed according to the batch of medium used, the 
differences were not statistically significant. Epididymal sperm samples had
significantly higher VCL, VSL and VAP but lower BCF and LIN than ejaculated sperm
samples of the same concentration diluted in the same batch of medium, while MAD,
ALH and STR were not different. Urine contamination significantly reduced VCL,
VSL and VAP (p < 0.008, < 0.016 and < 0.008, respectively, sample size = 7)
whereas MAD, ALH, BCF, LIN and STR were not affected. Therefore CASA could be
useful in screening ejaculates for use in Al to eliminate samples with unusual
motility patterns.

Hormonal changes related to paternal and alloparental care in common marmosets
(Callithrix jacchus).

Natal, Brazil. mtmota@cb.ufm.br

The physiological mechanisms of parental and alloparental care in cooperatively
breeding nonhuman primate species such as the common marmoset (Callithrix
jacchus) are poorly known. In this study, we examined prolactin and cortisol
plasma levels of fathers and older offspring of both sexes, with and without
previous experience in infant carrying, around parturition and during infant
carrying. Blood samples were collected from fathers and older offspring and
prolactin and cortisol were measured by RIA and EIA, respectively. Prolactin
levels of both caretakers were not influenced by infant's birth, previous
experience or proximity to parturition. However, prolactin levels increased in
both caretakers while in physical contact with infants and also with the number
of infants being carried in older offspring. These findings suggest that
increased prolactin seems to be mainly due to physical effort rather than a
physiological trigger of paternal and alloparental care in common marmosets.
Cortisol levels were higher for experienced fathers shortly before parturition
which could act to reinforce affiliative bonds between breeding males and females
at this time or in the ability of males to detect the proximity of the
parturition or both.

The successful establishment of human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines has
inaugurated a new era in regenerative medicine by facilitating the
transplantation of differentiated ESCs to specific organs. However, problems with
the safety and efficacy of hESC therapy in vivo remain to be resolved.
Preclinical studies using animal model systems, including nonhuman primates, are 
essential to evaluate the safety and efficacy of hESC therapies. Previously, we
demonstrated that common marmosets are suitable laboratory animal models for
preclinical studies of hematopoietic stem cell therapies. As this animal model is
also applicable to preclinical trials of ESC therapies, we have established novel
common marmoset ESC (CMESC) lines. To obtain marmoset embryos, we developed a new
embryo collection system, in which blastocysts can be obtained every 3 weeks from
each marmoset pair. The inner cell mass was isolated by immunosurgery and plated 
on a mouse embryonic feeder layer. Some of the CMESC lines were cultured
continuously for more than 1 year. These CMESC lines showed alkaline phosphatase 
activity and expressed stage-specific embryonic antigen (SSEA)-3, SSEA-4,
TRA-1-60, and TRA-1-81. On the other hand, SSEA-1 was not detected. Furthermore, 
our novel CMESCs are pluripotent, as evidenced by in vivo teratoma formation in
immunodeficient mice and in vitro differentiation experiments. Our established
CMESC lines and the common marmoset provide an excellent experimental model
system for understanding differentiation mechanisms, as well as the development
of regenerative therapies using hESCs.

Mobbing vocalizations as a coping response in the common marmoset.

Using a non-invasive method of sampling saliva followed by assay for cortisol
levels, we found that common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) show a decrease in
cortisol levels after seeing a snake-model stimulus that reliably elicits mobbing
(tsik) calls. In fact, there was a significant positive correlation between the
number of tsik vocalizations made and the magnitude of the decrease in the
cortisol concentrations. Furthermore, marmosets with higher levels of cortisol
prior to being exposed to the stimulus produce more tsik calls than those with
lower levels of cortisol. Subsequent experiments showed that, in response to 15
min of isolation with no visual or auditory contact with conspecifics (a
traditional stressor), cortisol levels increased significantly. However, playback
of the mobbing calls of a familiar conspecific to individual isolated marmosets
not only prevented the rise in cortisol, but also actually caused a decrease in
the levels of this hormone. This suggests that the mobbing calls serve to calm
the marmoset after experiencing a stressful situation. This finding results in a 
greater understanding as to the role of physiological responses during
communication in this species and could have implications for the welfare of
marmosets in captivity.

Ultrasonographic examinations were performed on 17 clinically healthy adult
common marmosets to gain information about the normal abdominal echoanatomy. The 
marmosets were 1.5-9 years of age and weighed between 328 and 506g. Marked
species-specific differences compared with the cat or dog were noted. Good images
of the kidneys, bladder, spleen, adrenal glands, liver, and the gastrointestinal 
tract could be obtained. The pancreas, caecum, and abdominal lymph nodes were not
seen. The spleen was the least echogenic organ, followed by the medium echogenic 
liver and the sometimes isoechoic, but mostly hyperechoic renal cortex. The
kidneys had a poor corticomedullary distinction. The prominent right lobes of the
liver extended caudally far beyond the costal arch. The gallbladder had a bi- to 
multi-lobed appearance with a wide, tortuous cystic duct. The pylorus was
centrally positioned. The adrenal glands were readily seen, but should not be
confused with the adjacent spleen. A statistically significant (P<0.05)
difference between female and male kidney, and right adrenal gland length was
present.

A standard radiographic procedure was developed for the thorax and abdomen in the
common marmoset. A description and reference values for the corresponding
radiographic anatomy are given. Radiographs were obtained from 17 anaesthetized
healthy mature marmosets ranging from 1.5 to 9 years and 328 to 506 g.
Left-to-right lateral recumbent and ventrodorsal whole-body radiographs made at
end inspiration are recommended. Images of the heart, lungs, liver, gastric axis,
and at least one kidney could be evaluated consistently. A generalized
interstitial/peribronchial pattern was normally present. The mean of the
vertebral heart size +/- SD on dorsoventral or ventrodorsal views was 9.42 (+/-
0.44), ranging from 8.8 to 10.6. Abdominal detail was generally poor. The
gastrointestinal structures could often only be identified because of their
luminal gas. The right liver lobes were prominent and extended caudally beyond
the costal arch. The pylorus was in a central position and the spleen could not
be distinguished. Additionally, pancreas, lymph nodes, urinary bladder, and
ureters were not identified. A statistically significant difference (P < or =
0.05) between female and male kidney length existed. This study emphasizes that
significant species differences exist, and simply applying canine or feline
radiographic interpretation will result in misinterpretation.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a significant emerging infectious
disease. Humans infected with the etiological agent, SARS-associated coronavirus 
(SARS-CoV), primarily present with pneumonitis but may also develop hepatic,
gastrointestinal, and renal pathology. We inoculated common marmosets (Callithrix
jacchus) with the objective of developing a small nonhuman primate model of SARS.
Two groups of C. jacchus were inoculated intratracheally with cell culture
supernatant containing SARS-CoV. In a time course pathogenesis study, animals
were evaluated at 2, 4, and 7 days after infection for morphological changes and 
evidence of viral replication. All animals developed a multifocal mononuclear
cell interstitial pneumonitis, accompanied by multinucleated syncytial cells,
edema, and bronchiolitis in most animals. Viral antigen localized primarily to
infected alveolar macrophages and type-1 pneumocytes by immunohistochemistry.
Viral RNA was detected in all animals from pulmonary tissue extracts obtained at 
necropsy. Viral RNA was also detected in tracheobronchial lymph node and
myocardium, together with inflammatory changes, in some animals. Hepatic
inflammation was observed in most animals, predominantly as a multifocal
lymphocytic hepatitis accompanied by necrosis of individual hepatocytes. These
findings identify the common marmoset as a promising nonhuman primate to study
SARS-CoV pathogenesis.

Nonhuman primates are of particular relevance in evaluating the potential
toxicity of drugs and environmental agents. We have used previously published
information and data from the present study to establish a relationship for New
World (NW) and Old World (OW) primates on the basis of the frequency of
spontaneous micronucleated erythrocytes (MNEs) observed in peripheral blood. Data
on spontaneous MNEs in peripheral blood from 15 species of primates, including
humans, indicate that NW primates have significantly (P < 0.01) higher MNE
frequencies (group mean, 9.5 +/- 7.3 MNEs/10,000 erythrocytes; range,
0.7-20.5/10,000 erythrocytes) than OW primates (group mean, 1.0 +/- 0.9
MNEs/10,000 erythrocytes; range, 0.0-2.6 MNEs/10,000 erythrocytes). Humans are
believed to have developed in the OW, and human MNE frequencies were similar to
those described for OW primate species. We selected the common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus), a NW primate, to determine whether therapeutic pediatric
doses of Metotrexate (MTX; 2.5 mg/kg), Cyclophosphamide (CP; 5 mg/kg),
Cytosine-arabinoside (Ara-C; 3 mg/kg), or 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU; 10 mg/kg),
administered daily for two consecutive days, increase the frequency of
micronuclei. Micronucleated polychromatic erythrocyte frequencies were increased 
significantly in groups receiving MTX, CP and Ara-C, while MNE frequencies were
increased by the Ara-C treatment. The results of this study indicate that NW
primates have higher spontaneous MNE frequencies than OW primates, and because of
this, NW primates like the common marmoset, may be suitable for evaluating the
genotoxicity of chemical agents.

Density, proportion, and dendritic coverage of retinal ganglion cells of the
common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus jacchus).

We performed a quantitative analysis of M and P cell mosaics of the
common-marmoset retina. Ganglion cells were labeled retrogradely from optic nerve
deposits of Biocytin. The labeling was visualized using horseradish peroxidase
(HRP) histochemistry and 3-3'diaminobenzidine as chromogen. M and P cells were
morphologically similar to those found in Old- and New-World primates.
Measurements were performed on well-stained cells from 4 retinas of different
animals. We analyzed separate mosaics for inner and outer M and P cells at
increasing distances from the fovea (2.5-9 mm of eccentricity) to estimate cell
density, proportion, and dendritic coverage. M cell density decreased towards the
retinal periphery in all quadrants. M cell density was higher in the nasal
quadrant than in other retinal regions at similar eccentricities, reaching about 
740 cells/mm(2) at 2.5 mm of temporal eccentricity, and representing 8-14% of all
ganglion cells. P cell density increased from peripheral to more central regions,
reaching about 5540 cells/mm(2) at 2.5 mm of temporal eccentricity. P cells
represented a smaller proportion of all ganglion cells in the nasal quadrant than
in other quadrants, and their numbers increased towards central retinal regions. 
The M cell coverage factor ranged from 5 to 12 and the P cell coverage factor
ranged from 1 to 3 in the nasal quadrant and from 5 to 12 in the other quadrants.
These results show that central and peripheral retinal regions differ in terms of
cell class proportions and dendritic coverage, and their properties do not result
from simply scaling down cell density. Therefore, differences in functional
properties between central and peripheral vision should take these distinct
regional retinal characteristics into account.

Hemispheric fine-grain maps of primary auditory cortex (AI) were derived from
microelectrode penetrations in the temporal gyrus of the common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus) to 1) compare the functional organization of AI in the
marmoset with other mammalian species and 2) compare the right and left AI maps
in individual monkeys. Frequency receptive fields (FRFs) were recorded with pure 
tones. Five FRF parameters were analyzed: characteristic frequency, threshold,
sharpness of tuning 10 dB and 40 dB above threshold, and minimum response
latency. The present study confirms that the functional organization of AI is
characterized by a robust tonotopic frequency gradient overlaid with spatially
clustered distributions of other FRF parameters. Globally, this functional
organization of AI in the common marmoset is similar to that in other mammalian
species. With respect to within-subject hemispheric comparisons of the five FRF
parameters, a coherent pattern of asymmetry is not evident in marmoset AI. The
overall results indicate that the basic functional organization between
hemispheres is similar but not identical.

A novel method of assessing muscle function in the common marmoset was developed 
as part of a multidisciplinary long-term study. The method involved home cage
presentation of a weight-pulling task. Over a 4-5 month period, 38 of 42 animals 
were successfully trained to displace weights of up to 920 g (mean 612+/-20 g).
Performance, following initial training, was stable and independent of gender or 
body weight.

Proteasomal activity in brain differs between species and brain regions and
changes with age.

Age-related increase in protein oxidation in brain coupled to an impairment of
proteasomal activity may underline neuronal loss but differences in
susceptibility between species and brain regions remain unexplained. We now
investigate differences in proteasomal activity, measured as chymotrypsin-,
trypsin- and peptidylglutamyl-like hydrolysing activities between brain regions
in rats, mice and common marmosets. In aged rats and mice, proteasomal activity
was decreased in the cortex, striatum, cerebellum, globus pallidus and substantia
nigra overall when compared to young animals. However, in the aged brain only
chymotrypsin-like activity was decreased in the cortex and the globus pallidus
while only trypsin-like activity was reduced in the cerebellum. In contrast, in
the striatum, both chymotrypsin-like and trypsin-like activities were reduced and
in the substantia nigra, all the three catalytic activities of proteasome were
significantly impaired. Chymotrypsin-like and trypsin-like activities were
significantly higher in all the brain regions of marmosets compared to those of
mice and rats. Peptidylglutamyl-like activity was only significantly higher in
the cerebellum and striatum of marmoset compared to rodents. The data suggest
that there is higher proteasome activity in common marmoset brain compared to rat
and mouse and that the basal ganglia are more prone to an age-related decrease in
proteasomal activity. This may explain the involvement of altered
ubiquitin-proteasome system activity in Parkinson's disease and the relationship 
to ageing.

In this study, we report the identification of a hitherto not reported direct
retinal projection to midline and intralaminar thalamic nuclei in the marmoset
brain. After unilateral intravitreal injections of cholera toxin subunit B (CTb),
anterogradely transported CTb-immunoreactive fibers and presumptive terminals
were seen in the following thalamic midline nuclei: paraventricular, rhomboid,
interanteromedial, and reuniens, and thalamic intralaminar nuclei: central
medial, central lateral, central dorsal, and parafascicular. Studies employing
sensitive tracers in other primate species are needed in order to verify the
possible universality of these projections. Some of the possible functional
correlates of the present data are briefly discussed. The present results may
contribute to the elucidation of the anatomical substrate of the functionally
demonstrated involvement of this midline/intralaminar thalamic nuclear complex in
several domains that include arousal and awareness, besides specific cognitive,
sensory, and motor functions.

Density gradient centrifugation is a widely used technique for the separation of 
motile from non-motile sperm, for the removal of contaminating agents such as
bacteria and viruses, and for the removal of seminal plasma or cryoprotectant. In
the choice of a density gradient medium for a new species, it is important to
perform toxicity tests. The present study was carried out to evaluate the
potential toxic effects of two silica-based density gradient products (Percoll
and PureSperm), on the sperm of the common marmoset. We assessed two different
batches of Percoll (polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-coated colloidal silica particles)
and one of PureSperm (saline-coated colloidal silica suspension) by means of a
computer-aided sperm analysis on semen collected by vibrostimulation. The results
showed that although some of the sperm patterns of movement and viability changed
significantly over time, and provide a first description of marmoset sperm
motility changes under capacitating conditions, there was no significant
difference in the sperm treated with Percoll or PureSperm in comparison with the 
control. We conclude that simple exposure to either of these products does not
have a negative effect on viability or motility of marmoset sperm.

Central to many emotional responses is the accompanying peripheral somatic and
autonomic arousal, feedback from which has been hypothesized to enhance emotional
memory and to contribute to appraisal processes and decision making, and
dysfunction of which may contribute to antisocial behaviour. Whilst peripheral
arousal may accompany both positive and negative emotional contexts, its
relationship with the former is poorly understood, as are the neural mechanisms
underlying such a relationship. The purpose of the present study was to determine
the autonomic correlates of anticipation, as well as consumption, of high
incentive food, in the freely moving common marmoset and to investigate the
contribution of the amygdala to such effects. Blood pressure (BP) and heart rate 
(HR) were measured remotely by a telemetric device implanted into the descending 
aorta and behavioural responses were monitored whilst marmosets viewed preferred 
or non-preferred foods and were then allowed access to eat those foods. A marked 
rise in blood pressure in unrestrained marmosets was observed in response both to
the sight of highly preferred foods (anticipatory period) as well as during the
actual consumption of those foods (consummatory period). Excitotoxic lesions of
the amygdala abolished the autonomic arousal in the anticipatory period, but
spared both the behavioural arousal in the anticipatory period and the autonomic 
arousal in the consummatory period. Together these data serve as an important
step towards understanding the role of autonomic arousal in emotion and its
neural underpinnings.

The mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) are nuclear 
transcription factors that mediate many of the basal and stress functions and
effects of the corticosteroid hormones, including those related to brain
development. Despite this, relatively little is known about the postnatal
ontogeny of MR and GR gene and protein expression in the central nervous system, 
and this is particularly true of the primates, including humans. Here we describe
the postnatal ontogeny of central MR and GR gene and protein expression in the
common marmoset monkey. By developing marmoset-specific riboprobes and using in
situ hybridization, it was demonstrated that MR mRNA expression in the dentate
gyrus and Ammon's horn was significantly greater in marmoset infants (aged 4-6
weeks) than in neonates (1-2 days), juveniles (4-5 months) and adults (3-6
years), with expression in the latter three ontogenetic stages being broadly
similar. In the same subjects and ontogenetic stages, GR mRNA expression was
developmentally consistent in the marmoset dentate gyrus and Ammon's horn, as
well as in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus. Qualitative
immunohistochemical comparison of infants and adults demonstrated that MR protein
expression in the hippocampus was, as for mRNA, also greater in infants than
adults, and that hippocampal GR protein was, as for mRNA, also similar in infants
and adults. The increase in MR mRNA expression between the stages of neonate and 
infant co-occurred with a reduction in basal plasma ACTH and cortisol titres. The
ontogenetic profiles of MR and GR gene expression in the marmoset monkey are
therefore fundamentally different from those described for the rat and the mouse.
This evidence for the postnatal ontogeny of central corticosteroid nuclear
receptor expression in a primate is important for understanding both the
developmental stage-specific significance of stress exposure and its potential
long-term effects on health and disease.

Ejaculates from the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) contain semenogelin and 
beta-microseminoprotein but not prostate-specific antigen.

Human seminal plasma contains high concentrations of prostatic acid phosphatase
(PAP), prostate-specific antigen (PSA), beta-microseminoprotein (MSP),
semenogelin I (SgI), and semenogelin II (SgII), whereas only PAP and MSP are
present in rodents. In order to gain a better understanding of the evolution and 
function of semen proteins, we have studied ejaculates from the common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus)-a New World monkey. Semen samples were analyzed with
SDS-PAGE, Western blotting, and isoelectric focusing. Under reducing conditions
the dominating protein components appear as heterogeneous material of 55-70 kDa
and distinct protein bands of 85, 17, 16, and 15 kDa. The heterogeneous material 
contains glycosylated material detected by an antiserum recognizing both human
SgI and SgII. Southern blotting indicates that the common marmoset has genes for 
both SgI and SgII. There are several marmoset MSP genes, but the strong
immunoreactivity against one 15 kDa semen component with pI 7.3 suggests
preferential expression of one gene in the prostate. Expression of two other
genes cannot be excluded as indicated by weak reaction to isoforms with pI 6.6
and 4.9. Unexpectedly, PSA was not detected by either immunological methods or
activity measurements. This is in agreement with results from Southern blotting
suggesting that the common marmoset might not have a PSA gene. Thus, in this
study we have shown that semen coagulum proteins are present in marmoset seminal 
plasma, but the lack of PSA precludes a similar liquefaction as of human semen.

Most previous studies on spinal cord injury (SCI) have used rodent models. Direct
extrapolation of the results obtained in rodents to clinical cases is difficult, 
however, because of neurofunctional and anatomic differences between rodents and 
primates. In the present study, the development of histopathologic changes and
functional deficits were assessed quantitatively after mild, moderate, and severe
spinal cord contusive injuries in common marmosets. Contusive SCI was induced by 
dropping one of three different weights (15, 17, or 20 g) at the C5 level from a 
height of 50 mm. Serial magnetic resonance images showed significant differences 
in the intramedullary T1 low signal and T2 high signal areas among the three
groups. Quantitative histologic analyses revealed that the number of motor
neurons, the myelinated areas, and the amounts of corticospinal tract fibers
decreased significantly as the injury increased in severity. Motor functions were
evaluated using the following tests: original behavioral scoring scale,
measurements of spontaneous motor activity, bar grip test, and cage-climbing
test. Significant differences in all test results were observed among the three
groups. Spontaneous motor activities at 10 weeks after injury were closely
correlated with the residual myelinated area at the lesion epicenter. The
establishment of a reliable nonhuman primate model for SCI with objective
functional evaluation methods should become an essential tool for future SCI
treatment studies. Quantitative behavioral and histopathologic analyses enabled
three distinct grades of injury severity (15-g, 17-g, and 20-g groups) to be
characterized with heavier weights producing more serious injuries, and
relatively constant behavioral and histopathologic outcomes.

Response properties of primary auditory cortical neurons in the adult common
marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus) were modified by extensive exposure to
altered vocalizations that were self-generated and rehearsed frequently. A
laryngeal apparatus modification procedure permanently lowered the frequency
content of the native twitter call, a complex communication vocalization
consisting of a series of frequency modulation (FM) sweeps. Monkeys vocalized
shortly after this procedure and maintained voicing efforts until physiological
evaluation 5-15 months later. The altered twitter calls improved over time, with 
FM sweeps approaching but never reaching the normal spectral range. Neurons with 
characteristic frequencies <4.3 kHz that had been weakly activated by native
twitter calls were recruited to encode self-uttered altered twitter
vocalizations. These neurons showed a decrease in response magnitude and an
increase in temporal dispersion of response timing to twitter call and parametric
FM stimuli but a normal response profile to pure tone stimuli. Tonotopic maps in 
voice-modified monkeys were not distorted. These findings suggest a previously
unrecognized form of cortical plasticity that is specific to higher-order
processes involved in the discrimination of more complex sounds, such as
species-specific vocalizations.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a small New World primate native to
Brazil that has been used extensively in biomedical research. A retrospective
analysis of archived hematoxylin and eosin-stained tissue sections and clinical
records was conducted at the New England Primate Research Center on 86 marmosets 
more than 1 year of age that were euthanized during the past decade because of
morbidity and failure to thrive. Approximately 17% (15 of 86) were found to have 
amyloid deposits in one or more organs, including the liver, adrenal glands,
kidneys, and intestine. This material was shown by amino acid sequence analysis
to be composed of serum amyloid A (SAA)-related protein. This type of
amyloidosis, designated AA or "secondary," is associated typically with an
inflammatory process that induces elevated levels of the SAA amyloidogenic
precursor molecule. Notably, there were no significant pathologic differences or 
other distinguishing features in animals with amyloid versus those without;
furthermore, on the basis of the limited number of serum specimens available for 
analysis, the SAA concentrations in the two groups were comparable, thus
suggesting the possible inheritable nature of the disorder. In this respect, the 
common marmoset provides a unique experimental model for study of the
pathogenesis and treatment of AA and other forms of systemic amyloidosis.

working memory in marmoset monkeys.

RATIONALE: LY354740 is a recently developed metabotropic glutamatergic receptor 2
and 3 (mGluR2/3) agonist. A high density of mGluR2 has been reported in terminal 
fields of the perforant path in rodents and humans, suggesting its involvement in
cognitive functions mediated by the temporal lobe, including memory. A small
number of in vivo studies in rodents have assessed the effects of LY354740 on
memory tasks, reporting the induction of impaired memory for spatial orientation 
in a water maze task and for delayed match and non-match to position in an
operant version of these tasks.
OBJECTIVE: In the present primate study, we used radioautography to describe the 
distribution and intensity of (3)H-LY354740 binding in the hippocampal formation 
of the common marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus) relative to the rat. In the
major, in vivo part of the study, the effects of systemic LY354740 on
computerized tasks of attention and memory were investigated.
METHODS: Adult common marmosets were trained to perform a five-choice serial
reaction time (5-CSRT) task and a concurrent delayed match-to-position (CDMP)
task from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Automated test Battery (CANTAB).
Filter tests of LY354740 effects on motor dexterity and motivation for reward
revealed high inter-individual variation in sensitivity; therefore, on the
5-CSRT, subjects were tested at a dose range of 3--10 mg/kg, and on the CDMP,
subjects were tested at 1--3 or 3--10 mg/kg.
RESULTS: Radioautography revealed a relatively low level of (3)H-LY354740 binding
in the marmoset hippocampal formation compared to the rat. Despite low binding,
LY354740 reduced sustained-attention accuracy in the 5-CSRT, and reduced accuracy
in two stages of the CDMP.
CONCLUSIONS: The current study provides novel evidence for the importance of
mGluR2/3 in the regulation of primate cognitive functioning.

In common marmoset monkeys (Callithrix jacchus, order Primates), infants aged
2-28 days were deprived of parental care for 30-120 min/day in order to
investigate the long-term effects of this neglect-stress model on affect and
cognition in a primate species. Basal morning levels of urinary cortisol across
the first year of life were unaffected in early deprived marmosets relative to
their sibling controls. Basal morning levels of urinary dopamine were chronically
increased. This peripheral increase in dopamine activity could represent a marker
for central dopamine hyperactivity. Certainly, subadult early deprived marmosets 
exhibited performance deficits in two dopamine-regulated neuropsychological
tasks. They demonstrated: (1) impaired behavioral inhibition in an object
reaching with detour task, exhibiting significantly more nonreinforced forward
reaches to a reward visible inside a cube that could only be retrieved through an
opening to the side of the cube; and (2) impaired reversal learning in a two-way 
discrimination task based on visual icons presented on a touch-sensitive computer
screen. These findings provide further evidence for the relevance of this novel
primate model of parent-infant neglect to the environmental causes and mechanisms
of human developmental psychopathology.

Continuous low-level glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor delivery using
recombinant adeno-associated viral vectors provides neuroprotection and induces
behavioral recovery in a primate model of Parkinson's disease.

The therapeutic potential of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF)
for Parkinson's disease is likely to depend on sustained delivery of the
appropriate amount to the target areas. Recombinant adeno-associated viral
vectors (rAAVs) expressing GDNF may be a suitable delivery system for this
purpose. The aim of this study was to define a sustained level of GDNF that does 
not affect the function of the normal dopamine (DA) neurons but does provide
anatomical and behavioral protection against an intrastriatal 6-hydroxydopamine
(6-OHDA) lesion in the common marmoset. We found that unilateral intrastriatal
injection of rAAV resulting in the expression of high levels of GDNF (14 ng/mg of
tissue) in the striatum induced a substantial bilateral increase in tyrosine
hydroxylase protein levels and activity as well as in DA turnover. Expression of 
low levels of GDNF (0.04 ng/mg of tissue), on the other hand, produced only
minimal effects on DA synthesis and only on the injected side. In addition, the
low level of GDNF provided approximately 85% protection of the nigral DA neurons 
and their projections to the striatum in the 6-OHDA-lesioned hemisphere.
Furthermore, the anatomical protection was accompanied by a complete attenuation 
of sensorimotor neglect, head position bias, and amphetamine-induced rotation. We
conclude that when delivered continuously, a low level of GDNF in the striatum
(approximately threefold above baseline) is sufficient to provide optimal
functional outcome.

Fecal androgen levels in common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) males living in
captive family groups.

Castro DC(1), Sousa MB.

Natal, RN, Brazil.

In captive common marmoset groups, the reproductive inhibition observed in
subordinate female seems to be a result of olfactory, visual and behavioral cues 
from the dominant female. However, few studies have examined the relationship
among adult males living in the same social group. These studies have shown that 
reproductive failure among peer males seems to be based on hormonal and
behavioral mechanisms. New insights on sexual strategies in primates have been
shown using fecal steroids, but so far no information is available for common
marmoset males. In the present study, we evaluated the influence of light-dark
cycle, age and reproductive condition on the profile of fecal androgens in males 
living in the same family group. Feces were collected from six fathers and six
sons for androgen determination during the light phase of the 24-h cycle for
eight days randomly distributed over a 4-week period. Androgen levels were
determined by enzyme immunoassay technique. Adult sons showed higher androgen
levels (166.97 +/- 22.95 ng/g) than fathers (80.69 +/- 44.38 ng/g) and juveniles 
(49.06 +/- 23.15 ng/g; P < 0.05). No diurnal variation (P > 0.05) in fecal
androgen profile was observed in adults or juveniles. No indication of
androgen-mediated social competition between fathers and adult sons was
demonstrable. These results provide basic information on fecal androgen profile
useful to investigate the socioendocrinology of free-ranging common marmoset
males and verify that, in contrast to daughters, the reproductive suppression of 
sons is not based on physiological inhibition of their gonads.

marmosets.

Common marmoset monkeys (Callithrix jacchus) live in small groups in which,
usually, only a single female breeds and all group members provide infant care.
When two females breed concurrently, however, they may commonly kill one
another's infants, especially during the peripartum period. To investigate the
mechanisms underlying infanticide by breeding females, we characterized responses
of multiparous females to infants and determined circulating hormone levels in
adult females during early pregnancy, late pregnancy, and the early postpartum
period. Additionally, we compared the responses of postpartum females to their
own infants and infants of other females (unfamiliar infants). Postpartum females
were highly maternal toward both their own and unfamiliar infants, and showed no 
differences in their behavioral or hormonal responses to the two. During both
early and late pregnancy, however, these females exhibited longer latencies to
initially approach unfamiliar infants and spent less time carrying unfamiliar
infants. Moreover, females spent less time carrying unfamiliar infants during
late pregnancy than early pregnancy. Most late pregnant females never carried
infants, and those that did rejected them quickly. Prolactin concentrations were 
higher and progesterone concentrations lower postpartum than in early or late
pregnancy, while estradiol concentrations, the estradiol-to-progesterone ratio,
and cortisol levels were higher during late pregnancy. Within reproductive
conditions, however, maternal behaviors were not correlated with hormone levels. 
These results suggest that maternal responsiveness in marmosets may be attenuated
during pregnancy, especially late pregnancy, and this may contribute to
infanticide by breeding females.

Recovery from experimental Parkinson's disease in the
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine hydrochloride treated marmoset with 
the melatonin analogue ML-23.

A new mechanism has been recently proposed, whereby melatonin may participate in 
the ongoing process of neuronal degeneration in models of neurodegenerative
disorders, such as Parkinson's disease (PD). Antagonism of the melatonin receptor
in rats using constant light or pinealectomy induced recovery and reduced the
mortality typically associated with dopamine (DA) degeneration. In additional
studies, employing ML-23 in the 6-OHDA-treated rat, remission from experimental
PD was achieved using this drug in a post 6-OHDA treatment regime. To permit the 
further assessment of ML-23 as a potential clinical candidate for the treatment
of PD, the present study was undertaken to determine the efficacy of ML-23 in the
1-methyl-4-phenyl, 1,2,3,6 tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) model in the common
marmoset. ML-23 was administered orally in a dose of 3 mg/kg twice daily to half 
of the animals, while the other half received vehicle only, in a blinded
protocol, for 56 days. The effects of the treatment on positive and negative
features of MPTP-induced PD were assessed, including horizontal and vertical
movement, head checking, general behaviour and Parkinsonian condition, raisin
board performance, the ability to remove a foot label, palatable and dry food
intake, water consumption, bradykinaesia, and the positive symptoms of tremor,
obstinate progression, and agitation. On all parameters, ML-23 produced a
significant remission from MPTP-induced Parkinsonism, and this effect did not
abate when ML-23 treatment was withdrawn. In a further pilot study involving a
crossover of two animals, one animal treated previously with MPTP plus vehicle
showed some remission of negative and positive features, although ML-23 treatment
was not commenced until 8 weeks post-MPTP. Conversely, a recurrence of
Parkinsonian signs was not observed when ML-23 treatment was withdrawn and
substituted with oral vehicle. Dopamine transporter was severely impaired in all 
marmosets treated with ML-23 or vehicle for the duration of the study. These
results suggest that a novel mechanism involving melatonin is involved in the
primary aetiology of the chronic aspects of PD, and such a mechanism is not
related to the antioxidative function of this hormone. From these preliminary
results, it is concluded that ML-23 and other melatonin analogues have an
important role to play in the treatment and clinical management of Parkinson's
disease.

Development of prolactin levels in marmoset males: from adult son to first-time
father.

Schradin C(1), Anzenberger G.

Author information: 
(1)Anthropologisches Institut und Museum, CH-8057 Zürich, Switzerland.

Previous studies have found a clear relationship between prolactin (prl) and
paternal care in various vertebrate taxa. In New World monkeys, it has been
demonstrated in several species that fathers have high prolactin levels even
during periods without infant rearing. In this study, we followed the
reproductive careers of common marmoset males as they transitioned from being an 
adult son within their native family to fathering their own offspring for the
first time. Specifically, we examined the first experience of elevated prolactin 
levels in marmoset males. Additionally, we investigated the effects of the total 
number of experienced births as well as of age on prolactin levels. Our results
show that common marmoset males did not experience an increase in prolactin
secretion after pairing or shortly before birth of their first infants. However, 
prolactin levels rose more than twofold after the birth of their first infants
and had lowered again 2.5 months after this event. We found no correlation
between prolactin levels and the number of previous births experienced or age.
Our study demonstrates that further work about a possible enhancing effect of
prolactin on paternal care, by means of experimentally reducing hormonal levels, 
should be conducted in common marmosets using first-time fathers before males
experience the first paternal increase in prolactin levels.

Investigation of marmoset hybrids (Cebuella pygmaea x Callithrix jacchus) and

comparative genomic hybridization.

Maximilian University, Munich, Germany.

We report on the cytogenetics of twin offspring from an interspecies cross in
marmosets (Callitrichinae, Platyrrhini), resulting from a pairing between a
female Common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus, 2n = 46) and a male Pygmy marmoset
(Cebuella pygmaea, 2n = 44). We analyzed their karyotypes by multi-directional
chromosome painting employing human, Saguinus oedipus and Lagothrix lagothricha
chromosome-specific probes. Both hybrid individuals had a karyotype with a
diploid chromosome number of 2n = 45. As a complementary tool, interspecies
comparative genomic hybridization (iCGH) was performed in order to screen for
genomic imbalances between the hybrids and their parental species, and between
Callithrix argentata and S. oedipus, respectively. These genomic imbalances were 
confined to centromeric and telomeric heterochromatin, while euchromatic
chromosome regions appeared balanced in all species investigated. When comparing 
marmosets and tamarins, sequence divergence of centromeric heterochromatin was
already clearly noticeable. In the C. argentata and C. pygmaea genomes numerous
subtelomeric regions were affected by amplification of different repetitive
sequences. Cross-species FISH with a microdissection-derived C. pygmaea
repetitive probe revealed species specificity of this repetitive sequence at the 
molecular cytogenetic level of resolution.

The invasiveness of biomedical experiments on laboratory animals should be
limited to the greatest extent possible yet without sacrificing the quality of
the data collected. To this end, refinement techniques can be used. In the
present work, we describe some of these techniques, focussing on the familiarity 
of the experimental environment, alternative sampling techniques (including the
use of positive training), telemetry, and methods for improving ethological
experiments. As a model, we have chosen the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus),
which is frequently used in biomedical research.

In this paper, we discuss issues concerning the welfare of non-human primates
used in laboratory research from an eco-ethological standpoint and suggest means 
of improving welfare. Following a brief review of the use of non-human primates
in European countries and of the legislation that governs this use, we illustrate
how a thorough eco-ethological knowledge of the species being studied can play a 
vital role in improving both its conditions and the quality of the experimental
protocols, arguing that the animal's quality of life is closely linked to the
quality of data. As a model for describing environmental enrichment techniques,
we have used the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).

Energy restriction initiated at different gestational ages has varying effects on
maternal weight gain and pregnancy outcome in common marmoset monkeys (Callithrix

With relatively high fertility and short lifespan, marmoset monkeys (Callithrix
jacchus) may become useful primate models of prenatal nutritional effects on
birth condition and adult disease risk. The present study determined the effects 
of energy restriction to 75% of expected ad libitum consumption during mid- (day 
66) or late (day 99) gestation on maternal weight, fetal growth and pregnancy
outcomes in this species. Mid-restriction reliably induced the loss of pregnancy 
before term, at 92 d, on average. Of the late-restricted pregnancies, four of
seven were normal term length while three were preterm deliveries, at 101, 117
and 132 d. Control females had a mean mid-pregnancy weight gain of 0.67 g/d while
mid-restricted females lost -0.65 g/d, on average. Control pregnancies averaged a
1.06 g/d gain during late pregnancy, while energy-restricted females lost -0.67
g/d, on average. Restriction-related weight change was highly variable, ranging
from +0.55 to -2.56 g/d for mid-restriction pregnancies and from +0.79 to -3.91
g/d for late-restriction pregnancies. For mid-restriction pregnancies, the number
of restriction days was best explained by linear weight change and total weight
loss while the number of restriction days in late pregnancy was best explained by
linear weight change alone. In late-restriction pregnancies, smaller females had 
higher daily weight losses. Restrictions did not induce litter-size reduction or 
growth restriction in those infants that were delivered at term but the size of
aborted fetuses suggested that at least some pregnancies lost preterm may have
involved impaired intra-uterine growth.

Eye preferences in common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus): influence of age,
stimulus, and hand preference.

Eye preferences of the common marmoset ( Callithrix jacchus ) were examined,
taking into account age, arousal, and hand preference. Monocular eye use for
looking through a small hole at a stimulus was recorded. Of 21 marmosets, 20
displayed right-eye preferences for viewing a piece of familiar food. In subjects
tested at 3-8, 12, 15-18, and 22 months, eye preferences were consistent across
age. A group bias, indicative of right-eyedness, was also found for viewing other
stimuli. The stimuli included a watch, mirror, model of a beetle, and the
experimenter's hand. However, when the marmosets viewed a threatening stimulus, a
model resembling two rearing snakes, they displayed increased arousal (indicated 
by longer duration between monocular viewing events and increased incidence of
aroused vocalisations) and the eye preferences shifted away from a preference for
the right eye to either no preference or a left-eye preference. No relationship
between eye preference and hand preference for holding food was found. Therefore,
we suggest that eye preferences may reflect hemispheric specialisations for
perceptual processing, according to the emotional valence of the stimulus.

A noninvasive method of saliva sampling was used to assess the diurnal cortisol
rhythm from 0900 to 1700 hr in the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). The
levels of cortisol were highest in the morning and declined significantly over
the day. Individual marmosets varied in the magnitude of the cycle, and the
greatest individual variability occurred in the morning levels. The decrease in
cortisol levels was more rapid after than before the midday feeding period in
subordinate marmosets (aged 53-63 months) compared to dominant marmosets (aged
79-80 months), and overall, the levels of cortisol were higher in the subordinate
marmosets. We found no effect of sex on cortisol levels across the cycle.

Endocrine changes in full-term pregnancies and pregnancy loss due to energy
restriction in the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).

Common marmosets, a New World primate, respond to a modest energy restriction
with early termination of the pregnancy. Within female marmosets, comparisons (n 
= 6) between a normal, term pregnancy and a restriction-induced aborted pregnancy
were used to establish cortisol, free estradiol, and chorionic gonadotropin (CG) 
as urinary markers of placental and fetal function under these two conditions.
Abortions occurred 11-47 d after a 25% energy reduction during midpregnancy for
all females. Cortisol concentrations were significantly lower in the last 2 wk
for the restricted pregnancy than for matched samples in the normal term
pregnancy. Both estradiol and estrone were examined in free and conjugated forms.
Only free estradiol showed a significant reduction in mean concentrations during 
midpregnancy for the restricted females compared with their normal, term
pregnancies. Mean CG levels from each female served as an independent marker of
placental differentiation and function. CG levels were significantly lower during
the 2 wk before abortion compared with matched days from a normal, term
pregnancy. These data provide evidence that estradiol and cortisol are useful
markers of placental and fetal viability in the common marmoset, and their
reduced concentration following energy restriction suggests that restriction is
not acting as a classical stressor by increasing cortisol and, subsequently,
estradiol concentration.

Novel restraint system for neuroendocrine studies of socially living common
marmoset monkeys.

We describe a novel soft jacket and sling-harness restraint that permits
species-typical postures for small-bodied primates, such as the common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus), during long-term (>6 h), continuous restraint. The
restraint system is straightforward to use and manipulate, it is easily repaired,
and the materials used are readily available. The soft jacket allows for
increased versatility and longevity, and the sling-harness provides for greater
movement and much longer duration of continuous restraint (up to 3 days) compared
to a previously described, more conventional chair restraint for small-bodied
primates. The new restraint system prevents the normal diurnal decrease in plasma
cortisol levels across the daylight hours; however, it does not disrupt ovulatory
cycles. Unlike the previously available techniques, therefore, this new restraint
system is applicable to many neurobiological and neuroendocrine studies involving
small-bodied, non-human primates and is especially suited to investigations
requiring the maintenance of relationships within social groups.

Fetal and infant head circumference sexual dimorphism in primates.

Studies have shown that after controlling for the effects of body size on brain
size, the brains of adult humans, rhesus monkeys, and chimpanzees differ in
relative size, where males have a greater volume of cerebral tissue than females.
We assess whether head circumference sexual dimorphism is present during early
development by evaluating sex differences in relative head circumference in
living fetuses and infants within the first year of life. Head circumference is
used as a proxy for brain size in the fetus and infant. Femur length is used as a
proxy for body length in the fetus. Ultrasonography was used to obtain fetal
measures, and anthropometry was used to obtain postnatal measures in humans,
rhesus monkeys, baboons, and common marmosets. We show that statistically
significant but low levels of head circumference sexual dimorphism are present in
humans, rhesus monkeys, and baboons in early life. On average, males have head
circumferences about 2% larger than females of comparable femur/body length in
humans, rhesus monkeys, and baboons. No evidence for head circumference sexual
dimorphism in the common marmoset was found. Dimorphism was present across all
body size ranges. We suggest that head circumference sexual dimorphism emerges
largely postnatally and increases throughout maturation, particularly in humans
who reach adult dimorphism values greater than the monkeys. We suggest that brain
dimorphism is not likely to impose an additional energetic burden to the
gestating or lactating mother. Finally, some of the problems with ascribing
functional significance to brain size sexual dimorphism are discussed, and the

The many, highly specific, biological therapies for immune-based diseases create 
a need for valid preclinical animal models. The wide immunological gap between
human beings and laboratory mouse or rat models makes many disease models in
these species invalid. In this review, we report a non-human-primate model of
chronic multiple sclerosis (MS)-experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE) in the
common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus)-that can help bridge this wide gap. The
genetic and immunological similarity of marmosets and human beings and the
clinical and neuropathological similarity of the EAE model to MS provide a unique
experimental platform for research into basic immunopathogenetic mechanisms and
for the development of more effective treatments for MS.

Common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) demonstrate significant variation in
reproductive output on both a yearly and lifetime basis in comparison to other
anthropoid primates. We explore the factors that may be most important in
determining reproductive variation in captive common marmosets. Studies have
found that maternal age, maternal condition, and dam survivorship are related to 
reproductive output; however, these reports are not in agreement and are far from
conclusive. With the use of a large, multicolony, demographic database pooling
data across five marmoset colonies, we examined litter information for 1,649
litters, and reproductive summaries for 400 dams to assess 1) how reproductive
output variation (total production, total weaned production) is determined by
litter size, interbirth interval (IBI), age at first birth, and dam survival age;
2) the relationship between maternal age and reproductive output variables; and
3) relationship between the reproductive output variables and survival. We used
stepwise regression procedures to describe the amount of variation in lifetime
reproductive output among dams, and found that mean litter size accounted for 18%
of the variance in total production, survival age accounted for 10.6%, age at
first birth accounted for 8.8%, and mean IBI accounted for 5%. For total
(nonzero) weaned production, survival age accounted for 7.6% of variance, age at 
first birth accounted for 7.2%, mean IBI accounted for 2%, and mean litter size
accounted for 1.6%. We identified significant effects (P<0.05) of maternal age on
litter size and IBI length, but no effect of dam age on weaned litter size. Cox
proportional hazards regression analyses revealed significant effects (P<0.01) of
number of litters, age at first birth, and site on dam survivorship. Dams that
produced more litters showed higher survivorship. Age at first birth showed a
positive relationship with dam survivorship, i.e., dams that delayed first
reproduction had higher survival. Our findings about reproductive variation in
marmosets may have practical applications for the management of marmoset breeding
colonies.

OBJECTIVE: We focused on a small New World monkey, the common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus), to establish a nonhuman primate model of the treatment of
hematological disorders. In this study, we developed the first monoclonal
antibodies (MAbs) against marmoset CD34 and tested the in vitro and in vivo
hemopoietic activity of cell populations isolated using one of these MAbs.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Marmoset cDNA encoding a human CD34 homologue was cloned
from bone marrow (BM)-derived RNA using reverse transcription polymerase chain
reaction and rapid amplification of cDNA ends. The amino acid sequence of the
marmoset CD34 had 81% homology with the human sequence. Five mouse MAbs were
raised against marmoset CD34 transfectant. One representative MAb, MA24 (IgM),
reacted with approximately 0.5 to 1% of BM mononuclear cells (MNCs), where the
colony-forming unit granulocyte/macrophage (CFU-GM) was enriched approximately
11- to 75-fold as compared with the whole BM MNCs. Multilineage differentiation
of marmoset CD34+ cells in NOD/SCID mice was confirmed by flow cytometry 1 month 
after xenotransplantation.
CONCLUSION: These results demonstrated that MA24 is useful for the analysis and
enrichment of hematopoietic progenitor cells in the marmoset model for
preclinical experiments.

Lateral interactions in the perception of flicker and in the physiology of the
lateral geniculate nucleus.

The perception of flicker strength in a center stimulus can be affected by the
presence of a surrounding stimulus. We correlated this effect with the
interactions between centers and surrounds of the receptive fields (RFs) of
neurons in the retino-geniculate pathways. The responses of cells in the lateral 
geniculate nucleus (LGN) of two New World monkey species, the common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus), and the owl monkey (Aotus azarae) were measured to two
spatially non-overlapping sinusoidally modulating luminance stimuli of equal
temporal frequency, one of which mainly stimulated the RF center, the other the
RF surround. The relative temporal phase between the center and surround stimuli 
was varied. The response amplitude as a function of relative phase between the
center and surround stimuli can be described by a simple model where the RF
center and surround responses are vector-added. A minimal response was reached
for stimuli in which the surround stimulus led the center stimulus, indicating
that the RF surround response lagged the center response. The flicker strength in
the center stimulus perceived by human observers was measured psychophysically.
It was found that the perceived flicker strength could be described by the same
function as was used for the cell data. There were qualitative similarities
between the physiological and the psychophysical data, suggesting that the
physiological basis of the psychophysically measured spatial interactions is
present as early as the LGN. The data indicated the presence of a nonlinearity in
center-surround interactions that is influenced by the stimulus contrast. The
possible source of this nonlinearity was studied by comparing the center and the 
surround responses with those in which they were selectively stimulated.

In order to evaluate Callithrix jacchus as an animal model for mansoni
schistosomiasis, a group of 10 male animals were once percutaneously exposed to
250 cercariae of the Schistosoma mansoni SLM (São Lourenço da Mata) strain.
Animals were periodically bled for measuring serum level of enzymes and proteins 
and for blood cell counting. When comparing pre-infection to post-infection
values, a significant increase was found for alkaline phosphatase at 15 to 120
days p.i., differential counts of eosinophil at 45 and 60 days, and total protein
and global eosinophil counts at 120 days. No Schistosoma mansoni eggs were found 
in stools. Adult worms of small size were recovered from five animals. At day
120, the number of Schistosoma mansoni eggs/g of tissue was 0-289.7 (liver),
0-30.1 (large intestine) and 0-171.4 (small intestine). These findings lead us to
classify Callithrix jacchus as a non-permissive host to the SLM strain of
Schistosoma mansoni.

GB virus B (GBV-B) is a flavivirus that is related closely to hepatitis C virus
(HCV) and induces an acute hepatitis when inoculated into several species of New 
World primates. Common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) are a widely available,
non-endangered primate species that is susceptible to GBV-B infection and
develops a characteristic acute hepatitis. Here, animals were found to be
susceptible to serially passaged serum and GBV-B transcripts. Hepatic pathology
and peripheral viraemia could be quantified biochemically, immunophenotypically
and morphologically, and persisted for periods of up to 6 months in some animals.
Hepatitis was characterized by a marked influx of CD3+ CD8+ T lymphocytes and
CD20+ B cells within the first 2 months of primary infection. The results of this
study document the marmoset as another small, non-human primate species in which 
the pathogenesis of GBV-B can be studied and used as a surrogate model of HCV
infection for investigation of pathogenesis and antiviral drug development.

Co-expression of calretinin and gamma-aminobutyric acid in neurons of the
entorhinal cortex of the common marmoset monkey.

Author information: 
(1)Behavioral Neurobiology Laboratory, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology
Zurich, Schwerzenbach, Switzerland.

The gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-containing interneuron population in the
entorhinal cortex has been shown to consist of several subpopulations. In
addition to GABA, these neurons contain another neurochemical substance, such as 
a neuropeptide or a calcium binding protein. In the present study, we examined
the co-localization of calretinin and GABA in the entorhinal cortex of the common
marmoset Callithrix jacchus, a New World monkey. Although the function of
calretinin remains unclear, there are indications that it might have a protective
role against cell death in a number of neuropathological diseases. Furthermore,
it might have a regulatory role in the neurotransmission of GABAergic neurons. In
contrast to the rat brain, sparse data exist regarding the degree of
co-expression of these two markers in the monkey brain. Using immunofluorescence 
and confocal laser scanning microscopy, we found that an average of 56% of the
calretinin-positive neurons in the monkey entorhinal cortex contained GABA,
whereas about 27% of the GABA-positive neurons co-expressed calretinin.
Interestingly, these numbers were higher in the superficial layers of the
entorhinal cortex in comparison with the deep layers. However, no differences
were found in co-localization percentages between the different entorhinal
subfields. In general, the degree of co-localization was higher in comparison to 
findings in the rat entorhinal cortex. The higher amount of co-localization
observed in the present study might reflect species differences between the
primate and the non-primate brain.

Comparative analysis of masseter fiber architecture in tree-gouging (Callithrix
jacchus) and nongouging (Saguinus oedipus) callitrichids.

Common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) and cotton-top tamarins (Saguinus oedipus) 
(Callitrichidae, Primates) share a broadly similar diet of fruits, insects, and
tree exudates. Common marmosets, however, differ from tamarins by actively
gouging trees with their anterior teeth to elicit tree exudate flow. During tree 
gouging, marmosets produce relatively large jaw gapes, but do not necessarily
produce relatively large bite forces at the anterior teeth. We compared the fiber
architecture of the masseter muscle in tree-gouging Callithrix jacchus (n = 10)
to nongouging Saguinus oedipus (n = 8) to determine whether the marmoset masseter
facilitates producing these large gapes during tree gouging. We predict that the 
marmoset masseter has relatively longer fibers and, hence, greater potential
muscle excursion (i.e., a greater range of motion through increased muscle
stretch). Conversely, because of the expected trade-off between excursion and
force production in muscle architecture, we predict that the cotton-top tamarin
masseter has more pinnate fibers and increased physiological cross-sectional area
(PCSA) as compared to common marmosets. Likewise, the S. oedipus masseter is
predicted to have a greater proportion of tendon relative to muscle fiber as
compared to the common marmoset masseter. Common marmosets have absolutely and
relatively longer masseter fibers than cotton-top tamarins. Given that fiber
length is directly proportional to muscle excursion and by extension contraction 
velocity, this result suggests that marmosets have masseters designed for
relatively greater stretching and, hence, larger gapes. Conversely, the
cotton-top tamarin masseter has a greater angle of pinnation (but not
significantly so), larger PCSA, and higher proportion of tendon. The
significantly larger PCSA in the tamarin masseter suggests that their masseter
has relatively greater force production capabilities as compared to marmosets.
Collectively, these results suggest that the fiber architecture of the common
marmoset masseter is part of a suite of features of the masticatory apparatus
that facilitates the production of relatively large gapes during tree gouging.

Expression in a recombinant murid herpesvirus 4 reveals the in vivo transforming 
potential of the K1 open reading frame of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated
herpesvirus.

Murid herpesvirus 4 (commonly called MHV-68) is closely related to Kaposi's
sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) and provides an excellent model system for 
investigating gammaherpesvirus-associated pathogenesis. MHV-76 is a naturally
occurring deletion mutant of MHV-68 that lacks 9,538 bp of the left end of the
unique portion of the genome encoding nonessential pathogenesis-related genes.
The KSHV K1 protein has been shown to transform rodent fibroblasts in vitro and
common marmoset T lymphocytes in vivo. Using homologous recombination techniques,
we successfully generated recombinants of MHV-76 that encode green fluorescent
protein (MHV76-GFP) and KSHV K1 (MHV76-K1). The replication of MHV76-GFP and
MHV76-K1 in cell culture was identical to that of MHV-76. However, infection of
BALB/c mice via the intranasal route revealed that MHV76-K1 replicated to a
10-fold higher titer than MHV76-GFP in the lungs at day 5 postinfection (p.i.).
We observed type 2 pneumocyte proliferation in areas of consolidation and
interstitial inflammation of mice infected with MHV76-K1 at day 10 p.i. MHV76-K1 
established a 2- to 3-fold higher latent viral load than MHV76-GFP in the spleens
of infected mice on days 10 and 14 p.i., although this was 10-fold lower than
that established by wild-type MHV-76. A salivary gland tumor was present in one
of four mice infected with MHV76-K1, as well as an increased inflammatory
response in the lungs at day 120 p.i. compared with that of mice infected with
MHV-76 and MHV76-GFP.

OBJECTIVE: Although olfactory disturbance appears to occur in the early stages of
Parkinson's disease (PD) in humans, little is known about its mechanism. The aim 
of this study was to make a PD model using injection of
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) in the common marmoset and to
discover the mechanism of olfactory disturbance in this animal.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Olfactory disturbance induced by MPTP in the common
marmoset was observed by behavioral, biochemical and immunohistochemical means.
RESULTS: Administration of MPTP caused common marmosets to enter an akinetic
state within a few days and to show signs of impaired olfactory function.
Biochemical study showed a decrease in dopamine levels, especially in tissue
samples from the caudate nucleus and putamen. Immunohistochemical analysis
revealed a lack of tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity, not only in the
substantia nigra, caudate nucleus and putamen but also in the olfactory tubercle.
CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that MPTP causes both PD-like symptoms and 
olfactory disturbance in the common marmoset. The olfactory disturbance observed 
in these animals may be due to the lack of dopamine in the olfactory tubercle.

The evolutionary conservation of the human chitotriosidase gene in rodents and
primates.

Chitinases have been identified in a variety of organisms ranging from
prokaryotes to eukaryotes, known to specifically degrade chitin, an abundant
polymer of N-acetylglucosamine. Recently a human chitinolytic enzyme called CHIT1
was discovered. CHIT1 is expressed by activated macrophages and hydrolyzes
artificial chitotrioside substrates, but its specific function in humans is
unknown, since it is generally believed that man completely lacks endogenous
chitin and endogenous substrates for chitinases. An intriguing question is
whether the chitotriosidase activity is just an evolutionary remnant or it has a 
physiological function in man. To test these hypotheses we utilized a
"phylogenomic" approach performing accurate sequence analyses of this gene,
coding for CHIT1, in rodents and primates. Inspecting the sequences available in 
public databases, we determined that this gene is conserved in rodents (mouse and
rat) and primates (chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, gibbon, baboon, a common
marmoset and black macaque). Moreover we found that a 24-base pair duplication
that determines an enzymatically inactive human protein is not present in
primates, suggesting that this polymorphism was created during human evolution.
These results indicate that chitotriosidase is conserved across the evolutionary 
scale. Such conservation of the CHIT1 gene argues in favour of an important
biological role.

Cloning of oestrogen receptor beta from Old and New World primates:
identification of splice variants and functional analysis.

Oestrogens have a major impact on reproductive function in both males and
females. Two oestrogen receptor genes known as ERalpha (ESR1NR3A1) and ERbeta
(ESR2NR3A2) have been cloned. Splice variant isoforms of the ERbeta gene have
been identified in human, bovine and rodents and it has been suggested that the
existence of these forms can influence oestrogen responsiveness. In the human,
splicing of an alternative eighth exon results in the formation of a C-terminal
variant called hERbetacx, or hERbeta2, but this isoform has not been identified
in other species. The aim of the present study was to clone ERbeta cDNAs from
primates so as to determine how closely they resembled the ERbeta isoforms found 
in the human. The two species studied were the stump-tailed macaque (Macaca
arctoides), an Old World primate, and the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus
jacchus), a New World primate. Full length ERbeta (wild type, ERbeta1) cDNAs were
cloned from macaque and marmoset; they encoded proteins of similar size to those 
found in human (59 and 54 kDa, long and short forms respectively) and shared
significant sequence homology (97.5% in macaque and 93.8% in marmoset) with the
human peptide sequence. Full length cDNAs homologous to the hERbeta2 variant were
identified in both primates. Marmoset ERbeta2 was slightly shorter than that of
human ERbeta2 (54 kDa compared with 55 kDa) and did not contain the peptide
sequence used to raise an anti-hERbeta2 antibody. All the macaque ERbeta2 cDNAs
contained 56 bp of intronic sequence which included an in-frame stop codon
resulting in translation of a truncated protein ( approximately 35 kDa). In all
three species, truncated, alternatively spliced mRNAs lacking exon 5 were
isolated on multiple occasions from all tissue extracts. In transient
transfection assays, ERbeta2-containing constructs were unable to induce
transcription of an oestrogen response element (ERE) reporter plasmid in the
presence of oestradiol. ERbeta1 from human, macaque and marmoset exhibited minor 
differences in their ability to induce transcription of the ERE reporter when
incubated with different ligands (oestradiol, PPT, DPN,
5-alpha-androstane-3-beta, 17beta-diol (3betaAdiol), genistein) and this may be
due to amino acid substitutions within their ligand binding domains. In
conclusion, we have identified and cloned wild type ERbeta (ERbeta1) from macaque
and marmoset and demonstrated that splice variant mRNAs homologous to hERbeta2
are formed in both species. The marmoset monkey, therefore, provides a suitable
animal model in which to investigate the impact of ERbeta variant expression on
tissue responsiveness to oestrogens.

Localization and synthesis of zona pellucida proteins in the marmoset monkey
(Callithrix jacchus) ovary.

In most species, the zona pellucida (ZP), an extracellular matrix surrounding the
mammalian oocyte, is composed of three glycoproteins: ZPA, ZPB and ZPC. Based
mainly on results with mice, the site of zona pellucida biosynthesis has been
suggested to be exclusively in the oocyte cytoplasm. However, evidence is
accumulating that among various species cumulus/granulosa cells may be involved. 
Because knowledge of ZP biosynthesis in primates is lacking, we used the common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) to acquire information about the localization and
the site of synthesis of ZP proteins in this species. Using antibodies against
synthetic ZPA and ZPC peptides, immunoreactivity was found in the marmoset ZP and
in surrounding cumulus cells. Interestingly, the amounts of ZPA and ZPC proteins 
expressed appeared to differ depending on the stage of folliculogenesis. RT-PCR
analysis of mRNA from marmoset oocytes and from oocyte-free follicle cells
revealed expression of ZPA, ZPB and ZPC in oocytes and in follicle cells of
different stages of marmoset monkey folliculogenesis. Our data suggest that the
biosynthesis of marmoset ZPA, ZPB and ZPC proteins takes place both in oocytes
and in follicle cells of different follicle stages, although the abundance of ZP 
glycoproteins may differ depending on the individual ZP protein.

Morphological evidence for two types of Mammalian vomeronasal system.

Neuroscience, 2-6 Musashidai, Fuchu, Tokyo 183-8526, Japan.

The vomeronasal (VN) systems of rodents and opossums are of the segregated type, 
i.e alpha-subtype G protein Gi2- or Go-expressing VN neurons, which are sensory
cells, project discretely to the rostral or caudal region of the accessory
olfactory bulb (AOB). Although this zone-specific projection is believed to be a 
common feature for processing pheromones in mammals, we previously found a
uniform-type VN system in goat in which only Gi2-expressing VN axons terminate at
the AOB. In most mammals, it remains unclear whether their VN systems are of the 
segregated or uniform type. Therefore, we investigated morphologically the VN
systems of different mammalian species (dog, horse, musk shrew and common
marmoset). Consequently, all VN axons of the examined animals were positively
stained with immunohistochemistry for Gi2 in the same way as that in the goat. On
the other hand, we observed immunoreactivities against Go in the olfactory axons,
but not in the VN axons. These results suggest that many mammals have
uniform-type VN systems, and at least two types of VN systems exist in
terrestrial mammals. This morphological evidence will help us determine the
processing function of VN systems.

Apocrine glands of Moll are regular components of primate eyelids. We studied the
distribution and localization of these glands in three different primate species,
the common marmoset, the rhesus monkey, and the hamadryas baboon. In addition, we
tested the primate glands of Moll with antibodies against antimicrobial proteins,
cytoskeletal proteins and the androgen receptor. The glands of Moll differ in
abundance and distribution in different monkeys. In the common marmoset, a
representative of the New World monkeys, Platyrrhini, the apocrine glands are
frequently found at the lid margin and in the overlying epidermis of the lid. In 
the rhesus monkey and the hamadryas baboon, representatives of Old World monkeys,
Catarrhini, apocrine glands are rarer and located predominantly at the margin of 
the lid. The immunohistochemical analysis indicates the presence of a variety of 
antimicrobial proteins, e.g. lysozyme, beta-defensin-2, adrenomedullin,
lactoferrin, and IgA, in these glands. Interestingly, there are basically no
androgen receptors in the nuclei of apocrine glands at the lid margin in all
three monkey species. In the common marmoset, however, androgen receptors are
found in apocrine glands of the overlying epidermis of the lid. We speculate that
the glands of Moll are derived from apocrine glands as found in the skin of the
entire body in New World monkeys which developed at the lid margins of higher
primates and humans into specialized glands secreting agents of host defense in

New insights are presented into the collagenous structure of the primate cornea. 
Wide-angle X-ray diffraction was used to map the fibrillar arrangement and
distribution of collagen over three common marmoset corneas. The maps provide a
point of reference to help interpret data from pathological corneas or primate
models of refractive surgery. The results herein disclose a circum-corneal
annulus of highly aligned collagen, 0.5-1.5 mm wide, where the cornea and sclera 
fuse at the limbus; a feature similar to that observed in human tissue. As in
humans, the annulus is not uniform, varying in width, fibril angular spread, and 
collagen density around its circumference. However, more centrally the marmoset
cornea exhibits a preferred lamella orientation in which proportionally more
fibrils are oriented along the superior-inferior corneal meridian. This
observation is in striking contrast with the situation in human cornea, where
there is an orthogonal arrangement of preferentially aligned fibrils.
Investigation of a further 16 corneas confirmed that approximately 33% (+/-1%) (n
= 76) of fibrils in the central marmoset cornea lie within a 45 degrees sector of
the superior-inferior meridian. Implications for the mechanical and optical
properties of the cornea are discussed.

Calbindin-D28K, parvalbumin and calretinin in primate lower motor neurons.

It has been suggested that lower motor neurons containing calcium-binding
proteins (CBP) may be resistant to degeneration in motor neuron disease. The
testing of this hypothesis is hampered by lack of comprehensive information
regarding the presence of CBPs in motor neurons. To address this shortcoming, we 
investigated the distribution of the CBPs calbindin-D28K (CB), parvalbumin (PV)
and calretinin (CRT) in lower motor neurons in the normal human and two non-human
primates (rhesus monkey and common marmoset) using immunohistochemistry. A
variable proportion of motor neurons in cranial nerve motor nuclei contained
immunoreactivity for one or more CBPs. A subpopulation of spinal cord alpha-motor
neurons was also CBP-positive. Comparison of staining for choline
acetyltransferase (ChAT) and CBPs in the human spinal cord demonstrated that
approximately 63% of ventral horn motor neurons contained PV, 53% contained CRT
and 56% contained CB. CBP immunoreactivity within motor neurons was of variable
staining intensity. It remains to be established whether the presence of these
CBPs confers protection against the pathogenic mechanisms of motor neuron
disease.

Sense of taste in a New World monkey, the common marmoset. II. Link between
behavior and nerve activity.

Danilova V(1), Hellekant G.

Wisconsin-Madison, 1655 Linden Drive, Madison, WI 53706, USA.

In a previous study, we characterized the gustatory system of a New World monkey 
the common marmoset, Callithrix jacchus jacchus, with electrophysiological
techniques by recording from taste fibers of the chorda tympani proper (CT) and
glossopharyngeal (NG) nerves. Hierarchical cluster analysis identified three
clusters of taste fibers: S fibers, responding predominantly to sweeteners, Q
fibers, responding predominantly to bitter stimuli, and H fibers, responding
predominantly to acids. In this study, we employed two behavioral techniques, the
two-bottle preference (TBP) and conditioned taste aversion (CTA), to study the
taste of the compounds used in the previous electrophysiological study. The
results showed that compounds that did not stimulate any taste fibers were
neither preferred nor rejected. Compounds that activated only S fibers were
always preferred over water. When aversion to sucrose was created by the CTA
method, these compounds were rejected. Compounds that activated Q fibers were
rejected and consumed less than water. We studied the relationship between intake
and net response from S and Q fibers in the CT and NG nerves. Intake was measured
as a preference ratio in TBP test. The net response was defined as: (S(CT) +
S(NG)) - (Q(CT) + Q(NG)), where S(CT) + S(NG) denotes the sum of the responses in
S fibers of the CT and NG nerves. Similarly, Q(CT) + Q(NG) represents the sum of 
the responses in Q fibers of the CT and NG nerves. The relationship between
intake and the Net response was linear with a Pearson correlation coefficient
0.85. This study supports our hypothesis that intake is influenced by S and Q
fibers, where S fibers serve as a hedonically positive input and Q fibers as a
hedonically negative input.

Cytologic assessment of the vaginal epithelium in the common marmoset (Callithrix
jacchus): a preliminary new approach to reproductive screening.

The application of vaginal cytology in defining reproductive events is a widely
accepted and applied diagnostic tool in many species. Here we present a
preliminary approach to recognizing a correlation between changes in vaginal
epithelial cytology and circulating plasma progesterone in the common marmoset,
Callithrix jacchus, such that vaginal cytology could be diagnostically
appropriate for reproductive management. We assessed six captive-born adult
female common marmosets for the duration of one complete estrus cycle. Cytologic 
samples, collected by vaginal swab, and blood for plasma progesterone
concentration were collected twice weekly. Cytologic samples were blindly
assessed, and vaginal epithelial maturation was defined on the basis of the
karyopyknotic index (KPI). In the three consistently cycling females (cj0328,
cj0732, and cj0678), a marked increase in KPI corresponded with rising plasma
progesterone levels, which subsequently decreased throughout the duration of
follicular phase. The remaining three females who had previously irregular estrus
cycles (cj0608, cj0680, cj0724) demonstrated irregularity in their progesterone
profiles which correlated with inconsistent KPIs. Although KPI is not a very
sensitive single sampling indicator of ovulation, evaluating changes in cytologic
morphology over time aid in predicting the timing of an ovulatory event. Our
results suggest that vaginal cytology can be an effective alternative to blood
sampling for reproductive management of the common marmoset.

The CAmbridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) is a
computerised battery of neuropsychological tests presented as stimuli on a
touch-sensitive computer screen that has been used to assess a wide range of
cognitive functions in neuropsychiatric patients, healthy volunteers, and species
of non-human primate, primarily the rhesus macaque. The common marmoset is a
small-bodied, tractable simian primate that breeds well under laboratory
conditions. This primate has been quite extensively studied in terms of its
abilities and limitations with respect to appetitive cognitive conditioning.
However, the CANTAB versions of sustained/divided attention and working memory
tasks have to-date not been studied in the marmoset. Here we describe adult
marmoset performance on the CANTAB five-choice serial reaction time task, a
delayed match-to-position task, and a task derived from the CANTAB visuo-spatial 
paired associates learning task that constituted two, concurrent delayed
match-to-position tasks. The acquisition and stable longitudinal performance of
these tasks provide strong evidence that the marmoset, in addition to the
macaque, can be the species of choice for CANTAB-based drug and lesion studies of
cognitive function, using tasks similar to those deployed in the study of human
cognition and diagnosis of neuropsychiatric disorders.

Research was conducted in sheep to determine an effective preparation method for 
high-purity sorting of frozen-thawed spermatozoa. The efficacy of sorting
frozen-thawed spermatozoa was then investigated in several non-human primate
species. An aliquot of each ejaculate (three rams, three ejaculates per ram) was 
processed as a fresh control (FRESH). Frozen spermatozoa were thawed and prepared
for sorting by no further processing (FT-NEAT), washing (FT-WASH) or gradient
centrifugation (FT-GRADIENT) and evaluated for motility at 1 h post-staining and 
motility and acrosomal status at 0 and 4 h post-sorting. Samples were analysed
using a high-speed cell sorter. High levels of purity for X- and Y-enriched
samples were achieved for all treatments (85-92%). The percentage of motile
spermatozoa before sorting was lower (P < 0.05) for frozen-thawed samples
(FT-NEAT: 32.7 +/- 2.5%; FT-WASH: 32.2 +/- 3.3%; FT-GRADIENT: 73.9 +/- 3.7%)
compared with FRESH (83.3 +/- 1.2%). Post-sorting, the percentage of motile
spermatozoa before and after incubation for FT-NEAT (60.0 +/- 5.1% and 27.2 +/-
6.1% for 0 and 4 h, respectively) was lower than that for FRESH (87.8 +/- 0.9%
and 83.3 +/- 1.2% for 0 and 4 h, respectively; P < 0.05), FT-WASH (80.0 +/- 2.4% 
and 71.7 +/- 3.6% for 0 and 4 h, respectively; P < 0.05) and FT-GRADIENT (84.4
+/- 1.3% and 77.2 +/- 1.7% for 0 and 4 h, respectively; P < 0.05). Vanguard sperm
migration distance through artificial cervical mucus was lower (P < 0.05) for
FT-NEAT (17.7 +/- 1.7 mm) compared with FT-WASH (29.1 +/- 3.8 mm) and FT-GRADIENT
(28.4 +/- 2.0 mm) and similar (P < 0.05) to FRESH (23.7 +/- 1.8 mm). Sample
preparation using a modified wash method enabled high-purity sorting (range
86-97% purity) of frozen-thawed epididymal spermatozoa in the baboon (Papio
hamadryas), common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) and common chimpanzee (Pan
troglodytes). For all non-human primate species, sorted spermatozoa were
progressively motile (marmoset: 20.5 +/- 5.5%; baboon: 37.5 +/- 2.5%; chimpanzee:
73.0 +/- 2.0%), acrosome intact (marmoset: 68.5 +/- 7.5%; baboon: 89.5 +/- 1.5%; 
chimpanzee: 84.0 +/- 1.0%) and able to penetrate an artificial cervical mucus. In
summary, high-purity sorting of frozen-thawed ram and non-human primate
spermatozoa with recovery of progressively motile, acrosome-intact spermatozoa
was possible after processing to remove cryodiluent.

Relations among birth condition, maternal condition, and postnatal growth in
captive common marmoset monkeys (Callithrix jacchus).

USA. stardif@icarus.sfbr.org

The present study characterizes the relations among maternal condition, litter
size, birth condition, and growth in body weight for a population of common
marmosets. The subjects of the study were marmosets born into a single colony
between 1994 and 2001. Three sets of analyses were conducted to answer the
following questions: 1) Is there a relationship between litter size, maternal
condition, and birth condition? In the study population, maternal body weight,
maternal age, litter size, and birth condition were related in a complex fashion.
Birth weight and prenatal long-bone growth, as reflected in knee-heel length,
were both related to maternal age, with older mothers supporting higher prenatal 
growth. Age and maternal condition appeared to interact as determinants of
long-bone growth, as the combination of older and larger mothers resulted in
significantly longer knee-heel lengths in their offspring. 2) Is there a
relationship between birth condition or maternal condition and subsequent growth 
or final adult size? The early growth rate in this population was similar to
early growth rates reported for three different marmoset colonies, suggesting
that early growth may be relatively inflexible in this species. However, within
this population, the variation that did occur in early growth rate was related to
birth weight and maternal weight. Later growth and adult weight were related to
birth weight and litter size: small twin infants displayed slower later growth
rates and were smaller as adults than twins that began life at a higher birth
weight, while the birth weight of triplets was not related to adult size. In
these marmosets, small infants that were the result of increased litter size
differed from small infants whose small birth size resulted from other factors.
This reinforces the proposal that the causes of low birth weight will be relevant
to the development of the marmoset as a model of prenatal environmental effects.

Chorionic gonadotrophin beta subunit mRNA but not luteinising hormone beta
subunit mRNA is expressed in the pituitary of the common marmoset (Callithrix
jacchus).

The pituitary gonadotrophins LH and FSH are responsible for regulation of
gametogenesis in the testis and ovary. Chorionic gonadotrophin (CG), a third
closely related glycoprotein hormone derived by gene duplication of the LHbeta
gene and secreted by the placenta in primates, is essential for the rescue of the
corpus luteum and maintenance of pregnancy. We have recently shown that marmoset 
(m) CGbeta mRNA is highly expressed in the pituitary of the common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus) and that LH is less active than human CG in activating the
human LH receptor lacking exon 10. To investigate further which gonadotrophin is 
the actual ligand of the LH receptor (LHR) of the marmoset monkey that naturally 
lacks exon 10, we identified and characterised the genomic organisation of the
mLHbeta gene and its expression. Intergenic PCR amplification of the region
encompassing the mLHbeta and the mCGbeta genes revealed that, surprisingly,
mCGbeta is located 20 kbp upstream of the LHbeta gene, whereas in other species
the intergenic distance is approximately 2-3 kbp. Sequence analysis of the
mLHbeta coding region showed 70% identity to mCGbeta and 90% identity to human
LHbeta at the amino acid level. Both gonadotrophin beta subunits are present at
the genomic level, but RT-PCR of pituitary and placental total RNA using specific
oligonucleotides for mCGbeta and mLHbeta showed high expression of mCGbeta mRNA
in both tissues, whereas LHbeta was expressed neither in the pituitary nor in the
placenta. Thus mLHbeta mRNA is lacking in the marmoset pituitary.
Immunohistochemistry of marmoset pituitaries showed that mCG was confined to the 
gonadotrophes, and partly co-localised in cells stained positively for FSH.
Western blot analysis confirmed the presence of mCG in the pituitary. Northern
blot analysis using mCGbeta as a probe displayed one transcript of 0.7 kb in the 
pituitary and detected two transcripts of 1.1 kb and 2 kb in the marmoset
placenta. Our results suggest that, in the common marmoset, CG is the only
gonadotrophin with luteinising function that is present in the pituitary. We
postulate that, owing to an unknown mutational event in evolution, expression of 
mLH was completely abolished, and CG - which, unlike LH, acts normally even when 
exon 10 is missing from the LHR - took over its function.

GB virus B (GBV-B), a flavivirus closely related to HCV, has previously been
shown to infect and replicate to high titers in tamarins (Saguinus sp.). This
study describes the use of GBV-B infection and replication in the common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus) for the successful development and validation of a surrogate
animal model for hepatitis C virus (HCV). Infection of marmosets with GBV-B
produced a viremia that peaked at 10(8) to 10(9) genome copies/ml for a period of
40 to 60 days followed by viral clearance at 60 to 80 days postinfection. Passage
of the initial tamarin-derived GBV-B in marmosets produced an infectious stock
that gave a more reproducible and consistent infection in the marmoset. Titration
of the virus stocks in vivo indicated that they contained 1 infectious unit for
every 1,000 genome copies. Cultures of primary marmoset hepatocytes were also
successfully infected with GBV-B, with high levels of virus detected in
supernatants and cells for up to 14 days postinfection. Treatment of
GBV-B-infected hepatocyte cultures with a novel class of HCV protease inhibitor
(pyrrolidine 5,5 trans-lactams) reduced viral levels by more than 2 logs.
Treatment of GBV-B-infected marmosets with one such inhibitor resulted in a 3-log
drop in serum viral titer over 4 days of therapy. These studies provide the first
demonstration of the in vivo efficacy of a small-molecule inhibitor for HCV in an
animal model and illustrate the utility of GBV-B as a surrogate animal model
system for HCV.

Distribution of protein gene product 9.5-immunopositive and
NADPH-diaphorase-positive neurons in the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus)
accessory olfactory bulb.

Author information:

The principal center of the accessory olfactory system is the accessory olfactory
bulb (AOB). In primates, simians are divided into two groups, New and Old World
monkeys, and the AOB is present in only New World monkeys. The common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus) is a species of New World monkey. Although the morphology of
the common marmoset AOB has been demonstrated, the distribution patterns of the
mitral/tufted and granule cells of the AOB remain unclear. In the present study, 
therefore, the distribution of the mitral/tufted and granule cells in the common 
marmoset AOB was examined using two histochemical markers including
immuno-staining for protein gene product (PGP) 9.5 and NADPH-diaphorase staining.
The vomeronasal nerves, gomeruli and mitral/tufted cells showed PGP
9.5-immunoreactivity. The mitral/tufted cells were arranged in only one or two
rows along the margin of the glomerular layer to form the mitral/tufted cell
layer (MTL). Since the mitral/tufted cells occurred sparsely in the common
marmoset, the MTL was illegible. NADPH-diaphorase reactivity was primarily
detected in the rostral and caudal areas of the AOB. In these areas, granule
cells showed NADPH-diaphorase reactivity. Since the granule cells were sparse,
the common marmoset AOB displayed less-developed granule cell layer. Although the
functional significance of the AOB remains to be solved in the common marmoset,
small-sized and less-laminated AOB may show that sexual behavior of the common
marmoset has lesser dependence on the accessory olfactory system.

The present study describes the distribution of tyrosine hydroxylase
(TH)-immunoreactive (IR) elements in the olfactory bulb of the common marmoset
monkey (Callithrix jacchus), a primate species by immunohistochemistry. We
identified six layers of the olfactory bulb of the common marmoset monkey in
sections stained with cresyl violet. The majority of TH-IR cells were found in
the glomerular layer. A few TH-IR cells were present in the external plexiform
and granule cell layers. TH-IR fibers were identified in all layers of the
olfactory bulb. The density of these nerve fibers was high in the internal
plexiform and granule cell layers. The results in the olfactory bulb of the
common marmoset monkey are generally similar to previous reports in some mammals.
These data suggest that TH in the olfactory bulb of the common marmoset monkey
may play a role in olfactory transmission via the glomeruli like in other
mammals.

The purpose of the present set of studies was to develop a new primate model of
focal ischemia with reperfusion for long-term functional assessment in the common
marmoset. Initially, the cerebral vascular anatomy of the marmoset was
interrogated by Araldite-cast and ink-perfusion methods to determine the
feasibility of an intravascular surgical approach. The methods showed that the
internal carotid artery was highly tortuous in its passage, precluding the
development of an extracranial method of inducing temporary middle cerebral
artery occlusion in the marmoset. A pilot dose-response study investigated an
intracranial approach of topically applying endothelin-1 (ET-1) to the M2 portion
of the middle cerebral artery in a small sample of marmosets for up to 6 hours (n
= 2 or 3 per group). Dose-dependent reductions in middle cerebral artery vessel
caliber followed by gradual reperfusion were inversely related to increases in
corrected lesion volume after ET-1 treatment, relative to vehicle control
application. Finally, the functional consequences of ET-1-induced lesions to the 
M2 vascular territory were assessed up to 24 hours after surgery using the
optimal dose established in the pilot study (2.5 nmol/25 microL). ET-1-treated
marmosets (n = 4) showed marked contralateral motor deficits in grip strength and
retrieval of food rewards and contralateral sensory/motor neglect towards tactile
stimulation, relative to their ipsilateral side and vehicle-treated marmosets (n 
= 4). Strong correlations were shown between contralateral impairments and
histopathologic parameters, which revealed unilateral putamen and cortical damage
to the middle cerebral artery territory. No deficits were shown on general
mobility, and self-care was promptly resumed in ET-1 marmosets after surgery.
These results show that this novel model of ischemia with reperfusion in the
marmoset has the potential to assess long-term function and to gauge the efficacy
of novel therapeutic strategies targeted for clinical stroke.

Lesions of the orbitofrontal but not medial prefrontal cortex disrupt conditioned
reinforcement in primates.

Pears A(1), Parkinson JA, Hopewell L, Everitt BJ, Roberts AC.

Author information:

Kingdom.

The ventromedial prefrontal cortex (PFC) is implicated in affective and motivated
behaviors. Damage to this region, which includes the orbitofrontal cortex as well
as ventral sectors of medial PFC, causes profound changes in emotional and social
behavior, including impairments in certain aspects of decision making. One
reinforcement mechanism that may well contribute to these behaviors is
conditioned reinforcement, whereby previously neutral stimuli in the environment,
by virtue of their association with primary rewards, take on reinforcing value
and come to support instrumental action. Conditioned reinforcers are powerful
determinants of behavior and can maintain responding over protracted periods of
time in the absence of and potentially in conflict with primary reinforcers. It
has already been shown that conditioned reinforcement is dependent on the
amygdala, and because the amygdala projects to both the orbitofrontal cortex and 
the medial PFC, the present study determined whether conditioned reinforcement
was also dependent on one or the other of these prefrontal regions. Comparison of
the behavioral effects of selective excitotoxic lesions of the PFC in the common 
marmoset revealed that orbitofrontal but not medial PFC lesions disrupted two
distinct measures of conditioned reinforcement: (1) acquisition of a new response
and (2) sensitivity to conditioned stimulus omission on a second-order schedule. 
In contrast, the orbitofrontal lesion did not affect sensitivity to primary
reinforcement as measured by responding on a progressive-ratio schedule and a
home cage consumption test. Together, these findings demonstrate the critical and
specific involvement of the orbitofrontal cortex but not the medial PFC in
conditioned reinforcement.

Ultrastructural evidence of brain mast cell activation without degranulation in
monkey experimental allergic encephalomyelitis.

Avenue, Boston, MA 02111, USA.

Experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) is an animal model for the human
demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis (MS). Increased permeability of the
blood-brain barrier (BBB) precedes the development of clinical or pathologic
findings in MS and may be induced by perivascular brain mast cells secreting
vasoactive and proinflammatory molecules. Brain mast cells were investigated
ultrastructurally in acute EAE of the non-human primate common marmoset
Callithrix jacchus, which develops a mild neurologic relapsing-remitting course. 
Control diencephalic samples contained perivascular mast cells with mostly intact
electron dense granules. In contrast, EAE samples had marked demyelination and
mast cells with numerous altered secretory granules; their electron dense content
varied in amount and texture with a "honeycomb" or "target" appearance, but
without degranulation. These changes were evident even before the development of 
any clinical symptoms and suggest that brain mast cells may be involved in EAE,
and possibly MS, through a unique process that may involve selective secretion of
molecules able to disrupt the BBB.

complementary stripe-like locations were visually stimulated in turn. Their
difference depicts the cortical representations of continuous bands of visual
space. By rotating the sets of stripe-like locations it is possible to map
different spatial axes. Analogous to the macaque we found that the V1/V2 border
represented the vertical meridian, while horizontal, 45-, and 135-degree angled
stripes of space were also represented in a continuous manner. We developed a new
automatic method of calculating local measures of cortical magnification from our
optical retinotopic maps. Using this method we found no evidence of any local
anisotropies in cortical representation. Overall our results indicate that space 
is mapped isotropically in the primary visual cortex of the common marmoset.

Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) has shown potential as a
treatment for Parkinson's disease. Recombinant adeno-associated viral vectors
expressing the GDNF protein (rAAV-GDNF) have been used in rodent models of
Parkinson's disease to promote functional regeneration after 6-OHDA lesions of
the nigrostriatal system. The goal of the present study was to assess the
anatomical and functional efficacy of rAAV-GDNF in the common marmoset monkey
(Callithrix jacchus). rAAV-GDNF was injected into the striatum and substantia
nigra 4 weeks prior to a unilateral 6-OHDA lesion of the nigrostriatal bundle.
Forty percent of the dopamine cells in the lesioned substantia nigra of the
rAAV-GDNF-treated monkeys survived, compared with 21% in the untreated monkeys.
Fine dopaminergic fibres were observed microscopically in the injected striatum
of some rAAV-GDNF-treated monkeys, suggesting that rAAV-GDNF treatment may have
prevented, at least in part, the loss of dopaminergic innervation of the
striatum. Protection of dopamine cells and striatal fibre innervation was
associated with amelioration of the lesion-induced behavioural deficits.
rAAV-GDNF-treated monkeys showed partial or complete protection not only in the
amphetamine and apomorphine rotation but also in head position and the
parkinsonian disability rating scale. Therefore, our study provides evidence for 
the behavioural and anatomical efficacy of GDNF delivered via an rAAV vector as a
possible treatment for Parkinson's disease.

Using positive reinforcement, J. McKinley trained 12 common marmosets (Callithrix
jacchus) to provide urine samples on request. The study then exposed the
marmosets to mildly stressful, routine husbandry procedures (i.e., capture and
weighing). The nonhuman animals spent less time inactive poststressor as opposed 
to prestressor. L. Bassett collected matched behavioral data from 12 nontrained
marmosets who were less accustomed to human interaction. These animals spent
significantly more time self-scratching and locomoting as well as less time
inactive, poststressor. Collapsed data from the 2 populations showed increased
scent marking, poststressor. These results suggest that locomotion,
self-scratching, and scent marking are useful, noninvasive behavioral measures of
stress and, thus, reduced welfare in the common marmoset. Overall, nontrained
animals showed more self-scratching than did their trained counterparts. It was
not possible to collect urine from nontrained marmosets. In response to the
stressor, however, trained animals showed no significant change in excreted
urinary cortisol. These results suggest that training marmosets may allow them to
cope better with routine laboratory procedures.

Social suppression of cortisol in female marmoset monkeys: role of circulating
ACTH levels and glucocorticoid negative feedback.

Behaviorally subordinate female common marmoset monkeys (Callithrix jacchus)
exhibit pronounced, chronic reductions of circulating cortisol levels. Cortisol
suppression in these animals is mediated in part by adrenocortical
hyporesponsiveness to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). In addition, we
hypothesized that social subordination may activate a central, neurally mediated 
mechanism to further inhibit hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal function. In this
study, therefore, we evaluated basal plasma cortisol and ACTH concentrations, as 
well as cortisol and ACTH responses to dexamethasone (DEX), in dominant and
subordinate females to initially characterize such a mechanism. Morning plasma
cortisol and ACTH levels were determined before, and 1, 2, and 3 days following
administration of DEX (0.5, 1.0, or 5.0 mg/kg, IM) or saline. Baseline cortisol
concentrations prior to DEX treatment were significantly lower in subordinate
females than in dominants, as previously reported. However, ACTH concentrations
in the same blood samples did not differ between the two groups. Furthermore,
dominant and subordinate females showed similar cortisol and ACTH responses to
DEX. These results indicate that reduced circulating cortisol levels in
subordinate females are not associated with either altered circulating ACTH
concentrations or enhanced responsiveness to glucocorticoid negative feedback.
However, the finding that basal ACTH levels are not elevated in subordinate
females as compared to dominants, in spite of low circulating cortisol
concentrations, suggests that ACTH secretion in subordinate females is restrained
by a steroid-independent inhibitory mechanism operating at the level of the brain
or pituitary.

    Exp Neurol. 2003 Oct;183(2):258-62.

Animal studies investigating the efficacy of neurotrophic factors as treatments
for Parkinson's disease (PD) ideally require partial dopamine (DA) lesion models.
The intrastriatal 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesion model may be suitable for
this purpose. Although this model has been well characterized in rodents, it has 
not previously been used in monkeys. The goal of the present study was to
characterize the behavioral effects of unilateral injections of 6-OHDA in the
basal ganglia of common marmoset monkeys (Callithrix jacchus). Cell counts from
tyrosine hydroxylase immunochemistry 5 months postlesion revealed DA cell loss in
the substantia nigra on the lesioned side to approximately 46% of relative to the
unlesioned side. 6-OHDA lesioned monkeys showed a variety of behavioral deficits.
Apomorphine induced rotation and simple sensorimotor measures (head position bias
and PD disability rating score) were most affected by the lesion. The largest
deficits were seen at 1 or 2 weeks postsurgery but had recovered by week 10.
6-OHDA lesioned monkeys took longer to complete a more complex sensorimotor
staircase task. At 3.5 months postlesion, 6-OHDA monkeys also showed deficits on 
an object retrieval task designed to measure sensorimotor planning and skilled
hand use. alpha-Methyl-p-tyrosine, a tyrosine hydroxylase inhibitor, reinstated
those deficits which had undergone recovery in the lesioned animals and also
exacerbated the deficits on the staircase task. This model has potential in
assessing treatments for PD aimed at curtailing disease progression such as
continuous delivery of neurotrophic factors.

Drive, Southborough, Massachusetts 01772, USA.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a small, nonendangered New World
primate that is native to Brazil and has been used extensively in biomedical
research. Historically the common marmoset has been used in neuroscience,
reproductive biology, infectious disease, and behavioral research. Recently, the 
species has been used increasingly in drug development and safety assessment.
Advantages relate to size, cost, husbandry, and biosafety issues as well as
unique physiologic differences that may be used in model development.
Availability and ease of breeding in captivity suggest that they may represent an
alternative species to more traditional nonhuman primates. The marmoset models
commonly used in biomedical research are presented, with emphasis on those that
may provide an alternative to traditional nonhuman primate species.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a small New World primate that is
native to eastern Brazil and has been used in biomedical research since the early
1960s. Use of this species for research purposes continues to grow at a rapid
pace as they are a viable alternative to other nonhuman primate species. We
discuss clinical care, such as preventative medicine, anesthesia, and routine
clinical procedures. Important viral, bacterial, parasitic, and gastrointestinal 
tract diseases are discussed, with relevant details on cause, transmission,
pathologic changes, diagnosis, and treatment. Current problems affecting marmoset
health and research in the modern vivarium are emphasized.

Antonio, Texas 78245-0549, USA.

Though sexual maturation may begin at around one year of age, first successful
reproduction of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is likely to be later,
and it is generally recommended that animals not be mated before 1.5 years of
age. The average gestation period is estimated to be 143 to 144 days. A
crown-rump length measurement taken by use of ultrasonography during the linear, 
rapid, prenatal growth phase (between approx. days 60 and 95) can be compared
against standard growth curves to estimate delivery date to within 3 to 4 days,
on average. Marmosets produce more young per delivery than does any other
anthropoid primate, and have more variation in litter size. Many long-established
colonies report that triplets are the most common litter size, and there is
documented association between higher maternal body weight and higher ovulation
numbers. Higher litter sizes generally do not generate higher numbers of viable
young. Marmosets are unusual among primates in having a postpartum ovulation that
typically results in conception and successful delivery; reported median
inter-birth intervals range from 154 to 162 days. However, pregnancy losses are
quite common; one study of a large breeding colony indicated 50 percent loss
between conception and term delivery. The average life span for breeding females 
is around six years; the range of reported average lifetime number of litters for
a breeding pair is 3.45 to 4.0. Our purpose is to provide an overview of
reproduction in the common marmoset, including basic reproductive life history,
lactation and weaning, social housing requirements, and common problems
encountered in the captive breeding of this species. A brief comparison between
marmoset and tamarin reproduction also will be provided.

Capitol Court, Madison, Wisconsin 53715-1299, USA.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a small-bodied, adaptable New World
primate from secondary forests in Brazil that is used in various types of
research, such as reproductive biology, neuroendocrinology, behavioral research, 
neuroscience, infectious disease, and drug development. Because of their small
body size, adaptability to a variety of conditions, unique physiologic
characteristics, family social structure, and calm demeanor, they have become the
primate of choice for certain research areas. However, because of their small
body size, the amount and type of samples that can be obtained from them can
prove to be challenging. The objective of the study reported here is to review
some techniques developed for obtaining samples or data from marmoset monkeys in 
a variety of research settings and includes restraint methods that work well for 
the type of sample collection required.

While common marmosets are increasingly used as alternative primate models in
biomedical research, their life history, specialized behavior and unique
physiology are not well known. This paper describes important marmoset attributes
that are particularly relevant for biomedical research, including reproduction,
neurobiology, immunology, endocrine signaling, obesity and aging, in addition to 
fetal and postnatal development. While common marmosets exhibit characteristic
anthropoid primate traits, they clearly differ from Old World primates and humans
in a variety of functions, including reproduction, endocrine signaling and
immunology. These differences, however, permit the use of common marmosets in
unconventional research strategies targeted on human pathology.

Glutamate receptors at bipolar synapses in the inner plexiform layer of primate
retina: light microscopic analysis.

University of Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia. ugrunert@optometry.unimelb.edu.au

At least 10 different types of bipolar cells have been distinguished in the
primate retina. The axon terminals of these cells stratify in distinct strata in 
the inner plexiform layer and are involved in parallel pathways to distinct types
of ganglion cells. Ionotropic glutamate receptor (GluR) subunits also show a
stratified distribution in the inner plexiform layer. Here, we investigated
whether different types of bipolar cells are associated with different types of
ionotropic glutamate receptors in the inner retina of a New World primate, the
common marmoset Callithrix jacchus. Vertical cryostat sections through central
retina were double labeled with immunohistochemical markers for bipolar cell
types and with antibodies to alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate
(AMPA) receptor subunits GluR1 to 4, kainate receptor subunits GluR6/7, and the
NR1C2' subunit of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. The axon terminals of
bipolar cell types were reconstructed from confocal sections, and the colocalized
immunoreactive puncta were quantified. For all bipolar cell types, immunoreactive
puncta for the AMPA receptor subunits GluR2, 2/3, and 4 were colocalized at
highest densities, whereas GluR1-immunoreactive puncta were expressed at very low
densities. The kainate receptor subunits GluR6/7 were predominantly associated
with diffuse bipolar (DB6) and rod bipolar cells. The NMDA receptor subunit
NR1C2' was specifically colocalized with flat midget and DB3 axons. These
findings suggest that rod and cone bipolar cell types contribute to multiple but 
distinct glutamate receptor pathways in primate retina.

Evolutionary implications of the unusual walking mechanics of the common marmoset
(C. jacchus).

Schmitt D(1).

Center, Durham, North Carolina 27710, USA. Daniel_Schmitt@baa.mc.duke.edu

Several features that appear to differentiate the walking gaits of most primates 
from those of most other mammals (the prevalence of diagonal-sequence footfalls, 
high degrees of humeral protraction, and low forelimb vs. hindlimb peak vertical 
forces) are believed to have evolved in response to requirements of locomotion on
thin arboreal supports by early primates that had developed clawless grasping
hands and feet. This putative relationship between anatomy, behavior, and ecology
is tested here by examining gait mechanics in the common marmoset (Callithrix
jacchus), a primate that has sharp claws and reduced pedal grasping, and that
spends much of its time clinging on large trunks. Kinematic and kinetic data were
collected on three male Callithrix jacchus as they walked across a force platform
attached to the ground or to raised horizontal poles. The vast majority of all
walking gaits were lateral-sequence. For all steps, the humerus was retracted
(<90 degrees relative to a horizontal axis) or held in a neutral (90 degrees )
position at forelimb touchdown. Peak vertical forces on the forelimb were always 
higher than those on the hindlimb. These three features of the walking gaits of
C. jacchus separate it from any other primate studied (including other
callitrichids). The walking gaits of C. jacchus are mechanically more similar to 
those of small, nonprimate mammals. The results of this study support previous
models that suggest that the unusual suite of features that typify the walking
gaits of most primates are adaptations to the requirements of locomotion on thin 
arboreal supports. These data, along with data from other primates and
marsupials, suggest that primate postcranial and locomotor characteristics are
part of a basal adaptation for walking on thin branches.

The common marmoset Callithrix jacchus is a primate phylogenetically close to
humans which, when immunized with myelin proteins, is susceptible to a form of
experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) that resembles multiple sclerosis
(MS). Neuropathological features of marmoset EAE, including inflammation,
demyelination and axonal injury, are strikingly similar to findings in the human 
disease and are the final result of a joint autoimmune attack by myelin-specific 
T and B cells. The molecular and functional similarity of the marmoset immune
system, together with the availability of diagnostic tools that can be used in
humans (such as magnetic resonance imaging), makes the marmoset EAE a unique
model with which to evaluate the safety and efficacy of therapeutic strategies
for the treatment of MS.

The recent finding of a novel Epstein-Barr virus-related lymphocryptovirus
(CalHV-3) in a captive colony of common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) in the
United States modifies the view that the host range of lymphocryptovirus is
restricted to humans and Old World primates. We investigated the presence of
Epstein-Barr virus-related viruses in 79 samples of New World monkeys caught in
the wild, including six species of the Cebidae family and one of the
Callitrichidae, living in the rain forest of French Guiana. Using a degenerate
consensus PCR method for the herpesvirus DNA polymerase gene, we identified three
novel lymphocryptoviruses from golden-handed tamarin (Saguinus midas) of the
Callitrichidae family and squirrel monkey (Saimiri sciureus) and white-faced saki
(Pithecia pithecia) of the Cebidae family. With the CalHV-3 strain, these three
novel viruses constitute a well-supported phylogenetic clade in the
Lymphocryptovirus genus, which is clearly distinct from the lineage of Old World 
lymphocryptovirus, hosted by catarrhine monkeys and humans. In tamarins, the
prevalence of the novel lymphocryptovirus was more than 50%, indicating that it
circulates well in the wild population, perhaps due to specific ecoethological
patterns such as confrontations and intergroup migration. The detection and
partial molecular characterization of the polymerase gene of three novel
Gamma-1-Herpesvirinae from New World monkeys caught in the wild clearly indicate 
that free-ranging populations of platyrrhine are natural hosts of
lymphocryptoviruses. Further characterization of these novel viruses will provide
new insight not only into the origin and evolution of Gammaherpesvirinae but also
into their pathogenicity.

The owl monkey (Aotus trivirgatus) has served as the standard non-human primate
model of herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) infection because it is highly
susceptible to HSV-1 encephalitis. Owl monkeys, however, are expensive, difficult
to obtain, and difficult to maintain in captivity, thus greatly hampering the
efficiency of preclinical gene therapy trials for brain tumors using HSV-1-based 
vectors. We have therefore compared the susceptibility of the common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus) with the owl monkey in a model of intracerebral inoculation 
of wildtype HSV-1 F-strain at increasing titers. The common marmosets
consistently succumbed earlier to viral encephalitis than the owl monkeys. The
histological evaluation of the common marmoset revealed extensive HSV-1 infection
with a concomitant yet less marked inflammatory response compared to the owl
monkeys. PCR for HSV-1 demonstrated a similar extra-CNS shedding route in both
experimental models. Our findings show that the common marmoset is at least as
susceptible to intracerebral HSV-infection as the owl monkey and that it can
therefore serve as a valid and reliable experimental model for the important
preclinical safety tests of HSV-based therapeutic viral vector constructs in the 
brain.

The authors explored whether prolactin is associated with paternal care in 3
monkey species: titi monkey (Callicebus cupreus), common marmoset (Callithrix
jacchus), and Goeldi's monkey (Callimico goeldii). They compared prolactin levels
in fathers before and after infant birth as well as between fathers and
nonfathers. C. cupreus fathers carry infants almost exclusively, have higher
prolactin levels than nonfathers, but show no prolactin increase after infant
birth. C. goeldii fathers carry infants only after 3 weeks, show an increase in
prolactin levels during the precarrying period, but do not have higher levels
than nonfathers. C jacchus fathers are the primary carriers, have higher
prolactin levels than nonfathers, and show a trend for a prolactin increase after
the birth of infants. In conclusion, species differences in the patterns of
prolactin secretion were evident and reflect the different paternal roles.

Selective age-related loss of calbindin-D28k from basal forebrain cholinergic
neurons in the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).

A significant number of the cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain of the
primate, but not the rodent brain contain the calcium binding protein
calbindin-D28k (CB). Previous experiments in our laboratory have demonstrated a
substantial age-related loss of CB from the human basal forebrain cholinergic
neurons (BFCN). The present study investigated the possible age-related loss of
CB from the BFCN in a non-human primate species, the common marmoset (Callithrix 
jacchus). Quantitative analysis of matching sections as well as unbiased
stereological determination of neuronal number were used in 16 adult marmosets
ranging in age between 2 and 15 years. No significant changes were observed in
the number of choline acetyltransferase-positive BFCN when a group of young
animals (< or =4 years) was compared with a 6-8-year-old group and a
9-15-year-old group. Similarly, no age-related changes were observed in
Nissl-stained magnocellular basal forebrain (putatively cholinergic) neurons. In 
contrast, the BFCN of the two older groups of animals displayed a significant
loss of CB. The age-related loss of CB occurred in all sectors of the BFCN, but
was greatest in the anterior sector of this cell group. The CB loss was
neurochemically specific since the BFCN in the older groups of animals continued 
to express other markers such as high and low affinity neurotrophin receptors.
The age-related loss of CB from the marmoset BFCN was also regionally selective
as CB positive neurons in other structures, such as the cerebral cortex and the
striatum displayed no apparent age-related changes. These results indicate that
the marmoset BFCN display a significant and selective age-related loss of CB
reminiscent of that observed in the human. Therefore, the common marmoset
represents an appropriate animal model in which the consequences of BFCN CB loss 
can be investigated in depth. Loss of CB from the aged BFCN is likely to reduce
the capacity of these neurons to buffer intracellular calcium and to leave them
vulnerable to insults which can result in increased calcium levels. The
vulnerability of the CB-negative BFCN in the aged marmoset to various insults
which disturb calcium homeostasis remains to be investigated.

GBV-B virus is a close relative to hepatitis C virus (HCV) that causes hepatitis 
in tamarins, and thus, is an attractive surrogate model for HCV. In this study,
we demonstrate that the host range of GBV-B extends to the common marmoset with
an infection profile similar to that observed for tamarins. Marmoset hepatocytes 
were susceptible to in vitro infection with GBV-B. Virus was efficiently secreted
into the medium, and approximately 25% of hepatocytes were positive for NS3
staining. In an attempt to induce persistent infections, tamarins were
immunosuppressed with FK506 and inoculated with GBV-B. Although no chronic
infections were induced, the duration of viremia was increased in most animals.
In one animal, the duration of viremia was extended to 46 weeks, but viral
clearance occurred 18 weeks after stopping FK506 therapy. The greater
availability of marmosets in comparison to tamarins will greatly facilitate
future research efforts with this model.

Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) spectroscopy in combination with
pattern recognition techniques were used to investigate the composition of
organic compounds in urines from patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), patients 
with other neurological diseases (OND) and healthy controls (H). Using a valid
animal model of MS, namely the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) model of
experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the relation of disease
progression and alteration of the urine composition was investigated. Urine
samples were collected during different stages of EAE, either induced with whole 
human myelin or with the myelin protein MOG in complete adjuvant. The urine
samples were analysed with 1H-NMR spectroscopy allowing simultaneous detection of
an array of compounds. Spectral differences between urines from EAE-affected and 
healthy monkeys were assessed with multivariate analysis. Evidence is provided
that development of EAE is associated with changes in the chemical composition of
the urine, in particular of compounds with NMR peaks in the region of the
spectrum between 0.5 and 3.50 ppm. In addition, we found preliminary evidence for
differences between urines from MS, OND and H groups.

Embryonic stem cell lines of nonhuman primates.

Human embryonic stem (ES) cell lines have opened great potential and expectation 
for cell therapy and regenerative medicine. Monkey and human ES cell lines, which
are very similar to each other, have been established from monkey blastocysts and
surplus human blastocysts from fertility clinics. Nonhuman primate ES cell lines 
provide important research tools for basic and applicative research. Firstly,
they provide wider aspects of investigation of the regulative mechanisms of stem 
cells and cell differentiation among primate species. Secondly, their usage does 
not need clearance or permission from the regulative rules in many countries that
are associated with the ethical aspects of human ES cells, although human and
nonhuman embryos and fetuses are very similar to each other. Lastly and most
importantly, they are indispensable for animal models of cell therapy to test
effectiveness, safety, and immunological reaction of the allogenic
transplantation in a setting similar to the treatment of human diseases. So far, 
ES cell lines have been established from rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta), common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), and cynomolgus monkey (Macaca fascicularis), using
blastocysts produced naturally or by in vitro fertilization (IVF) and
intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). These cell lines seem to have very
similar characteristics. They express alkaline phosphatase activity and
stage-specific embryonic antigen (SSEA)-4 and, in most cases, SSEA-3. Their
pluripotency was confirmed by the formation of embryoid bodies and
differentiation into various cell types in culture and also by the formation of
teratomas that contained many types of differentiated tissues including
derivatives of three germ layers after transplantation into the severe combined
immunodeficiency (SCID) mice. The noneffectiveness of the leukemia inhibitory
factor (LIF) signal makes culture of primate and human ES cell lines prone to
undergo spontaneous differentiation and thus it is difficult to maintain these
stem cell colonies. Also, these ES cells are more susceptible to various
stresses, causing difficulty with subculturing using enzymatic treatment and
cloning from single cells. However, with various improvements in culture methods,
it is now possible to maintain stable colonies of monkey ES cells using a
serum-free medium and subculturing with trypsin treatment. Under such conditions,
cynomolgus monkey ES cell lines can be maintained in an undifferentiated state
with a normal karyotype and pluripotency even after prolonged periods of culture 
over 1 year. Such progress should facilitate many aspects of stem cell research
using both nonhuman primate and human ES cell lines.

Common marmosets are members of the family Callitrichidae, South American
primates characterized by highly social group living and cooperative breeding. In
this study we analysed 1112 base pairs (bp) of the mitochondrial control region
in 59 Callithrix jacchus individuals, sampled mainly from two geographically
distinct field sites in N.E. Brazil. Analysis of molecular variation revealed a
highly significant genetic structuring of haplotypes between social groups and
between populations. Examination of matrilineal genetic structure within social
groups revealed that seven of nine recorded breeding pairs were from different
maternal lineages, indicating assortative mating and outbreeding. In addition to 
the breeders, at least six of 10 groups contained adult individuals from
different matrilines, with five haplotypes present in one social group of nine
animals. Groups of mixed lineages raise questions about potential reproductive
conflicts of interest, and the extent of kin-selected altruism in the evolution
and maintenance of cooperative breeding in this species.

human follicle stimulating hormone.

To reduce the number of animals required for controlled studies of marmoset
oocytes and early embryos, a superovulation protocol was developed for the common
marmoset. Females were given up to 50 i.u./day recombinant human follicle
stimulating hormone (FSH)--(r-hFSH) for 6 days. Ovaries were visualized by a
modified laparoscopic technique and follicular aspiration was performed using a
needle and suction apparatus inserted directly through an otoscope speculum. The 
number of follicles + ovulation points (+/- S.E.) was 2.9 (+/- 0.2) in controls
and 14.1 (+/- 1.6; P < or = 0.001) in the 50 i.u. r-hFSH per day animals.
Oocytes, typically at the germinal vesicle stage at collection, extruded a first 
polar body within 26 hours. In vitro fertilization was performed and embryos
developed to the hatched blastocyst stage (34%). With many high quality oocytes
and the ability to synchronize cycles, the marmoset is a valuable primate model
for examining nuclear reprograming and early embryonic events.

A promoter that acquired p53 responsiveness during primate evolution.

Contente A(1), Zischler H, Einspanier A, Dobbelstein M.

Author information: 
(1)Institut für Virologie, Philipps-Universität Marburg, Germany.

The tumor suppressor p53 activates the transcription of human PIG3 through direct
interaction with a polymorphic microsatellite sequence, (TGYCC)(n). Here, the
evolution of this p53-responsive element was recapitulated. Comparison between
primate species revealed that the PIG3 promoter acquired this sequence element in
its full length only in Hominoidea (apes and humans), whereas the number of TGYCC
repeats is far lower in monkeys. Accordingly, only the PIG3 promoters from
Hominoidea respond efficiently to p53, whereas those from monkeys respond poorly 
or not at all. In parallel, the PIG3 gene was strongly induced by p53 in human
and chimpanzee cells but was unaffected by p53 in cells derived from a common
marmoset monkey. Thus, a novel p53 target gene appeared as recently as during the
evolution of primates. This suggests that mechanisms of tumor suppression are
subject to ongoing evolution in humans and their closest relatives.

Alterations in m-RNA expression for Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase and glutathione
peroxidase in the basal ganglia of MPTP-treated marmosets and patients with
Parkinson's disease.

Kunikowska G(1), Jenner P.

Author information:

School of Biomedical Sciences, King's College, London, UK.

Alterations occurring in the antioxidant enzymes, copper, zinc-dependent
superoxide dismutase (Cu,Zn-SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) following
nigral dopaminergic denervation are unclear. We now report on the distribution
and levels of m-RNA for Cu,Zn-SOD and GPX in basal ganglia of normal and
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated common marmosets, and
in normal individuals and patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) using in situ
hybridization histochemistry and oligodeoxynucleotide (single-stranded DNA)
probes. Cu,Zn-SOD and GPX m-RNA was present throughout basal ganglia (nucleus
accumbens, caudate-putamen, globus pallidus, substantia nigra) in the common
marmoset, with the highest levels being in substantia nigra (SN). Following MPTP 
induced nigral cell loss, Cu,Zn-SOD m-RNA levels were decreased in all areas but 
the SNr, and particularly in SNc (71%, P<0.001). MPTP-treatment had no effect on 
GPX m-RNA expression in any area of basal ganglia. Cu,Zn-SOD and GPX m-RNA was
also present in the normal human SN. In PD, however, Cu,Zn-SOD m-RNA was
significantly decreased (89%, P<0.005) in SNc, and there was a near-complete loss
of GPX m-RNA in both SNc (100%, P<0.005) and SNr (88%, P<0.005). The loss of
Cu,Zn-SOD m-RNA in SNc in MPTP-treated marmosets and patients with PD suggests
that it is primarily located in dopaminergic neuronal cell bodies. The loss of
GPX m-RNA in SNc in PD also suggests a localisation to dopaminergic cell bodies, 
but the similar change in SNr may indicate its presence in dopaminergic neurites.
In contrast, the absence of change in GPX m-RNA in MPTP-treated primates appears 
to rule out its presence in dopaminergic cells in this species, but this may only
be apparent and may reflect increased expression in glial cells following acute
toxin treatment.

Nonhuman primates (NHPs) have provided robust experimental animal models for many
human-related diseases due to their similar physiologies. Nonetheless, profound
differences remain in the acquisition, progression, and outcome of important
diseases such as AIDS and Alzheimer's, for which the underlying basis remains
obscure. We explored the utility of human high-density oligonucleotide arrays to 
survey the transcription profile of NHP genomes. Total RNA from prefrontal
cortices of human (Homo sapiens), common chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes),
cynomolgous macaque (Macaca fascicularis), and common marmoset (Callithrix
jacchus) was labeled and hybridized to Affymetrix U95A GeneChip probe arrays.
Corresponding data obtained previously from common chimpanzee and orangutan
(Pongo pygmaeus) were added for comparison. Qualitative (present or not detected)
and quantitative (expression level) analysis indicated that many genes known to
be involved in human neurological disorders were present and regulated in NHPs. A
gene involved in dopamine metabolism (catechol-O-methyltransferase) was absent in
macaque and marmoset. Glutamate receptor 2 was up-regulated, and
transcription-associated genes were down-regulated in NHPs compared with humans. 
We demonstrate that transcript profiling of NHPs could provide comparative
genomic data to validate and better focus experimental animal models of human
neurological disorders.

Among primate species there is pronounced variation in the relationship between
social status and measures of stress physiology. An informal meta-analysis was
designed to investigate the basis of this diversity across different primate
societies. Species were included only if a substantial amount of published
information was available regarding both social behavior and rank-related
differences in stress physiology. Four Old World and three New World species met 
these criteria, including societies varying from small-group, singular
cooperative breeders (common marmoset and cotton top tamarin) to large-troop,
multi-male, multi-female polygynous mating systems (rhesus, cynomolgus, talapoin,
squirrel monkeys, and olive baboon). A questionnaire was formulated to obtain
information necessary to characterize the stress milieu for individuals in
particular primate societies. We standardized cortisol values within each species
by calculating the ratio of basal cortisol concentrations of subordinates to
those of dominants in stable dominance hierarchies and expressing the ratio as a 
percentage (relative cortisol levels). The meta-analysis identified two variables
that significantly predicted relative cortisol levels: subordinates exhibited
higher relative cortisol levels when they (1). were subjected to higher rates of 
stressors, and (2). experienced decreased opportunities for social (including
close kin) support. These findings have important implications for understanding 
the different physiological consequences of dominant and subordinate social
status across primate societies and how social rank may differ in its behavioral 
and physiological manifestations among primate societies.

Sensory-motor interaction in the primate auditory cortex during self-initiated
vocalizations.

Eliades SJ(1), Wang X.

Author information:

Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland 21205, USA.

Little is known about sensory-motor interaction in the auditory cortex of
primates at the level of single neurons and its role in supporting vocal
communication. The present study investigated single-unit activities in the
auditory cortex of a vocal primate, the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus),
during self-initiated vocalizations. We found that 1) self-initiated
vocalizations resulted in suppression of neural discharges in a majority of
auditory cortical neurons. The vocalization-induced inhibition suppressed both
spontaneous and stimulus-driven discharges. Suppressed units responded poorly to 
external acoustic stimuli during vocalization. 2) Vocalization-induced
suppression began several hundred milliseconds prior to the onset of
vocalization. 3) The suppression of cortical discharges reduced neural firings to
below the rates expected from a unit's rate-level function, adjusted for known
subcortical attenuation, and therefore was likely not entirely caused by
subcortical attenuation mechanisms. 4) A smaller population of auditory cortical 
neurons showed increased discharges during self-initiated vocalizations. This
vocalization-related excitation began after the onset of vocalization and is
likely the result of acoustic feedback. Units showing this excitation responded
nearly normally to external stimuli during vocalization. Based on these findings,
we propose that the suppression of auditory cortical neurons, possibly
originating from cortical vocal production centers, acts to increase the dynamic 
range of cortical responses to vocalization feedback for self monitoring. The
excitatory responses, on the other hand, likely play a role in maintaining
hearing sensitivity to the external acoustic environment during vocalization.

A new subclass of the luteinizing hormone/chorionic gonadotropin receptor lacking
exon 10 messenger RNA in the New World monkey (Platyrrhini) lineage.

The luteinizing hormone receptor (LHR) plays an essential role as a mediator of
LH and CG action during embryonic sexual differentiation and in gametogenesis. In
a hypogonadal male patient, we recently demonstrated that a genomic deletion of
exon 10, located in the hinge region of the extracellular domain, results in
discrimination of LH and hCG action. In the common marmoset (Calltithrix
jacchus), exon 10 of the LHR is naturally missing at the mRNA level. In order to 
investigate whether this is an isolated species-specific phenomenon, we performed
a phylogenetic screening, searching for the presence of LHR exon 10 mRNA in a
number of primate species representative for the major lineages of primate
evolution. The expressed LHR region encompassing exon 10 was amplified from
testicular tissue by RT-PCR, cloned, and sequenced. In addition, we performed
Southern blot analysis of the LHR of selected New World and Old World primates.
The results revealed that exon 10 mRNA is lacking in the complete New World
monkey (Platyrrhini) lineage but is present in both more primitive and more
advanced primates. However, exon 10 seems to be present at the genomic level,
arguing for a splicing failure possibly due to a genomic mutation or the lack of 
appropriate splicing factors. Considering that, in the human, LH is far less
active than hCG on the LHR lacking exon 10, we addressed the question whether the
existence of such a receptor has any consequences on the dual hormone LH/CG
system present in Platyrrhini. Using primers specific for the known marmoset CG
beta cDNA, we amplified the CG beta subunit cDNA from male common marmoset
pituitaries by RT-PCR, while LH beta could not be amplified, suggesting a
possible physiological role of pituitary CG in this species. In conclusion, we
demonstrated for the first time that the LH mRNA without exon10 is the natural
wild-type LHR in the Platyrrhini lineage. We propose that this LHR represents a
new subclass of receptors that should be named LHR type II. In addition, the high
expression of CG beta in the marmoset pituitary suggests a physiological role of 
CG in the reproductive function of these primates beyond pregnancy.

likely to elicit explorative behaviors, and how their presence affects aggressive

for captive primates and show that in marmosets, their effectiveness strongly
depends on location within the enclosure and the presence of hidden food.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) as a model in toxicology.

Zühlke U(1), Weinbauer G.

Author information: 
(1)Covance Laboratories GmbH, 48163 Münster, Germany.

The common marmoset, Callithrix jacchus, is the smallest nonhuman primate
commonly used in biomedical research. Marmoset characteristics and propensities
have enabled them to be used in a wide range of research as a model of human
disease, physiology, drug metabolism, general toxicology, and reproductive
biology. This paper provides a general overview of the marmoset with special
emphasis on the benefits and disadvantages of this species as a model for
inclusion in preclinical drug development programmes. In view of its small size
in comparison with other nonrodent species marmosets have become of value for
toxicology studies with biotechnology products where compound supply is limited. 
In general toxicology studies, marmosets have been successfully used to meet
regulatory endpoints also for specific investigatory purposes. The widespread use
of this species has allowed extensive background information to become available 
and a summary of the most frequently measured parameters are presented. Marmosets
apparently represent an interesting animal model for comparative research on
primate reproductive physiology. However, several basic aspects of reproductive
processes exhibit cardinal discrepancies to those described for macaques and
human. Thus, from the viewpoint of reproductive toxicology, the relevance of the 
marmoset primate model for human reproduction remains unclear to date and further
research is obviously needed. Given our current knowledge of marmoset
reproductive features, the use of this animal model cannot be recommended for
reproductive toxicology assessment.

Assessment of a combination of physostigmine and scopolamine as pretreatment
against the behavioural effects of organophosphates in the common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus).

RATIONALE: There is a requirement to ensure that UK armed forces are provided
with the best possible medical countermeasures to prevent or mitigate the effects
of exposure to nerve agents. When pretreatments are under consideration, it is of
particular importance to ensure that they do not in themselves give rise to
adverse effects and do not exacerbate the effects of agent exposure.
OBJECTIVES: The present study was designed to address these considerations for a 
combination of physostigmine and scopolamine as a potential pretreatment regimen.
METHODS: Common marmosets were trained to perform a two-choice discrimination
serial reversal task, and baseline data were collected. Subjects received a dose 
of either soman or sarin after 2 weeks of pretreatment with either saline or
physostigmine and scopolamine via miniosmotic pump.
RESULTS: No effects of physostigmine and scopolamine were seen on task accuracy
or response rates. Neither accuracy of reversal performance nor number of
responses made were significantly changed by administration of either soman or
sarin subsequent to pretreatment with physostigmine/scopolamine. In the groups
pretreated with saline, performance of the behavioural task, in terms of
responses made, was virtually abolished on the day the OP was administered, but a
significant increase in accuracy of performance was seen over the 2- to 14-day
period following administration.
CONCLUSIONS: A combination of physostigmine and scopolamine, which is known to
protect against nerve-agent lethality, offers protection against the effects of
soman and sarin on behavioural performance, as measured by a discrimination
reversal task. The improved performance observed following nerve agent requires
further investigation.

Antifertility effect of an octapeptide, a fragment of FSH binding inhibitor, in

Health, J M Street, Parel, Mumbai 400012, India.

The follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) binding inhibitor (FSHBI) has been
identified as one of the factors present in follicular fluid exerting
autocrine/paracrine effects on FSH actions in the ovary. Our group has isolated
FSHBI from human ovarian follicular fluid and deduced its partial amino acid
sequence from the N-terminal region. A synthetic peptide corresponding to this
sequence also demonstrated FSH binding inhibitory activity in vitro. The
objective of the present study was to elucidate the effect of the octapeptide on 
ovarian cyclicity and pregnancy in the common marmoset. For the study, three
groups of postpartum marmosets were treated with the octapeptide during the
follicular phase. Administration of the octapeptide from days 6-10 postpartum
(pp) predominantly induced luteal insufficiency in two of seven and two of five
marmosets at a dose of 100 microg/day (group 1) and 300 microg/day (group 2),
respectively. This was confirmed by the presence of small regressing corpora
lutea on day 13 pp. Pregnancy was terminated prematurely in one animal from each 
of these groups. The treatment impaired fertility by 43% and 60% in the marmosets
of groups 1 and 2, respectively. In view of the fact that FSH levels peak on day 
2 and day 6 of the follicular phase in marmosets, a third group was administered 
200 microg/day octapeptide from days 1-8 pp. The treatment induced luteal
insufficiency in one out of four marmosets, while premature termination of
pregnancy occurred in two other marmosets of this group, demonstrating a 75%
effect on pregnancy. Thus, treatment of marmosets with the octapeptide, a
fragment of the FSHBI, predominantly induced luteal insufficiency as well as
resorption of the fetus leading to impairment of fertility.

Degree of social contact affects the emission of food calls in the common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).

The aim of this study was to investigate whether the emission of food calls in
common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) is influenced by different social contexts.
Food calls are emitted by this species only in the presence of preferred food. If
these calls have any communicative function, it may be that individuals produce
food calls in order to call family mates toward the food source. If this is the
case, the number of calls produced should vary in accordance with the number of
family mates present at the moment of the discovery of the food, i.e., the fewer 
family mates nearby, the more food calls are emitted. This hypothesis was tested 
with five pairs of common marmosets, by recording the number of food calls
emitted in four experimental conditions: 1). isolation: completely isolated from 
the family mates; 2). visual isolation: separated by a wooden panel from the
family mates; 3). visual contact: separated by a wire-mesh from the family mates;
and 4). physical interaction: together with the family mates. The results show
that the proportion of intervals during which food calls were produced by the
pairs was significantly different in the four experimental conditions. It
decreased from the isolation and visual isolation condition, through the visual
contact condition, reaching the lowest value in the physical interaction
condition. The variation observed in the proportion of intervals during which
food calls were emitted, in relation to different social contexts, is an
indication in favor of the communicative function of this vocalization.

In this paper, the occurrence of an external genital abnormality in female
marmoset monkeys (fused labia) is discussed. This malformation was detected, for 
the first time, in a group of animals at the German Primate Center (GPC),
Goettingen. The malformed vulva was completely sealed except for an opening of
1.5-2.5 mm around the urethra sufficient for urination. Because of this defect
the animals were not able to copulate. As a consequence, the affected females
were functionally infertile although they had a normal genital tract and a
regular cycle. This vulvar abnormality was found in 12 females, offspring of 10
pairs in which either one or both came to the German Primate Center from two
genetically related colonies in Munich, Germany, and one colony in Basel,
Switzerland. The abnormality appeared to be recessive and inheritable from either
parent. In pairs in which both animals were from one of the mentioned colonies,
45% of the female offspring were affected. In pairs where only one partner came
from these colonies, 26% of female offspring had the malformation. These results 
indicate that avoidance of inbreeding, which is frequently performed in primate
colonies, may reduce, but not eliminate the expression of abnormalities of
genetic origin. Therefore selective breeding is required, and, in colonies where 
these recessive mutations are widespread, the development of genetic screening
tests would be advantageous.

Both short- and long-acting D-1/D-2 dopamine agonists induce less dyskinesia than
L-DOPA in the MPTP-lesioned common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).

The current concept of dyskinesia is that pulsatile stimulation of D-1 or D-2
receptors by L-DOPA or short-acting dopamine agonists is more likely to induce
dyskinesia compared to long-acting drugs producing more continuous receptor
stimulation. We now investigate the ability of two mixed D-1/D-2 agonists, namely
pergolide (long-acting) and apomorphine (short-acting), to induce dyskinesia in
drug-nai;ve MPTP-lesioned primates, compared to L-DOPA. Adult common marmosets
(Callithrix jacchus) were lesioned with MPTP (2 mg/kg/day sc for 5 days) and
subsequently treated with equieffective antiparkinsonian doses of L-DOPA,
apomorphine, or pergolide for 28 days. L-DOPA, apomorphine, and pergolide
reversed the MPTP-induced motor deficits to the same degree with no difference in
peak response. L-DOPA and apomorphine had a rapid onset of action and short
duration of effect producing a pulsatile motor response, while pergolide had a
slow onset and long-lasting activity producing a continuous profile of motor
stimulation. L-DOPA rapidly induced dyskinesia that increased markedly in
severity and frequency over the course of the study, impairing normal motor
activity by day 20. Dyskinesia in animals treated with pergolide or apomorphine
increased steadily, reaching mild to moderate severity but remaining
significantly less marked than that produced by L-DOPA. There was no difference
in the intensity of dyskinesia produced by apomorphine and pergolide. These data 
suggest that factors other than duration of drug action may be important in the
induction of dyskinesia but support the use of dopamine agonists in early
Parkinson's disease, as a means of delaying L-DOPA therapy and reducing the risk 
of developing dyskinesia.

Repeated parental deprivation in the infant common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus, 
primates) and analysis of its effects on early development.

Dettling AC(1), Feldon J, Pryce CR.

Technology, Zurich, Schwerzenbach, Switzerland.

BACKGROUND: We describe a successful demonstration that repeated early
deprivation of parental care (ED), as used to study effects of early life stress 
in rats, can be performed in a primate and that it constitutes an early life
stressor.
METHODS: Seven breeding pairs of marmoset monkeys each provided control twins
(CON) and twins that were subjected to ED for 30-120 min/day on postnatal days
(PND) 2-28. Urine samples were obtained to monitor the acute effect of ED on
cortisol and catecholamine levels. Behavior samples were obtained in the home
cage to monitor the effects of ED on infant and infant-parent behavior.
RESULTS: Early deprivation of parental care caused acute increases in cortisol,
epinephrine, and norepinephrine. At PND 28, basal cortisol was reduced in ED
compared with CON infants, and ED infants were smaller than CON infants. Early
deprivation infants tended to spend more time in the suckling position than did
CON. Early deprivation infants demonstrated more distress vocalization than CON
infants, even though the parental care they received in the home cage was
similar. Early deprivation infants tended to play less socially than did CON.
CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that a repeated
early life stressor of the type developed in rats can also be applied to a
primate species.

Characterization of urinary and fecal metabolites of testosterone and their
measurement for assessing gonadal endocrine function in male nonhuman primates.

The aims of the present study were (i) to provide basic comparative data on the
time course, route, and characteristics of excreted [14C]testosterone (T)
metabolites in three nonhuman primates: the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus),
the long-tailed macaque (Macaca fascicularis) and the chimpanzee (Pan
troglodytes) and (ii) to use this information to help validate the measurement of
urinary and fecal testosterone metabolites for assessing androgen status in
Anthropoid primates. Radiolabeled 14C-T (10-30 microCi) was injected
intravenously into one adult male of each species and the excreta collected over 
the next 5 days. Peak radioactivity in urine was detected within 2h and accounted
for 67% (Mf), 80% (Cj) and 91% (Pt) of the total radioactivity recovered. The
time course of excretion of radioactivity in feces showed a higher variation
between species (4-26 h to peak values). In all three species, the majority
(>90%) of urinary metabolites were excreted as conjugates whereas the proportion 
of conjugated metabolites in feces was substantially lower and more variable.
High pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of urinary and fecal extracts
revealed multiple peaks of radioactivity in all three individuals, but each with 
a distinctive pattern. Native T was excreted in only small amounts into the
urine, whereas it was virtually absent in the feces of all three individuals.
Three C17 group-specific enzymeimmunoassays using antisera against testosterone, 
5alpha-androstane-17alpha-ol-3-one and androsterone were evaluated for their
ability to discriminate immunoreactive androgen levels between intact males,
castrated males and females based on measurements in urine and feces. In the
marmoset, all assays (except for T in feces) clearly discriminated between test
groups; in the chimpanzee significantly higher levels of androgen
immunoreactivity in intact versus castrated males were measured in urine, but not
feces. In the macaque, only the 5alpha-androstanolone measurement in feces
discriminated between groups. Data on the results of a radiometabolism study
using 3H-DHEA (a weak adrenal androgen) in a long-tailed macaque suggested that
co-measurement of metabolites derived from T and DHEA in the assays tested might 
explain the difficulties in discriminating gonadal status in the two Old World
primate species. Collectively, the data show that T metabolism in primates is
highly complex and that no single method for noninvasive assessment of androgen
status can be used for application across species. The importance of a proper
validation of the methodology for each species is emphasised.

Parent-daughter relationships and social controls on fertility in female common
marmosets, Callithrix jacchus.

This study examined the reproductive status of mothers and daughters to determine
if parent-eldest daughter interactions would influence the daughter's fertility
in the cooperatively breeding common marmoset, Callithrix jacchus. Twice weekly
fecal samples were collected for hormonal analyses from seven daughters and their
mothers and analyzed for cortisol, estradiol, and progesterone by EIA. Behavioral
data were collected three times weekly while the daughters were under three
conditions: natal family, after removing from the family and paring with a novel 
male, and after removing from the paired condition and placed back with the
family (renatal). Under the natal condition, five of the seven daughters
exhibited ovarian cycles while their mother was pregnant or displaying ovarian
cycling. The five cycling daughters spent significantly more time initiating
affilative behaviors with their mothers than with their fathers and showed
significant changes in their behavior over the length of the ovarian cycle.
However, aggression, submission, and sexual behaviors were very low for daughters
in the natal phase. No differences between cortisol levels were found for a
daughter and her mother. Cortisol levels showed a significant and sustained
increase upon pairing within the first 20 days. All females but one cycled while 
paired. Six of the seven females were accepted back into the family after pairing
and five of the seven females were ovulating. These results suggest that marmoset
daughters are not necessarily reproductively suppressed while living with the
family. Additionally, these data suggest that female marmosets that leave their
family to explore mating opportunities with other groups may return to their
family without reproductive or aggressive consequences.

The experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model in the common marmoset 
approximates recognized features of the human disease multiple sclerosis (MS)
with regard to its clinical presentation as well as neuropathological and
radiological aspects of the lesions in brain and spinal cord. IL-12 is a
proinflammatory cytokine that is produced by APC and promotes differentiation of 
Th1 effector cells. IL-12 is produced in the developing lesions of patients with 
MS as well as in EAE-affected animals. Previously it was shown that interference 
in IL-12 pathways effectively prevents EAE in rodents. In this study we report
that in vivo neutralization of IL-12p40 using a novel Ab has beneficial effects
in the myelin-induced EAE model in common marmosets. The Ab was injected i.v. at 
7-day intervals starting well after immunization (day 14) and was continued until
the end of the study (day 86). Stable levels of the Ab were measured 3 days after
each injection throughout the study period. During this period anti-Ab responses 
could not be detected. We demonstrate that anti-IL-12p40 treatment has a
protective effect on the neurological dysfunction as well as on neuropathological
changes normally observed in the brain and spinal cord of EAE-affected
individuals.

Complete genomic sequence of an Epstein-Barr virus-related herpesvirus naturally 
infecting a new world primate: a defining point in the evolution of oncogenic
lymphocryptoviruses.

Callitrichine herpesvirus 3 (CalHV-3) was isolated from a B-cell lymphoma arising
spontaneously in the New World primate Callithrix jacchus, the common marmoset.
Partial genomic sequence analysis definitively identified CalHV-3 as a member of 
the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-related lymphocryptovirus (LCV) genus and extended
the known host range of LCVs beyond humans and Old World nonhuman primates. We
have now completed the first genomic sequence of an LCV infecting a New World
primate by describing the unique short region, the major internal repeat, and a
portion of the unique long region. This portion of the genome contains the
putative latent origin of replication and 13 additional open reading frames
(ORFs), 5 of which show no homology to any viral or cell genes. One of the novel 
genes, C5, is a positional homologue for the transformation-essential EBV gene
EBNA-2. The marmoset LCV genome is also notable for the absence of viral
interleukin-10 and small nonpolyadenylated RNA homologues. Marmoset LCV
transcripts encoding putative latent infection nuclear proteins have a common
leader sequence that is spliced from the major internal repeat in a manner
similar to that of the EBV EBNA-LP, suggesting strong conservation of a common
promoter and splicing of these latent infection mRNAs. An EBV LMP2A-like spliced 
transcript crossing the terminal repeats encodes a unique ORF, C7, with multiple 
transmembrane domains and tyrosine kinase phosphorylation sites functionally
reminiscent of EBV LMP2A. However, the carboxy-terminal location of the candidate
phosphotyrosine residues is more reminiscent of the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated
herpesvirus K15 gene and provides potential evidence of an evolutionary
transition from rhadinoviruses to lymphocryptoviruses. The unusual gene
repertoire of the marmoset LCV differentiates ancestral viral genes likely
present in an LCV progenitor from viral genes acquired later as primates and LCV 
coevolved, providing a defining point in the evolution of oncogenic LCVs.

Naloxone reduces levodopa-induced dyskinesias and apomorphine-induced rotations
in primate models of parkinsonism.

Using in situ hybridization, it was found that subchronic treatment with
levodopa/benserazide increased preproenkephalin-A and preproenkephalin-B mRNAs in
the dopamine-depleted striatum. In order to examine whether dysfunction of the
endogenous opioid system may underlie the development of levodopa-induced
dyskinesias, the effect of naloxone, an opioid antagonist, on dyskinesias was
investigated in two models of parkinsonism in the common marmoset. MPTP-treated
monkeys were administered a daily oral dose of levodopa/benserazide which
relieved the parkinsonian symptoms but induced severe and reproducible dyskinetic
movements. Naloxone (0.1, 0.2 or 0.5 mg/kg) was given subcutaneously (s.c.)
during peak-dose dyskinesia, which reduced the dyskinesias significantly using
the highest dose, normalized the motor activity, but did not modify the
antiparkinson effect. Unilaterally 6-OHDA -lesioned marmosets received
apomorphine s.c., which caused a contralateral turning behavior that could be
reduced up to 35 percent by concomitant administration of naloxone. Taken
together the present results suggest a possible role for the endogenous opioid
system in the pathogenesis of levodopa-induced dyskinesia in primates.

The mammalian primary olfactory system consists of a set of different
telencephalic structures, including paleo-, archi-, periarchi- and mesocortical
components. We present the first characterisation of the normal and connectional 
anatomy of the primary olfactory cortex of the common marmoset, a microsmatic
simian species increasingly used in primate research. The centrifugal and
centripetal bulbar projections were determined by injections of the anterograde
and retrograde tracer wheat germ agglutinin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase and
fluorescent dyes into the ipsilateral main olfactory bulb. The efferent
projections of the marmoset bulb are organised entirely ipsilaterally and are
established via a rudimentary medial olfactory tract and the dominant lateral
olfactory tract. Target areas are the anterior olfactory nucleus, the entire
prepiriform cortex, ventral tenia tecta, periamygdaloid cortex and the rostral
part of the entorhinal cortex. The bulbar axons predominantly terminate in the
outer part of layer I. The anterior olfactory nucleus receives a weak additional 
input within layer II and III, which is not found in macrosmatic rodents. Further
anterograde labelling was found in the endopiriform nucleus deep under the
prepiriform cortex and within an anterolateral strip of the olfactory tubercle.
However, control injections into the olfactory tubercle suggest that the marmoset
olfactory tubercle receives a bisynaptic olfactory input only. Retrograde
labelling after bulb injections revealed that, except for the olfactory tubercle,
all primary olfactory cortices contributed to an ipsilateral bulbopetal feedback 
projection. Like in rodents, the only bulbopetal projection organised bilaterally
in the marmoset is maintained by the anterior olfactory nucleus. With few
exceptions, the projections of the marmoset olfactory brain are organised
similarly to that of the macaque monkey or those of macrosmatic species.

The monoamine reuptake blocker brasofensine reverses akinesia without dyskinesia 
in MPTP-treated and levodopa-primed common marmosets.

The common marmoset develops motor deficits after MPTP treatment and exhibits
dyskinesia after chronic levodopa (L-dopa) dosing and subsequent re-challenge
with L-dopa and other dopaminergic agents. We report on the actions of the potent
monoamine reuptake blocker brasofensine on motor disability, locomotor activity, 
and dyskinesia in the 1-methyl-4-1, 2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) -treated
marmoset model of Parkinson's disease. Oral administration of brasofensine (0.25,
0.5, 1.0, or 2.5 mg/kg) to MPTP-treated marmosets produced a long-lasting,
dose-dependent increase in locomotor activity and reduction in disability scores.
In addition, coadministration of the lowest dose of brasofensine (0.25 mg/kg
orally) with a threshold oral dose of L-dopa (2.5 mg/kg) caused a marked increase
in locomotor activity, greater than that produced by either drug alone. In other 
MPTP-treated marmosets previously primed to exhibit dyskinesia by repeated L-dopa
dosing, brasofensine effectively reversed akinesia with a naturalistic and
prolonged motor response without the appearance of dyskinesia or stereotypy. This
finding contrasts with the severe dyskinesia, stereotypy, and hyperkinesis
produced by equivalent doses of L-dopa. The ability of brasofensine to produce a 
prolonged and naturalistic antiparkinsonian response without eliciting dyskinesia
after previous L-dopa priming may relate to actions on D(1) receptor-linked
pathways. These findings suggest that monoamine reuptake blockade may be of value
in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, both early in the disease course and
when L-dopa-induced dyskinesias complicate treatment.

Intestinal microbial patterns of the common marmoset and rhesus macaque.

Madison, WI 53715, USA. bailey.494@osu.edu

The intestinal microflora of common marmosets and rhesus monkeys were compared by
enumerating bacteria from the small and large intestines. Rhesus monkeys had a
consistent microflora pattern manifest by higher concentrations of total and
Gram-negative aerobic and facultatively anaerobic bacteria, as well as aerobic
and anaerobic Lactobacilli, in the large intestine as compared to the small
intestine. In contrast, the marmoset microflora were considerably more variable. 
Approximately two-thirds of the marmosets (designated group A) had an overall
profile that resembled the rhesus monkeys, but they had significantly higher
concentrations of Gram-negative microflora in their large intestines than the
rhesus monkeys. The remaining marmosets (group B) had higher concentrations of
bacteria in the small intestine as compared to the large intestine, with the
large intestinal concentrations being significantly lower than in the rhesus
monkeys and group A marmosets. Moreover, the marmosets did not have detectable
levels of aerobic Lactobacilli, and anaerobic Lactobacilli concentrations were
significantly lower than in the rhesus macaques. Although it is unknown why
microflora differ across species, it is likely that evolutionary adaptations in
anatomy and functioning of the gastrointestinal tract influence the concentration
and types of bacteria residing as the normal intestinal microflora.

Neonatal behavioral scoring of common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus): relation to
physical condition and survival.

A seven-task behavioral test was performed on 86 common marmoset (Callithrix
jacchus) infants, 24-36 h following birth. This report describes the test outcome
and its relation to physical condition and survival of the infants. The
percentage of infants receiving a perfect score on a given task ranged from 30.6 
(rooting) to 70.6% (grasping). Heavier infants were more likely to have perfect
scores for crawling (F=4.20, P=0.044) and infants with a longer knee-heel length 
tended to be more likely to have a perfect grasping score (F=3.63, P=0.06). While
the modal score was a perfect score for most individual tasks, the modal number
of total perfect scores that a given infant received was 3-4 and only 4.7% of
infants received perfect scores on all seven tasks. These results suggest that
this group of behavioral tasks will produce a variable response within a
population of neonates. While no individual behavioral score predicted survival
during week 1, the number of perfect scores across all tasks was predictive of
survival outcome; infants with a higher total number of perfect scores were more 
likely to survive (F=6.02, P=0.018). When all combinations of tests were
compared, the best predictor of survival was outcome on four of the seven tests, 
all related to motor skills (F=7.46, P=0.009).

Blockade of HIV-1 infection of New World monkey cells occurs primarily at the
stage of virus entry.

HIV-1 naturally infects chimpanzees and humans, but does not infect Old World
monkeys because of replication blocks that occur after virus entry into the cell.
To understand the species-specific restrictions operating on HIV-1 infection, the
ability of HIV-1 to infect the cells of New World monkeys was examined. Primary
cells derived from common marmosets and squirrel monkeys support every phase of
HIV-1 replication with the exception of virus entry. Efficient HIV-1 entry
typically requires binding of the viral envelope glycoproteins and host cell
receptors, CD4 and either CCR5 or CXCR4 chemokine receptors. HIV-1 did not
detectably bind or utilize squirrel monkey CD4 for entry, and marmoset CD4 was
also very inefficient compared with human CD4. A marmoset CD4 variant, in which
residues 48 and 59 were altered to the amino acids found in human CD4, supported 
HIV-1 entry efficiently. The CXCR4 molecules of both marmosets and squirrel
monkeys supported HIV-1 infection, but the CCR5 proteins of both species were
only marginally functional. These results demonstrate that the CD4 and CCR5
proteins of New World monkeys represent the major restriction against HIV-1
replication in these primates. Directed adaptation of the HIV-1 envelope
glycoproteins to common marmoset receptors might allow the development of New
World monkey models of HIV-1 infection.

Sense of taste in a new world monkey, the common marmoset: recordings from the
chorda tympani and glossopharyngeal nerves.

Whole nerve, as well as single fiber, responses in the chorda tympani proper (CT)
and glossopharyngeal (NG) nerves of common marmosets were recorded during taste
stimulation with three salts, four acids, six bitter compounds and more than 30
sweeteners. We recorded responses of 49 CT and 41 NG taste fibers. The
hierarchical cluster analysis distinguished three major clusters in both CT and
NG: S, Q, and H. The S(CT) fibers, 38% of all CT fibers, responded only to
sweeteners. The S(CT) fibers did not respond during stimulation with salts,
acids, and bitter compounds but exhibited OFF responses after citric and ascorbic
acids, quinine hydrochloride (QHCl), and salts (in 80% of S(CT) fibers). S(NG)
fibers, 50% of all NG fibers, also responded to sweeteners but not to stimuli of 
other taste qualities (except for citric acid, which stimulated 70% of the S(NG) 
fibers). Some sweeteners, including natural (the sweet proteins brazzein,
monellin) and artificial [cyclamate, neohesperidin dihydrochalcone (NHDHC),
N-3,5-dichlorophenyl-N'-(S)-alpha-methylbenzylguanidineacetate (DMGA),
N-4-cyanophenylcarbamoyl-(R,S)-3-amino-3-(3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl) propionic
acid (CAMPA)] did not elicit responses in the S fibers. In general, the response 
profiles of the S(CT) and S(NG) clusters were very similar, the correlation
coefficient between the responses to sweeteners in these clusters was 0.94. Both 
the Q(CT) and the Q(NG) fibers (40 and 46% of all fibers) were predominantly
responsive to bitter compounds, although their responses to the same set of
bitter compounds were quite different. Sweeteners with sweet/bitter taste for
humans also stimulated the Q clusters. The H clusters (22 and 3% of all fibers)
were predominantly responsive to acids and did not respond to stimuli of other
taste qualities. However, bitter stimuli, mainly QHCl, inhibited activity in 70% 
of H(CT) fibers. Among a total of 90 fibers from both nerves there was only 1
NaCl-best fiber in CT. We found, however, that 35% of the CT fibers reacted to
salts with inhibition of activity during stimulation, followed by an OFF
response. This OFF response was diminished or eliminated by amiloride. These
characteristics indicate that amiloride-sensitive sodium channels are involved in
salt transduction in marmosets. In the two NG fibers responding to NaCl, we
recorded neither suppression by amiloride nor OFF responses. Comparison of
marmoset data with those of other nonhuman primates studied, rhesus and
chimpanzee, demonstrates phylogenetic trends in the organization of taste system.
This can help to uncover pathways of primate evolution.

Diurnal rhythms in intraocular pressure, axial length, and choroidal thickness in
a primate model of eye growth, the common marmoset.

PURPOSE: In chickens, there are circadian rhythms in axial length, choroidal
thickness, and intraocular pressure (IOP), the phases of which differ, depending 
on visual manipulations that alter ocular growth rate. In this study, these same 
rhythms were sought in the common marmoset, a primate model of eye growth, to
establish whether these may play a role in ocular growth regulation across
species.
METHODS: IOP was measured by applanation tonometry in 14 untreated marmosets
ranging in age from 24 to 259 days. High-frequency A-scan ultrasonography was
used to measure ocular dimensions (axial length and choroidal thickness) in 12
marmosets ranging in age from 24 to 572 days. Four monkeys were measured when
they were juveniles (<110 days of age) and again later, when they were
adolescents. Measurements were typically made at 12-hour intervals, although
three animals were measured at 6-hour intervals. Nine monkeys had both IOP and
axial dimensions measured in the same experiment.
RESULTS: There was a diurnal rhythm in IOP in the marmosets: IOP was higher
during the dark period and lower during the light period (mean change, 3.6 mm Hg;
P < 0.005). There were also rhythms in axial length and choroidal thickness. The 
rhythm in axial length was dependent on age, with faster-growing eyes of
juveniles increasing in length during the day and decreasing at night (+25 microm
vs. -22 microm; P < 0.001) and slower-growing eyes of adolescents showing the
opposite pattern (-27 microm vs. +46 microm; P < 0.0001). The choroid thickened
during the night and thinned during the day, at all ages measured (+19 microm vs.
-16 microm; P < 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: Diurnal rhythms in IOP, axial length, and choroidal thickness exist 
in primates. Age-related differences in the phase relationships of these rhythms 
may be associated with differences in the rates of ocular growth.

Islet hyperplasia in callitrichids.

Five callitrichids (three common marmosets -Callithrix jacchus -, a black
tufted-eared marmoset -C. penicillata-, and a saddle-back tamarin -Saguinus
fuscicollis) were diagnosed with islet hyperplasia by histopathology and
immunohistochemistry. All were privately-owned, unrelated callitrichids ranging
from 2- to 4-year-old. Relevant findings were anorexia (3/5), vomiting (2/5),
ptyalism (1/5), polyuria/polydipsia (1/5), respiratory distress (1/5),
hyperglycemia (2/3) and glycosuria (1/1); hyperglycemia and glycosuria were
associated with pregnancy in a common marmoset and resolved after reducing simple
carbohydrates in diet. All five animals died, three of them after few premonitory
signs; in two cases, other concurrent diseases unrelated to islet hyperplasia
were considered the cause of death. Additional animals from two facilities had
high weight (4), physical obesity (3), polyuria/polydipsia/polyphagia/uriposia
(1), hyperglycemia (1), and/or glycosuria (2). Pathologic findings in the
deceased callitrichids were: islet hyperplasia (5/5); hemosiderosis (5/5);
lipomatosis (4/5) of several tissues (atria, 3/5; pancreas, gall bladder,
intestine, esophagus, and thyroid, 2/5; liver, 1/5); pancreatic necrosis or
steatonecrosis, and/or acute pancreatitis (3/5); and vacuolation of hepatocytes
and renal tubular cells most likely consistent with hepatorenal lipidosis (2/5). 
The islets of Langerhans were more numerous and larger than in a control, and
morphologically normal in all cases, except in a common marmoset that had a few
cells with a foamy cytoplasm and shrunken hyperchromatic or picknotic nucleus.
Insulin (5/5), glucagon (3/5), and somatostatin (3/5) immunohistochemistry
revealed that most cells stained positively for insulin diffusely in their
cytoplasm (5/5) (staining restricted to the vascular pole of b-cells in the
control). These findings suggest that obesity, insulin resistance and/or type II 
diabetes may be implicated and thus a prospective study on these diseases in
callitrichids is necessary to determine their etiopathogenesis.

Non-human primates are often used in biomedical research, and the application of 
these animals as a model in immune-related diseases necessitates the
characterisation of their MHC system. In particular, the MHC class II regions of 
the chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), the rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta)and the
common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) have been subject of molecular biological
studies in recent years. In this study the emphasis was on MHC class II genes of 
another macaque species, Macaca fascicularis(crab eating macaque or cynomolgous
monkey). The exon 2 of the Mhc-DQB gene (Mafa-DQB) was sequenced in each of a
random panel of 60 non-pedigreed cynomolgous monkeys. This resulted in the
detection of 23 Mafa-DQB1alleles that had not previously been published. In
addition, unreported alleles were found in chimpanzees, rhesus macaques,
orang-utans (Pongo pygmaeus) and stump-tailed macaques (Macaca arctoides), of
which a few individuals were included in this study. Phylogenetic analyses
confirm the trans-species model of evolution of the MHC-DQBlineages, in which a
group of major alleles is passed on in the phylogeny, and has led to the sharing 
of allelic lineages by different species of non-human primates. The sharing of
alleles is observed only for closely related macaque species. Furthermore, this
manuscript provides an overview of all published, and whenever necessary
corrected, non-human primate Mhc-DQB exon 2 alleles.

5-Iodo-3-(2(S)-azetidinylmethoxy)pyridine (5IA), an A-85380 analog iodinated at
the 5-position of the pyridine ring, was evaluated as a radiopharmaceutical for
investigating brain nicotinic acethylcholine receptors (nAChRs) by single photon 
emission computed tomography (SPECT). [123/125I]5IA was synthesized by the
iododestannylation reaction under no-carrier-added conditions and purified by
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with high radiochemical yield
(50%), high radiochemical purity (> 98%), and high specific radioactivity (> 55
GBq/micromol). The binding affinity of 5IA for brain nAChRs was measured in terms
of displacement of [3H]cytisine and [125I]5IA from binding sites in rat cortical 
membranes. The binding data revealed that the affinity of 5IA was the same as
that of A-85380 and more than seven fold higher than that of (-)-nicotine, and
that 5IA bound selectively to the alpha4beta2 nAChR subtype. Biodistribution
studies in rats indicated that the brain uptake of [125I]51A was rapid and
profound. Regional cerebral distribution studies in rats demonstrated that the
accumulation of [125I]5IA was consistent with the density of high affinity nAChRs
with highest uptake observed in the nAChR-rich thalamus, moderate uptake in the
cortex and lowest uptake in the cerebellum. Administration of the nAChR agonists 
(-)-cytisine and (-)-nicotine reduced the uptake of [125I]5IA in all regions
studied with most pronounced reduction in the thalamus, and resulted in similar
levels of radioactivity throughout the brain. [125I]5IA binding sites were shown 
to be saturable with unlabeled 5IA. Behavioral studies in mice demonstrated that 
5IA did not show signs of behavioral toxicity. Furthermore, SPECT studies with
[123I]5IA in the common marmoset demonstrated appropriate brain uptake and
regional localization for a high-affinity nAChR imaging radiopharmaceutical.
These results suggested that [123I]5IA is a promising radiopharmaceutical for
SPECT studies of central nAChRs in human subjects.

Long-term effects of adverse early environment on neurobehavioral development
have been reported for rodents and primates. The present study used daily early
deprivation (ED), a paradigm developed for rats, for the first time in a nonhuman
primate, the common marmoset, and investigated its effects on the behavioral and 
physiological responses to social separation/novelty (SSN) challenge tests in
juveniles. On postnatal days (PNDs) 2-28, infants (n=5 twin pairs) were removed
from the parents and placed alone in an isolation chamber for 30-120 min (9
h/week). Parents and control subjects (n=5 twin pairs) were briefly restrained
(CON). At Weeks 18-20, behavioral responses of ED and CON juveniles to six 60-min
SSN tests in an isolated cage, comprising 45 min alone and 15 min reunion with
the father, were measured. Baseline and post-test urine samples were collected
for measurement of cortisol. ED subjects exhibited significantly lower basal SSN 
urinary cortisol than CON, whilst SSN response cortisol values were similar in ED
and CON. When alone, ED subjects were significantly less mobile and emitted
significantly less contact calls than CON. Following reunion, ED subjects were
significantly less in contact with or being carried by the father than CON and
demonstrated significantly more tail piloerection. Although they require
validation by additional parameters (e.g. cardiovascular), these data strongly
suggest that early-life stress alters endocrine and behavioral responsiveness to 
psychosocial challenge in this primate and in a direction that could model
important changes in disorders of human affective state.

A gammaherpesvirus related to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV; Human herpesvirus 4)
infects otherwise healthy common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus). Long-term
culture of common marmoset peripheral blood lymphocytes resulted in outgrowth of 
spontaneously immortalized lymphoblastoid cell lines, primarily of B cell
lineage. Electron microscopy of cells and supernatants showed herpesvirus
particles. There were high rates of serological cross-reactivity to other
herpesviruses (68-86%), but with very low geometric mean antibody titres [1:12 to
human herpesvirus 6 and 1:14 to Herpesvirus papio (Cercopithecine herpesvirus
12)]. Sequence analysis of the conserved herpesvirus DNA polymerase gene showed
that the virus is a member of the lymphocryptovirus subgroup and is most closely 
related to a lymphocryptovirus from rhesus macaques and is closely related to EBV
and Herpesvirus papio. High seroprevalence (79%, with geometric mean antibody
titre of 1:110) among 28 common marmosets from two geographically distinct
colonies indicated that the virus is likely present in many common marmosets in
captivity. A New World primate harbouring a lymphocryptovirus suggests that this 
subgroup arose much earlier than previously thought.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate a telemetry system for examining the
cardiovascular system in the conscious common marmoset. Parameters obtained were 
blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, ECG, body temperature and locomotor
activity, and these were continuously recorded on a data recorder via the
telemetry system and then processed by a computerized system. Diurnal rhythms of 
blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature and locomotor activity were observed
in this system. We studied the effects of astemizole (antihistamine) and
nicardipine (Ca2+ channel blocker) on cardiovascular parameters. Astemizole at 30
mg/kg (p.o.) and at 1 to 3 mg/kg (i.v.), prolonged QT interval and induced
ventricular extrasystole. Torsades de pointes occurred in one of three cases at 3
mg/kg (i.v.) and 30 mg/kg (p.o.), while it did not affect the blood pressure,
respiratory rate and body temperature. Nicardipine at 30 mg/kg (p.o.) caused
sustained hypotension and tachycardia. These results demonstrate the usefulness
of the telemetry system using the common marmoset for evaluating the
cardiovascular effects of drugs under physiological conditions.

The evolution of neuroendocrine mechanisms regulating sexual behaviour in female 
primates.

Diego, California 92112-0551, USA. adixson@sandiegozoo.org

The common marmoset is a small New World primate that lives in extended family
groups. Female marmosets show rhythmic changes in proceptivity during their
28-Day ovarian cycle, but fluctuations in sexual receptivity are relatively
subtle. Receptivity persists even after ovariectomy and adrenalectomy in the
female marmoset. In the intact female, increases in proceptivity at mid cycle are
due to the activational effects of oestradiol. Treatment of the ovariectomized
female with oestradiol-17beta stimulates proceptivity and this effect is blocked 
by thermal or excitotoxic (neuronal cell body specific) lesions in the anterior
or medial hypothalamus. Implantation of oestradiol into the anterior hypothalamus
(via guide cannulae) also activates proceptivity. Luteinizing hormone releasing
hormone (LHRH) may also form part of the neuroendocrine mechanism controlling
proceptivity in the intact female, given that exogenous LHRH stimulates
proceptivity in ovariectomized, oestrogen-primed marmosets. These effects of
oestradiol (and LHRH) on proceptive displays are much more pronounced than any
effects involving sexual receptivity. Conversely, treatment of the ovariectomized
female with progesterone, at doses sufficient to produce luteal phase
concentrations of circulating hormone, causes a marked suppression of
proceptivity, but only small decreases in sexual receptivity. These experiments
on marmosets remain some of the very few studies to define how hormones influence
the brain and sexual behaviour in female primates. They support the conclusion
that sexual receptivity is not under rigid neuroendocrine control in female
anthropoids, and that there is no peri-ovulatory period of oestrus, such as
occurs in most non-primate mammals.

Molecular cloning of three nonhuman primate follicle stimulating hormone
beta-subunit cDNAs.

(1)Wisconsin Regional Primate Research Center, University of Wisconsin, Madison
53715-1299, USA.

The follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) beta-subunit cDNAs were cloned and
sequenced for an old world primate, the rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta), and two
New World primates, the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) and pygmy marmoset
(Cebuella pygmaea). The cDNA and predicted amino acid sequences of the rhesus
monkey FSH beta-subunit were related most closely to the human FSH beta-subunit
(> 96% identity). The common and pygmy marmosets have identical FSH beta-subunit 
cDNAs, whereas the marmoset FSH beta-subunit diverges from the rhesus and human
molecules with less than 93% identity. These results have significance for the
implementation of assisted reproductive technologies in the nonhuman primate as
well as the evolution of genes encoding reproductive hormones.

The distribution of presumptive thoracic paraganglionic tissue in the common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).

The aortic-pulmonary regions (APR) of seven adult marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) 
and the region of the right subclavian artery of a further three marmosets were
diffusion-fixed with 10% buffered formol-saline solution. In both regions serial 
5 microm sections were cut and stained by the Martius yellow, brilliant crystal
scarlet and soluble blue method. Presumptive thoracic paraganglionic (PTP) tissue
was only observed in the APR. PTP tissue was composed of small groups of cells
that varied in size and number. The distribution of the groups of cells was
extremely variable, so much so that it would be misleading to attempt to classify
their position; they were not circumscribed by a connective tissue capsule, but
were always related to the thoracic branches of the left vagus nerve. The cells
lay in loose areolar tissue characteristic of this part of the mediastinum and
received their blood supply from small adjacent connective tissue arterioles.
Unlike the paraganglionic tissue found in the carotid body the cells in the
thorax did not appear to have a profuse capillary blood supply. There was,
however, a close cellular-neural relationship. The cells, 10-15 microm in
diameter, were oval or rounded in appearance and possessed a central nucleus and 
clear cytoplasm. No evidence was found that these cells possessed a 'companion'
cell reminiscent of the arrangement of type 1 and type 2 cells in the carotid
body. In conclusion, we found evidence of presumed paraganglionic tissue in the
APR of the marmoset which, however, did not show the characteristic histological 
features of the aortic body chemoreceptors that have been described in some
non-primate mammals. A survey of the mediastina of other non-human primates is
required to establish whether this finding is atypical for these animals.

Cortical sensitivity in representations of behaviorally relevant complex input
signals was examined in recordings from primary auditory cortical neurons (AI) in
adult, barbiturate-anesthetized common marmoset monkeys (Callithrix jacchus). We 
studied the robustness of distributed responses to natural and degraded forms of 
twitter calls, social contact vocalizations comprising several quasi-periodic
phrases of frequency and AM. We recorded neuronal responses to a monkey's own
twitter call (MOC), degraded forms of their twitter call, and sinusoidal
amplitude modulated (SAM) tones with modulation rates similar to those of twitter
calls. In spectral envelope degradation, calls with narrowband channels of
varying bandwidths had the same temporal envelope as a natural call. However, the
carrier phase was randomized within each narrowband channel. In temporal envelope
degradation, the temporal envelope within narrowband channels was filtered while 
the carrier frequencies and phases remained unchanged. In a third form of
degradation, noise was added to the natural calls. Spatiotemporal discharge
patterns in AI both within and across frequency bands encoded spectrotemporal
acoustic features in the call although the encoded response is an abstract
version of the call. The average temporal response pattern in AI, however, was
significantly correlated with the average temporal envelope for each phrase of a 
call. Response entrainment to MOC was significantly correlated with entrainment
to SAM stimuli at comparable modulation frequencies. Sensitivity of the response 
patterns to MOC was substantially greater for temporal envelope than for spectral
envelope degradations. The distributed responses in AI were robust to additive
continuous noise at signal-to-noise ratios > or =10 dB. Neurophysiological data
reflecting response sensitivity in AI to these forms of degradation closely
parallel human psychophysical results on the intelligibility of degraded speech
in quiet and noisy conditions.

Few studies of body composition have been done in New World primates. In the
study reported here, four methods of assessing body composition (body weight,
anthropometry, labeled-water dilution, and total body electroconductivity) were
compared in 20 marmosets, aged 0.96 to 7.97 years. Males and females did not
differ in any measure (P > 0.05). Body weight ranged from 272 to 466 g, and body 
fat estimates varied from 1.6 to 19.5%. Strong positive correlations were
observed between total body water and total body electroconductivity (R2 = 0.77),
body weight and fat-free mass (males R2 = 0.95; females R2 = 0.91), and body
weight and fat mass (males R2 = 0.86; females R2 = 0.85; P < 0.01). Male and
female slopes were equivalent (P > 0.05) for the regressions of fat and fat-free 
mass against body weight. Positive correlations also were observed between girth 
measures and fat-free mass (R2 = 0.48 to 0.78) and fat mass (R2 = 0.60 to 0.74; P
< 0.01). A good second- order polynomial relationship was observed between age
and fat-free mass for the combined sample (R2 = 0.64). Results indicated that:
subjects were lean; there was no sexual dimorphism relative to measures; body
weight provided a reliable estimate of fat and fat-free mass; and within-subject 
body weight changes reflected a similar relationship between body weight and
fat-free mass as did that across subjects.

Thirteen adult common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) were given once-monthly
injections of haloperidol decanoate (5-15 mg/kg i.m.) for one year. Thereafter,
drug-free and treatment periods alternated at 3-month intervals. After 2.5 to 14 
months, 12 monkeys showed symptoms of tardive dyskinesia (TD), such as periocular
and perioral twitchings, tongue protrusions, masticatory movements, and choreic
movements in arms and legs. When TD symptoms were evident, the periodic treatment
was interrupted and symptoms persisted for at least 5 months after the last
haloperidol dose, worsened by injection of the anticholinergic drug biperiden. An
injection of nondepot haloperidol (0.12 or 0.25 mg/kg) produced a reduction of TD
symptoms. At the end of the study, nondepot haloperidol was injected once a week 
at two doses (0.12 and 0.25 mg/kg i.m.). A syndrome of excitation with peculiar
behavior, interpreted as acute dystonia, was precipitated in all animals. The
animals showed sustained retrocollis, climbing upside down, biting the perch,
repetitive turnings, and frequent backward movements. The dystonic movements
lasted approximately 6 hours and were reduced but not completely extinguished by 
biperiden (0.1 mg/kg). The TD syndrome registered in marmosets may provide a
useful model for screening new antipsychotics for their propensity to induce TD.

Hemochorial placentation in the primate: expression of vascular endothelial

Vascular development and its transformation are necessary for successful
hemochorial placentation, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF),
angiopoietins, and their receptors may be involved in the molecular regulation of
this process. To determine the potential role of these putative regulators in a
widely studied primate, the common marmoset, we investigated their mRNA
expression and protein location in the placenta throughout pregnancy using in
situ hybridization, Northern blot analysis, and immunocytochemistry. VEGF was
localized in decidual and cytotrophoblast cells, and its highest expression was
found in the maternal decidua. The Flt receptor was exclusively detected in the
syncytial trophoblast with increasing expression in placentae from 10 wk to term.
Soluble Flt (sFlt) was also detectable by Northern blot analysis. KDR receptor
expression was restricted to mesenchymal cells during early placentation and to
the fetoplacental vasculature during later placentation. KDR expression increased
throughout pregnancy. Angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1) was localized in the syncytial
trophoblast, being highly expressed in the second half of gestation. Ang-2 mRNA
localized exclusively to maternal endothelial cells, and was highly expressed in 
10-wk placentae. The Tie-2 receptor was found in cytotrophoblast cells and in
fetal and maternal vessels. High Tie-2 levels were detected in the wall of
chorion vessels at 14-wk, 17-wk, and term placentae. These results suggest that
the processes of trophoblast invasion, maternal vascular transformation, and
fetoplacental vascular differentiation and development are regulated by the
specific actions of angiogenic ligand-receptor pairs. Specifically, 1) VEGF/Flt
and Ang-1/Tie-2 may promote trophoblast growth, 2) VEGF/KDR and Ang-1/Tie-2 may
support fetoplacental vascular development and stabilization, 3) sFlt may balance
VEGF actions, and 4) Ang-2/Tie-2 may remodel the maternal vasculature.

The incidence, distribution and chemical composition of amyloid-beta (A beta)
peptide-positive deposits were investigated in the lower primate species common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). No A beta deposits were observed in the brains of 
7 marmosets below 7 years of age. In 15 marmosets above 7 years, 60% displayed
cortical A beta-immunoreactive plaques, 80% had A beta deposited in intracortical
vessels and 87% displayed A beta deposits in meningeal vessels. The cerebral
cortex of the oldest animal (15 years) contained a substantial density of
deposits. A beta-immunoreactive plaques were found predominantly in association
cortical zones followed by a lower density in paralimbic cortical areas. Deposits
within vessels were most frequent in occipital cortex. A beta40 was found
primarily in vascular deposits, while A beta42 was present in plaques.
Approximately 20% of plaques and most vascular deposits displayed thioflavin S
staining, indicative of the presence of fibrillar A beta. Varying proportions of 
A beta deposits contained acetylcholinesterase or butyrylcholinesterase
activities and apolipoprotein E and alpha1-antichymotrypsin immunoreactivity. A
few plaques contained immunoreactivity for amyloid precursor protein in swollen
neurites. However, no abnormally phosphorylated tau immunoreactivity was present 
in these neurites. Survival analysis in a colony of marmosets indicated that only
6% of animals can be expected to survive beyond 7 years of age. These results
indicate that the aged marmoset brain displays A beta deposits with a
distribution and chemical composition similar to those found in the human. These 
similarities suggest that the aged marmoset may be a useful lower primate model
for the study of the pathological effects of A beta. However, the relatively
small number of animals which can be expected to reach old age severely limits
the utility of this species as a model of A beta deposition.

Development of pituitary-adrenal endocrine function in the marmoset monkey:
infant hypercortisolism is the norm.

Early life stress, involving activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
(HPA) system, is associated with altered functioning of stress-related systems in
adulthood. In the rat, postnatal development is characterized by low basal HPA
activity and stress hyporesponsiveness, and infant exposure to atypical
glucocorticoid levels leads to chronic alteration of HPA function and
HPA-dependent peripheral and central processes. There have been few studies of
primate HPA ontogeny, and here we report a study of changes in pituitary-adrenal 
function between birth and adulthood in the common marmoset monkey. In this
simian primate, basal plasma ACTH and cortisol levels were actually elevated in
neonates (ACTH, 141 +/- 28 pg/ml; cortisol, 1903 +/- 326 microg/dl) and wk 4
infants (ACTH, 114 +/- 9 pg/ml; cortisol, 290 +/- 8 microg/dl) relative to month 
2 infants, juveniles (month 6), subadults (month 12), and adults (>2 yr; ACTH, 37
+/- 4 to 61 +/- 8 pg/ml; cortisol, 101 +/- 2 to 195 +/- 4 microg/dl). In contrast
to older life stages, neonates lacked circadian change in their plasma cortisol
levels, and this state of consistently high cortisol was associated with large
adrenal glands in addition to high ACTH levels. Cerebrospinal fluid cortisol
levels were, in accord with plasma levels, higher in wk 4 infants than in
juveniles and subadults. In terms of stress response, month 2 infants
demonstrated ACTH and cortisol peak stress responses similar to those at older
life stages (infant stress cortisol, 185 +/- 36% of basal; subadult stress
cortisol, 174 +/- 6% of basal); whereas infant ACTH recovery was also similar to 
that in older subjects, their cortisol poststress recovery was retarded. This
primate, it is proposed, provides an excellent complementary model in which to
test hypotheses derived from the rat model relating to HPA system ontogeny and
the chronic effects and biomedical implications of hypercorticoidism during early
life.

[Horizontal transmission of live attenuated hepatitis A vaccine virus].

[Article in Chinese]

Huang X(1), Cao Y, Tan S.

(1)Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking
Union Medical College, Kunming 650118, China.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the horizontal transmission of virus after inoculation 
with live attenuated hepatitis A vaccine.
METHODS: One hundred and ninety nine children aged 4 approximately 7 years
without anti-HAV and with normal ALT level have been screened out at two trial
fields in Anning, Kunming and divided into vaccine group (82 children) and
contact group (117 children) to observe the horizontal transmission of the live
attenuated hepatitis A vaccine virus (H2 strain). Four supernatant specimens of
HAV positive fecal suspension derived from individual vaccines and contacts were 
taken and injected intravenousely into 8 common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) for
detecting the virulence level of HAV.
RESULTS: The rates of seroconversion were 97.6% (80/82) for vaccine group 6 weeks
after inoculation and 13.7% (16/117) for contact group at the ninth week of
observation. The detection rates of fecal HAV were 89.5% (34/38) and 70.7%
(53/75), respectively. No liver functional abnormality has been found in either
groups. The responses of 8 marmosets separately infected with fecal shedding HAV 
of 2 vaccines and 2 contacts have been examined with neither elevations of serum 
liver enzyme nor liver histopathological changes but delay seroconversions as
well as low titers of anti-HAV.
CONCLUSION: The safety and immunogenicity live attenuated hepatitis A vaccine (H2
strain) were good. The vaccine virus could actively propagate but keep the
stability of attenuated characteristics in human bodies, and might result in
horizontal transmission but not induce hepatitis A in crowd.

Does the milk of Callitrichid monkeys differ from that of larger anthropoids?

Park, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, DC 20008, USA. powerm@nzp.si.edu

The generalization that anthropoid primates produce dilute milks that are low in 
protein and energy is based primarily on data from large monkeys of the families 
Cebidae and Cercopithecidae, as well as humans. The marmosets and tamarins
(Callitrichidae) are not only much smaller in body size, but also typically raise
multiple offspring during a relatively brief lactation. We hypothesized that
selection for small body size and high reproductive rate might favor secretion of
milk of higher energy and protein concentrations. To test this hypothesis, 46
milk samples collected from 10 common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus, ca. 350 g)
were assayed for dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP), fat, and sugar; and gross
energy (GE) was calculated from these constituents. We also assayed five samples 
collected from three golden lion tamarins (Leontopithecus rosalia, ca. 700 g) and
six samples collected from a single pygmy marmoset (Cebuella pygmaea, ca. 150 g) 
over two lactation periods. All samples were collected between days 10 and 57
post partum, representing mid lactation for these species. The milks of these
three species were similar, containing 14.0%, 16.1%, and 13.7% DM; 2.7%, 2.6%,
and 2.9% CP; 3.6%, 5.2%, and 3.7% fat; 7.4%, 7.2%, and 7.8% sugar; and 0.76,
0.90, and 0.82 kcal/g for common marmosets, golden lion tamarins, and the pygmy
marmoset, respectively. These species produced milks with energy values that were
within the range reported for large anthropoids, albeit with slightly higher
protein concentration. However, milk composition did vary substantially among
individual common marmoset females, especially in the proportion of milk energy
derived from fat. In contrast, CP as expressed as a percent of GE was remarkably 
constant among common marmoset females. Callitrichid milk appeared to be similar 
to that of larger anthropoid primates in GE, but was higher in CP and in the
proportion of GE from CP. However, the small sample sizes for the golden lion
tamarin and the pygmy marmoset, and the wide variation in milk composition found 
among common marmoset females cautions against definitively characterizing the
milks of callitrichids from these data.

The biosynthesis of oestrogens from androgens is catalysed by the aromatase
complex, an essential component of which is the aromatase cytochrome P450 (P450
arom) protein. Expression of a functional P450 arom is essential for normal
fertility in males and females and the sequence of the protein is highly
conserved. We have raised a new monoclonal antibody against a conserved peptide
and validated it on fixed tissue sections of the rat, common marmoset (Callthrix 
jacchus) and human. The monoclonal antibody was used successfully for Western
analysis and specifically reacted with a 55 kDa protein in microsomal extracts.
On sections of ovaries in all three species, expression in follicles was specific
to the mural granulosa cells of antral follicles and was present in corpora
lutea. In the human and marmoset, staining of luteal cells was markedly
heterogeneous and did not appear to vary consistently with the stage of the
cycle. The intensity of immunostaining was elevated in corpora lutea from
pregnant rats and following human chorionic gonadotropin rescue in the human. In 
the testis, the highest levels of expression were observed in the Leydig cells
within the interstitium. In adult rat and marmoset, and possibly also in the
human, some P450 arom was associated with the cytoplasm surrounding elongate
spermatids but other germ cells were immunonegative. In conclusion, a new
monoclonal antibody specific for P450 arom recognises the protein in rodent,
primate and human. Its ability to work on fixed tissue sections will facilitate
identification of individual cells expressing P450 arom within complex tissues.

Experimental allergic encephalomyelitis in the New World monkey Callithrix
jacchus.

Models that adequately reflect the complexity of human multiple sclerosis (MS)
are needed, especially for preclinical testing of immunomodulatory drugs. Our
group has created a unique experimental system in a New World outbred primate,
the common marmoset Callithrix jacchus (C. jacchus). Following immunization with 
myelin, these monkeys develop a chronic, relapsing-remitting form of experimental
allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), which pathologically recapitulates the hallmark
features of lesions of human MS. The MS-like lesion in C. jacchus results from a 
complex immune response against myelin antigens and requires both T cells and
pathogenic antibodies. Studies of C. jacchus EAE have permitted the
identification of a major target for pathogenic autoantibodies in MS, the
myelin/oligodendrocyte glycoprotein. Other advantages of the model include a
natural bone-marrow chimerism, which permits T-cell adoptive transfers between
siblings, and the possibility of using different antigens to produce either
inflammatory or demyelinating phenotypes of EAE. Despite their small size,
sequential in vivo imaging and immunological studies are possible in these
monkeys, and have been used to monitor efficacy in preclinical trials. Due to
close phylogeny and high homology of immune and nervous system genes with humans,
this model should fast-track the development of novel therapeutics for MS.

Netherlands. brok@bprc.nl

New World monkeys are valuable animal models to study human diseases. To
determine the phenotype of cells involved in immune responses, we used flow
cytometry to screen a large panel of anti-human monoclonal antibodies (mAb) for
cross-reactivity with cells of the common marmoset and the cotton-top tamarin.
Certain antigens (e.g., CD2, CD8, CD20) are well conserved. However, CD10, CD23, 
and CD33 showed a clear discrepancy in their reaction patterns in both species,
indicating that significant differences on the epitope level occurred during
evolution. Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B-cell lines were shown to be a
valuable tool for screening B-cell-specific reagents. In some cases, fluorescein 
isothiocyanate (FITC) and phycoerythrin (PE) modification of mAbs had a negative 
effect on the binding capacity, which stressed the importance of choosing the
right label. Despite the fact that some CD antigens were not detected, adequate
numbers of cross-reactive mAbs were identified to perform extensive studies on
immunological functions in both the common marmoset and the cotton-top tamarin.

Investigation of the sleep electrocorticogram of the common marmoset (Callithrix 
jacchus) using radiotelemetry.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the use of a totally implantable radiotelemetry system for
recording the sleep electrocorticogram (ECoG) of a small new world primate, the
common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) without restraint during data collection.
METHODS: Under anaesthesia a telemetry transmitter, which allowed the recording
of a single ECoG channel, was implanted intraperitoneally. This system allowed
ECoG data to be recorded overnight from animals living in pairs within their
habitual laboratory environment over a period of 12 months. Data were
subsequently scored using modified Rechtschaffen and Kales criteria (A manual of 
standardized terminology, techniques and scoring system for sleep stages of human
subjects. Los Angeles, UCLA Brain Information Service/Brain Research Institute,
1968) into stages of waking, light sleep, deep sleep and probable rapid eye
movement sleep (pREM). Concurrent video recording was used to assist in the
categorising of pREM.
RESULTS: Results showed that, as in man, the marmoset exhibits sleep cycles with 
stages alternating between non-REM (deep sleep and light sleep) and pREM sleep
throughout the night. In common with other non-human primates the duration of
each of the sleep stages was relatively short and punctuated with frequent
waking.
CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that sleep in marmosets housed under laboratory
conditions (a) can be recorded without restraint and (b) has potential to be used
as a model for human sleep.

The neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) has been shown
to induce parkinsonism in man and non-human primates. Monoamine-oxidase B (MAO-B)
has been reported to be implicated in both MPTP-induced parkinsonism and
Parkinson's disease, since selegiline (L-deprenyl), an irreversible MAO-B
inhibitor, prevents MPTP-induced neurotoxicity in numerous species including
mice, goldfish and drosophyla. However, one disadvantage of this substance
relates to its metabolism to (-)-methamphetamine and (-)-amphetamine. Rasagiline 
(R-(+)-N-propyl-1-aminoindane) is a novel irrevesible MAO-B-inhibitor, which is
not metabolized to metamphetamine and/or amphetamine. The present study compared 
the effects of high doses of selegiline and rasagiline (10 mg/kg body weight
s.c.) on MPTP-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity in a non-human primate
(Callithrix jacchus) model of PD. Groups of four monkeys were assigned to the
following six experimental groups: Group I: Saline, Group II: Selegiline/Saline, 
Group III: Rasagiline/Saline, Group IV: MPTP/Saline, Group V: Rasagiline/MPTP,
Group VI: Selegiline/MPTP. Daily treatment with MAO-B-inhibitors (either
rasagiline or selegiline, 10 mg/kg body weight s.c.) was initiated four days
prior to MPTP-exposure (MPTP-HCl, 2 mg/kg body weight subcutaneously, separated
by an interval of 24 hours for a total of four days) and was continued until the 
end of the experiment, i.e. 7 days after the cessation of the MPTP-injections,
when animals were sacrificed. MPTP-treatment caused distinct behavioural,
histological, and biochemical alterations: 1. significant reduction of motor
activity assessed by clinical rating and by computerized locomotor activity
measurements; 2. substantial loss (approx. 40%) of dopaminergic
(tyrosine-hydroxylase-positive) cells in the substantia nigra, pars compacta; and
3. putaminal dopamine depletion of 98% and its metabolites DOPAC (88%) and HVA
(96%). Treatment with either rasagiline or selegiline markedly attenuated the
neurotoxic effects of MPTP at the behavioural, histological, and at the
biochemical levels. There were no significant differences between rasagiline/MPTP
and selegiline/MPTP-treated animals in respect to signs of motor impairment, the 
number of dopaminergic cells in the substantia nigra, and striatal dopamine
levels. As expected, both inhibitors decreased the metabolism of dopamine,
leading to reduced levels of HVA and DOPAC (by >95% and 45% respectively). In
conclusion, rasagiline and selegiline at the dosages employed equally protect
against MPTP-toxicity in the common marmoset, suggesting that selegiline-derived 
metabolites are not important for the neuroprotective effects of high dose
selegiline in the non-human MPTP-primate model in the experimental design
employed. However, unexpectedly, high dose treatment with both MAO-inhibitors
caused a decrease of the cell sizes of nigral tyrosine hydroxylase positive
neurons. It remains to be determined, if this histological observation represents
potential adverse effects of high dose treatment with monoamine oxidase
inhibitors.

Characterization of the expressed immunoglobulin IGHV repertoire in the New World
marmoset Callithrix jacchus.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus jacchus) is a member of the
Callithrichinae, a family of outbred New World primates with limited MHC
polymorphisms and a propensity to develop spontaneous or experimentally induced
autoimmunity. C. jacchus marmosets are susceptible to experimental allergic
encephalomyelitis (EAE), and spontaneously develop autoimmune colitis and
thyroiditis. Such disease models approximate the complexity of human autoimmune
disorders, and allow an investigation of the respective roles of T-cell and
antibody responses to self-antigens in outbred species. A key issue for further
definition of the pathogenic antibody responses in human autoimmunity is to
understand the diversity of the immunoglobulin repertoire in primate models.
Here, we characterized the expressed immunoglobulin IGHV repertoire of the C.
jacchus marmoset. Six IGHV subgroups were identified which show a high degree of 
sequence similarity to their human IGHV counterparts (IGHV1, IGHV3, IGHV4, IGHV5,
IGHV6, and IGHV7). As in the expressed human IGHV repertoire, the framework
regions are more conserved when compared to the complementarity-determining
regions (CDRs), with the greatest degree of variability located in CDR3.
Predicted structural features are highly conserved between C. jacchus and human
IGHV. This information now provides a framework for studies of the
antigen-specific repertoire of pathogenic antibodies in EAE and other
immune-mediated diseases.

Comparison of androgen receptor and oestrogen receptor beta immunoexpression in
the testes of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) from birth to adulthood:
low androgen receptor immunoexpression in Sertoli cells during the neonatal
increase in testosterone concentrations.

The aims of this study were: (i) to investigate the cellular immunoexpression of 
androgen receptor and oestrogen receptor beta in the testes of the common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) during neonatal life compared with their expression
at later ages; (ii) to establish whether neonatal marmoset Sertoli cells are
targets for androgens or oestrogens or both; and (iii) to investigate the
relationship between neonatal plasma testosterone concentrations and androgen
receptor immunoexpression by abolishing the neonatal testosterone surge with a
potent GnRH antagonist. Androgen receptor and oestrogen receptor beta
immunoexpression were evaluated in neonatal animals aged 1-4 days, 4 weeks and 6 
weeks, and compared with immunoexpression in animals aged 18-22 weeks (early
infancy), 35 weeks (late infancy), 58-62 weeks (late pubertal) and > 100 weeks
(adult). Immunoexpression of androgen receptor in the reproductive tract was also
evaluated at each age. Sertoli cell immunoexpression of androgen receptor was
weak or absent in neonatal animals, but increased substantially in infant
animals, reaching adult levels by the end of infancy. In contrast,
immunoexpression of androgen receptor during the neonatal period was strong in
testicular interstitial cells and very strong in epithelial cell nuclei
throughout the reproductive tract, and did not change greatly with age in these
cells or tissues. Similarly, immunoexpression of oestrogen receptor beta was
prominent in many Sertoli cells and in the germ cells of neonatal animals, and
was relatively constant throughout life. Weak immunoexpression of androgen
receptor in neonatal Sertoli cells was associated with high plasma testosterone
concentrations (2.7-5.5 ng ml(-1)), whereas strong Sertoli cell immunoexpression 
was associated with baseline (approximately 0.12 ng ml(-1)) testosterone
concentrations in infant animals and with > 10 ng ml(-1) in late pubertal and
adult animals. Immunoexpression of androgen receptor and oestrogen receptor beta 
was also evaluated in co-twin males aged 4 and 35 weeks, after treatment from
birth to 4 weeks or from week 25 to week 35, respectively, with either vehicle or
with GnRH antagonist at a dose known to suppress the neonatal testosterone surge 
completely. Only GnRH antagonist treatment during weeks 25-35 reduced androgen
receptor immunoexpression, whereas immunoexpression of oestrogen receptor beta
was unaffected by treatment during either period. On the basis of these findings 
it is suggested that: (i) neonatal marmoset Sertoli cells may be targets
primarily for oestrogens rather than androgens; (ii) androgen receptor expression
in the testes of neonatal and infant marmosets is not regulated in a
straightforward way by testosterone; and (iii) high neonatal concentrations of
plasma testosterone are not absolutely necessary for expression of androgen
receptor in marmoset testes at this time.

Differential effects of 6-OHDA lesions of the frontal cortex and caudate nucleus 
on the ability to acquire an attentional set.

Evidence from both human and animal studies indicates that catecholamine
(dopamine and noradrenaline) imbalances in the fronto-striatal circuitry are
associated with deficits in higher- order cognitive functions. The present study 
examined how catecholamines within this circuitry modulate attentional function, 
specifically the ability to develop, maintain, and shift an attentional set.
Catecholamine depletions within the frontal cortex of the common marmoset
impaired the ability to acquire an attentional set, and increased susceptibility 
to distraction from task-irrelevant stimuli. Analysis of set-shifting performance
with stimulus dimensions of varying salience suggested that frontal catecholamine
depletion selectively disrupts "top-down", but not "bottom-up" attentional
processing. In contrast, the ability to acquire and shift an attentional set
remained intact following dopaminergic depletion from the caudate nucleus.
However, the reduced susceptibility to distraction from task-irrelevant stimuli
displayed by monkeys with dopaminergic depletions of the caudate nucleus suggests
that responding was under more rigid control by the currently rewarded stimulus. 
The results demonstrate opposite behavioural effects of 6-hydroxydopamine
(6-OHDA) lesions in the frontal cortex and caudate nucleus in tasks requiring
selective attention. Frontal catecholamine depletion caused an increase in
distractibility while caudate dopamine loss induced greater focusing of
responding.

Conditioned reinforcement refers to the capacity of a conditioned stimulus to
support instrumental behavior by acquiring affective properties of the primary
reinforcer with which it is associated. Conditioned reinforcers maintain behavior
over protracted periods of time in the absence of, and potentially in conflict
with, primary reinforcers and as such may play a fundamental role in complex
social behavior. A relatively large body of evidence supports the view that the
amygdala (and in particular the basolateral area) contributes to conditioned
reinforcement by maintaining a representation of the affective value of
conditioned stimuli. However, a recent study in primates (Malkova et al., 1997), 
using a second-order visual discrimination task, suggests that the amygdala is
not critical for the conditioned reinforcement process. In the present study,
excitotoxic lesions of the amygdala in a new world primate, the common marmoset, 
resulted in a progressive impairment in responding under a second-order schedule 
of food reinforcement. In addition, the responding of amygdala-lesioned animals
was insensitive to the omission of the conditioned reinforcer, unlike that of
control animals, for which responding was markedly reduced. In contrast, lesioned
animals were unimpaired when responding on a progression of fixed-ratio schedules
of primary reinforcement. These data confirm that the amygdala is critical for
the conditioned reinforcement process in primates, and taken together with other 
recent work in monkeys, these results suggest that the contribution of the
amygdala is to provide the affective value of specific reinforcers as accessed by
associated conditioned stimuli.

Inhibition of CD40-CD40 ligand interaction is a potentially effective approach
for treatment of autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis. We have
investigated this concept with a chimeric antagonist anti-human CD40 mAb (ch5D12)
in the marmoset monkey experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model.
Marmosets were immunized with recombinant human myelin oligodendrocyte
glycoprotein (rMOG) and treated from the day before immunization (day -1) until
day 50 with either ch5D12 (5 mg/kg every 2-4 days) or placebo. On day 41 after
the induction of EAE, four of four placebo-treated monkeys had developed severe
clinical EAE, whereas all animals from the ch5D12-treated group were completely
free of disease symptoms. High serum levels of ch5D12 associated with complete
coating of CD40 on circulating B cells were found. At necropsy placebo- and
ch5D12-treated animals showed similar MOG-specific lymphoproliferative responses 
in vitro, but ch5D12 treatment resulted in strongly reduced anti-MOG IgM Ab
responses and delayed anti-MOG IgG responses. Most importantly, treatment with
ch5D12 prevented intramolecular spreading of epitope recognition. Postmortem
magnetic resonance imaging and immunohistologic analysis of the CNS showed a
markedly reduced lesion load after ch5D12 treatment. In conclusion, the strong
reduction of clinical, pathological, and radiological aspects of EAE by ch5D12
treatment in this preclinical model points to a therapeutic potential of this
engineered antagonist anti-CD40 mAb for multiple sclerosis.

Bipolar cell diversity in the primate retina: morphologic and immunocytochemical 
analysis of a new world monkey, the marmoset Callithrix jacchus.

University of Sydney, Sydney 2006, Australia.

The aim of this study was to identify the bipolar cell types in the retina of a
New World monkey, the common marmoset, and compare them with those found in the
Old World macaque monkey. Retinal whole-mounts, sections, or both, were stained
by using DiI labeling and immunohistochemical methods. Semithin sections were
analyzed by using quantitative methods. We show that the same morphologic types
of bipolar cell as described for the Old World macaque monkey by Boycott and
Wässle (Boycott and Wässle [1991] Eur. J. Neurosci. 3:1069-1088) are present in
marmoset retina: two types of midget bipolar cells, six type of diffuse bipolar
cells, a blue cone bipolar cell, and one type of rod bipolar cell. The pattern of
staining with different immunohistochemical markers ("fingerprint") of each
bipolar cell type in marmoset was also the same as described for macaque, with
one exception: the flat midget bipolar cell (FMB) class is labeled by antibodies 
to recoverin in macaque but is labeled by antibodies to CD15 in marmoset. The
labeled FMB cells in marmoset make contact with multiple cone photoreceptors
throughout most of the extrafoveal retina. The spatial density of bipolar cells
in marmoset is shown to be sufficient to support one-to-one connectivity of
midget bipolar and ganglion cells in the fovea and to allow for parallel pathways
to ganglion cells throughout the retina. Quantitative differences in the
morphology and receptor connectivity between marmoset and macaque can be related 
to differences in cone and rod photoreceptor density between the species. We
conclude that bipolar cell diversity is a preserved feature of the primate
retina.

Antiparkinsonian activity and dyskinesia risk of ropinirole and L-DOPA
combination therapy in drug naïve MPTP-lesioned common marmosets (Callithrix
jacchus).

De novo administration of long-acting dopamine agonists, such as ropinirole, to
patients with Parkinson's disease or to
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated subhuman primates
produces a lower incidence of dyskinesia than occurs with L-DOPA. This study
compares the intensity of dyskinesia produced by combinations of L-DOPA and
ropinirole and by these drugs alone, using the MPTP-treated common marmoset model
of Parkinson's disease. The objective is to determine the optimum therapeutic
strategy for the long-term control of Parkinson's disease with a minimal risk of 
dyskinesia. MPTP-treated marmosets received either L-DOPA alone, ropinirole
alone, or one of two combinations of these drugs (either L-DOPA dominant or
ropinirole dominant) daily for 28 days in doses titrated to produce a similar
improvement in disability and increase in locomotion. In the group receiving
L-DOPA alone, there was a trend for peak dose locomotor activity to increase and 
the duration of drug effect to decline over the period of the study. L-DOPA alone
induced marked dyskinesia over the period of treatment, in contrast to ropinirole
which produced a low intensity of involuntary movements. The L-DOPA dominant
combination initially produced little dyskinesia, but this became increasingly
intense as the study progressed. In contrast, the ropinirole dominant combination
produced no greater intensity of dyskinesia than was produced by ropinirole
alone. These data suggest that in early Parkinson's disease, the use of
ropinirole alone or in combination with a low-dose L-DOPA might delay the
induction of dyskinesias while improving motor performance.

Olfactory cues can elicit intense emotional responses. This study used fMRI in
male common marmoset monkeys to identify brain areas associated with sexual
arousal in response to odors of ovulating female monkeys. Under light anesthesia,
monkeys were secured in a specially designed restrainer and positioned in a 9.4 T
magnetic resonance spectrometer. When fully conscious, they were presented with
the scents of both ovariectomized and ovulating monkeys. The sexually arousing
odors of the ovulating monkeys enhanced signal intensity in the preoptic area and
anterior hypothalamus compared to the odors of ovariectomized monkeys. These data
corroborate previous findings in monkeys based on invasive electrical lesion and 
stimulation techniques and demonstrate the feasibility of using non-invasive
functional imaging on fully conscious common marmosets to study cue-elicited
emotional responses.

Female marmoset monkeys (Callithrix jacchus) can be identified from the chemical

The present study analyzed 42 organic solvent extracts of scent mark pools from
five dominant female common marmosets by gas chromatography (GC) and combined GC 
and mass spectrometry. We determined whether there were qualitative or
quantitative differences between the chemical composition of scent marks from
individual females. Gas chromatography and mass spectral analysis detected the
same 162 chemicals in 86% (36/42) of scent mark pools from five dominant females.
This near identical chemical composition of scent marks suggested there were few,
if any, qualitative differences between the chemical composition of scent marks
from individual females. Instead, quantitative differences in scent may provide
the key factor distinguishing individual females. Using the relative
concentration of highly volatile chemicals detected by GC in scent marks, linear 
discriminant analysis classified scent mark pools to their correct donor
approximately 91% of the time. Such highly reliable statistical matching of scent
to donor suggested that each individual female common marmoset has a unique ratio
of highly volatile chemicals in their scent marks which may permit individual
identification of females from odors in their scent alone.

To establish a new non-human primate model for human cytokine and gene therapy,
we characterized lymphocytes and haematopoietic progenitor cells of the small New
World monkey, the common marmoset. We first assessed the reactions of marmoset
bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) cells to mouse anti-human monoclonal
antibodies (mAbs) for the purpose of isolating marmoset lymphocytes and
haematopoietic progenitor cells. Both cell fractions stained with CD4 and CD8
mAbs were identified as lymphocytes by cell proliferation assay and morphological
examination. Myeloid-specific mAbs such as CD14 and CD33 did not react with
marmoset BM and PB cells. No available CD34 and c-kit mAbs could be used to
purify the marmoset haematopoietic progenitor cells. Furthermore, we studied the 
in vitro transduction of the bacterial beta-galactosidase (LacZ) gene into CFU-GM
derived from marmoset BM using retroviral and adenoviral vectors. The
transduction efficiency was increased by using a mixed culture system consisting 
of marmoset BM stromal cells and retroviral producer cells. It was also possible 
to transduce LacZ gene into marmoset haematopoietic progenitor cells with
adenoviral vectors as well as retroviral vectors. The percentage of adenovirally 
transduced LacZ-positive clusters was 15% at day 4 (multiplicity of
infection=200), but only 1-2% at day 14. The differential use of viral vector
systems is to be recommended in targeting different diseases. Our results
suggested that marmoset BM progenitor cells were available to examine the
transduction efficiency of various viral vectors in vitro.

The genetic basis of red-green color vision of common marmoset (Callithrix
jacchus) is not fully understood. Here, we have cloned and characterized the
three alleles at a locus that encode the long to middle wavelength-sensitive
(LWS/MWS) visual pigments of this species. Using in situ hybridization, we
localized this locus to the telomeric region of the long arm of X chromosome. The
three visual pigments achieve the wavelengths of maximal absorption at 561, 553, 
and 539 nm and fully explain the red-green color vision of the common marmoset.
The 'tri-allelic single-locus X-chromosome' model operates under the unique
phenomenon, known as blood chimerism.

Mealworm feeders as environmental enrichment for common marmosets.

Human Development, National Institutes of Health, Poolesville, Maryland 20837,
USA.

The impact of a foraging enrichment device, the "mealworm feeder," on the
behavior of the common marmoset was examined. In 3-h weekly exposures to the
wormfeeder device, behavioral observations were conducted to compare the rates of
feeder use, use of other enrichment devices, stereotyped behavior, and
inactivity, to those of control sessions in which the enrichment device was not
provided. Significantly decreased rates of pacing and time spent sitting still
were observed in association with placement of the mealworm feeder. Feeder use
declined over a period of 3 h, even if the feeders' contents were not fully
depleted, and the effects of enrichment on activity waned in a like fashion. Use 
of other enrichment devices, comprised primarily of cage furniture, increased in 
the presence of the mealworm feeder. This effect did not change significantly
over the 3 h of exposure even though use of the feeder declined. There was
significant variation in feeder use among sex and housing condition, with females
housed singly and in peer groups using the feeders significantly more than did
males, whereas subadults used the feeder significantly more often than did either
the dominant female or male in family groups. The results of this study suggest
that the mealworm feeder is an effective form of environmental enrichment for the
common marmoset, but interest wanes after approximately 3 h.

The selection of marmoset monkeys (Callithrix jacchus) in pharmaceutical
toxicology.

Smith D(1), Trennery P, Farningham D, Klapwijk J.

Author information: 
(1)Safety Assessment UK, AstraZeneca, Macclesfield, Cheshire.

Prior to controlled clinical trials in human volunteers or patients it is
required that novel pharmaceuticals are evaluated for pre-clinical safety in a
rodent and a non-rodent ('second') species. In most cases the rodent species used
has been the rat and the second species has been the dog or macaque (usually
cynomolgus or rhesus) monkey. However, there is an increasing trend within the
United Kingdom (UK) pharmaceutical industry to use the common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus) for pre-clinical toxicology programmes. This paper examines 
the practicality of using the common marmoset (henceforth referred to as 'the
marmoset') in toxicological testing and reviews metabolic and pharmacodynamic
similarities between this species and humans. It then discusses some of the
advantages and disadvantages of the use of this species when compared with two
other alternatives to the dog and macaque, namely the ferret and minipig. In
particular, the marmoset has clear advantages over the macaque in terms of animal
welfare and practicality. There is regulatory acceptance of this species for
Investigational New Drug (IND), Clinical Trial Exemption (CTX), New Drug
Application (NDA) and Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) registrations.
Whilst the dog is likely to be maintained as the primary non-rodent species in
toxicology, the marmoset has been, and will likely continue to be, adopted as an 
additional non-rodent species in pre-clinical toxicology programmes where
appropriate.

Coadministration of (-)-OSU6162 with l-DOPA normalizes preproenkephalin mRNA
expression in the sensorimotor striatum of primates with unilateral 6-OHDA
lesions.

Pirker W(1), Tedroff J, Pontén H, Gunne L, Andrén PE, Hurd YL.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Karolinska Hospital, Stockholm, S-17176, 
Sweden.

The substituted phenylpiperidine (-)-OSU6162 is a novel modulator of the
dopaminergic systems with low affinity for dopamine D(2) receptors and potent
normalizing effects on l-DOPA-induced dyskinesias. We studied the effects of
coadministration of (-)-OSU6162 with l-DOPA on the regulation of striatal
preproenkephalin (PPE) and prodynorphin (PDyn) mRNA expression in the primate
brain by in situ hybridization histochemistry. Common marmoset monkeys sustaining
unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesions of the nigrostriatal pathway received
l-DOPA/carbidopa, l-DOPA/carbidopa plus (-)-OSU6162, or vehicle over 14 days. In 
vehicle-treated animals, PPE mRNA levels were markedly increased in the
sensorimotor territory of the lesioned striatum. By contrast, a rather uniform
lesion-induced reduction of PDyn mRNA levels was found in the vehicle group.
Subchronic l-DOPA treatment induced a further increase in PPE mRNA expression in 
a number of sensorimotor and associative subregions of the denervated striatum.
Coadministration of (-)-OSU6162 with l-DOPA partially reversed the lesion- and
l-DOPA-induced elevation of PPE expression and, by affecting PPE mRNA expression 
differentially on the intact and lesioned striatum, markedly reduced the
side-to-side difference in PPE mRNA expression. The effects on PPE mRNA
expression were apparent throughout the rostrocaudal extent of the putamen and
the dorsal portions of the caudate nucleus. l-DOPA treatment resulted in an
enhancement in PDyn mRNA expression in all functional compartments of the
striatum. Coadministration of (-)-OSU6162 had no apparent influence on these
l-DOPA-induced changes in PDyn mRNA expression. The present results suggest that 
(-)-OSU6162 acts primarily by modifying striatal output via the indirect pathway.

Visual agnosia and Klüver-Bucy syndrome in marmosets (Callithrix jacchus)
following ablation of inferotemporal cortex, with additional mnemonic effects of 
immunotoxic lesions of cholinergic projections to medial temporal areas.

Medicine, Madingley Road, CB3 0ES, Cambridge, UK. rmr21@cam.ac.uk

Inferotemporal ablations in the New World monkey, the common marmoset (Callithrix
jacchus), produced a persistent impairment on visual discrimination learning and 
a florid, but transient, Klüver-Bucy syndrome. Monkeys with these ablations were 
impaired on acquisition of object discriminations to a high criterion and on
concurrent discrimination learning, to a single high criterion across all trials.
Neither the control monkeys nor the monkeys with inferotemporal ablations found
acquisition more difficult when the component discriminations of a set were
presented concurrently compared to consecutively, although the monkeys with
inferotemporal ablations found acquisition under both these conditions somewhat
more difficult than did control monkeys. This suggests that the severe impairment
caused by inferotemporal ablations on concurrent learning measured across all
trials is due to the need for sustained performance across a concurrent set
rather than to the extra mnemonic demands of concurrent presentation. When
immunotoxic lesions of the cholinergic projection to the hippocampal formation
were added to the inferotemporal ablations, a further impairment on retention,
and a differential impairment on concurrent, compared to consecutive, learning
was observed. Previous studies have shown that lesions of the cholinergic
projection to the hippocampus alone, or excitotoxic hippocampal lesions, do not
affect simple visual discrimination learning. It is suggested that large
inferotemporal ablations in monkeys produce a visual agnosia which causes severe 
'psychic blindness' in the first instance, and a persistent impairment on visual 
discrimination learning. The hippocampus makes a contribution, which may be
mnemonic, to discrimination performance after inferotemporal ablations.

Localization of estrogen and progesterone receptors in the endometrium of common 
marmosets Callithrix jacchus.

400 012, India.

In the present study, changes in the immunohistochemical localization of
endometrial estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) during various 
stages of the ovarian cyclicity in common marmoset, have been reported. Ovarian
cyclicity was monitored by estimating plasma estradiol and progesterone. During
the early follicular phase, weak ER immunolocalization was observed in the
endometrial stroma. During the late follicular phase under the influence of
rising estradiol levels, stromal ER localization was intense. During the luteal
phase, ER localization was absent in the stroma indicating that high
concentrations of progesterone suppressed ER. PR localization was not observed in
the stroma during the early follicular phase, while weak staining was seen in the
stroma during the late follicular phase. PR localization was maximum during the
mid luteal phase. However in marmoset, endometrial ER and PR localization was
restricted only to the stroma. This unique feature may be due to the
characteristic reproductive profile of this nonmenstruating species and needs to 
be studied further. Thus it can be hypothesized that in the marmoset endometrium,
steroid hormone mediated effects possibly occur directly in the stroma and are
then transmitted to the epithelium by autocrine/paracrine action of growth
factors and cytokines.

Increased ACTH and cortisol secretion after interleukin-alpha injection in the
common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus jacchus).

We have studied the effect of intravenous injection of interleukin-1 (dose range:
from 0.25 to 4.5 microg/kg of body weight) on plasma ACTH and cortisol levels in 
the marmoset, a primate paradygm of peripheral glucocorticoid resistance. Blood
sampling were collected and body temperature recorded 0, 15, 30, 60, 120, 180,
240 and 300 min after injection. Interleukin-1 stimulated secretion of ACTH in a 
dose-dependent fashion. Maximal secretion occurred 120 min after injection, and
lasted up to 240 min. Plasma ACTH levels returned to baseline 300 min after
interleukin-1 injection. Plasma cortisol levels were related to ACTH levels. Body
temperature elevation, which occurred 10-15 min after injection was
dose-dependent, and lasted 3 h. Results suggest that the pyrogenic effect of
interleukin is associated, in the marmoset, with integrated activation of the
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. In light of the proneness of marmosets to
hyperimmune disorders, our data are consistent with the hypothesized central
biological role of IL-1, as well as the pathophysiological relevance of the
neuro-endocrine-immune cross-talk during the acute phase response.

Intraretinal axon diameters of a New World primate, the marmoset (Callithrix
jacchus).

Walsh N(1), Ghosh KK, FitzGibbon T.

Author information: 
(1)Institute for Biomedical Research, Department of Physiology, University of
Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.

PURPOSE: Previously, measurements of retinal ganglion cell axon diameter have
been used to make inferences about the physiology and clinical pathology of the
visual pathway. However, few of these studies were able to unequivocally relate
axon diameter to retinal ganglion cell type and other associated measurements. In
this and our previous study we have examined intraretinal axon diameters to
determine if differences in axon diameter may help to explain conduction velocity
measurements found previously.
METHODS: Individual retinal ganglion cells of a New World primate, the common
marmoset (Collithrix jacchus) were injected iontophoretically with 2% Lucifer
yellow and 4% neurobiotin. Labelled cells were visualized by horseradish
peroxidase immunohistochemistry and diaminobenzidine and then retinae were
mounted vitreal side up on a glass slide. Cell measurements were made with the
aid of a camera lucida attachment and computer-aided morphometry Axons were
photographed under x 100 oil immersion and measured at a final magnification of x
4600.
RESULTS: A sample of 62 parasol cells, 22 midget cells, 16 hedge cells and 11
small bistratified cells were analysed. Dendritic field diameter of the different
cell classes showed only moderate (non-significant) increases with eccentricity. 
Only the parasol cells demonstrated a significant increase in mean axon diameter 
with eccentricity. When the parasol class was examined more closely, it was found
that only parasol cells of the superior, inferior and temporal retina (SIT group)
showed significant positive correlations between different cell parameters (mean 
axon diameter, soma diameter, dendritic field diameter, eccentricity). Soma and
dendritic field diameters of the SIT group were significantly larger than those
of the nasal parasol cells. However, mean axon diameters of the SIT cells were
not significantly different from nasal parasol cells. Axon diameters of nasal
parasol cells were very variable and overlapped those of the midget and hedge
cell classes to a large extent.
CONCLUSIONS: The present data show that for marmoset parasol cells there may not 
be a clearly defined distinction between nasal and superior, inferior and
temporal parasol cells on the basis of axon size. Of particular interest in the
present analysis is the clear separation of superior, inferior and temporal
parasol cells and nasal parasol cells when comparing soma and dendritic field
diameters which is not reflected in the distribution of axon diameters. We
suggest that changes in diameter along the length of an axon, differences between
retinal quadrants and the variability between cells may be related to
minimization of spatiotemporal dispersion necessary for accurate perception of
motion within the visual world.

Gross and microscopic anatomy of the extraorbital lacrimal gland of the common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).

Author information: 
(1)Mitsubishi Chemical Safety Institute Ltd., Ibaraki-ken, Japan.

PURPOSE: The lacrimal gland is often selected for microscopic examination in
toxicologic studies. However, this gland is difficult to find within the orbit in
marmosets at necropsy. Therefore, we examined the extraorbital lacrimal glands in
marmosets.
METHODS: The formalin-fixed craniums of four marmosets were used in a topographic
study to confirm location of the lacrimal gland, and the results were applied to 
a routine toxicologic study in marmosets.
RESULTS: The extraorbital lacrimal gland was located on the temporal surface of
the zygomaticofrontal process and was covered with the temporalis muscle. The
gland was easily detached from the surrounding tissue, and its histologic
features were the same as those of the intraorbital lacrimal gland.
CONCLUSIONS: The extraorbital lacrimal glands have been reported in some New
World monkeys, but to the authors' knowledge, this is the first report in
marmosets. Identification and characterization of this gland will be useful for

The common marmoset Callithrix jacchus (C. jacchus) is an outbred species
characterized by a naturally occurring bone marrow chimerism and susceptibility
to a form of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) resembling multiple 
sclerosis (MS). T cell clones specific for the myelin antigen, myelin basic
protein (MBP), can be derived from both naive and immunized marmosets and can
adoptively transfer EAE to compatible chimeric siblings. Here, we demonstrate
that several different antigenic determinants of MBP are recognized by these
encephalitogenic T cell clones. Furthermore, PCR-based analysis of TCR Vbeta
families does not show the preferential usage of any gene segment.
Characterization of third complementarity determining regions (CDR3) fails to
demonstrate a recurring motif characteristic of the T cell immune response to MBP
in this species. Nevertheless, brief amino acid motifs are shared among marmoset 
clones and CDR3 sequences from MS samples. These data suggest that, due to its
outbred condition, the C. jacchus marmoset mounts a diverse pathogenic response
to MBP. However, the findings that certain CDR3 sequences are identically
expressed in different animals, or by different T cell clones, suggest that
MBP-specific T cell populations may be clonally expanded following chronic
antigenic stimulation in vivo.

Callithrix jacchus, the common marmoset, is particularly suitable for
immunological studies in vivo and in vitro since many antibodies directed against
epitopes of human cells do also react with their analogues from this non-human
primate. We studied the reactivity of antibodies against human epitopes on
primary cultures of thymic epithelial cells from marmosets and humans by
flow-cytometry after different culture periods. The antibodies against integrins,
including CD61, reacted with thymic epithelial cells from both humans and
marmosets, as did anti-CD44 and anti-CD106. Antibodies specific for thymic
epithelial cells (TE-3, TE-4, TE-8, TE-15, TE-16, TE-19) also bound to cells from
marmosets but expression of all epitopes was not observed in all cultures
studied. The expression of CD51, CD54, CD58 and CD106 on human cells declined
after 4 weeks of culture. Our findings indicate that marmosets are a valuable
model for immunological studies of effects of xenobiotics on the thymic
epithelium.

The common marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus) was used as a primate model for
the study of the expression of the estradiol synthesizing enzymes
17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 and type 7 (17HSD1 and 17HSD7). The
tissue-specific expression of 17HSD1 and 17HSD7 mRNA in Callithrix jacchus and
human as shown by Northern Blot analysis revealed strong similarities between the
two species. After cloning of the marmoset-specific coding cDNA sequence of
17HSD7 a similarity of 95% to the known human sequences was found. To elucidate
the physiological function of 17HSD7 which is thought to be different to that of 
the well-known 17HSD1, the regulation of 17HSD7 expression in the corpus luteum
was investigated. It was shown to be upregulated during the luteal phase of the
reproductive cycle and during early pregnancy, when the primate corpus luteum is 
most active in estradiol synthesis, whereas 17HSD1 was not detectable in this
tissue at any time.

Sequence and diversity of DRB genes of Aotus nancymaae, a primate model for human
malaria parasites.

The New World primate Aotus nancymaae is susceptible to infection with the human 
malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax and has therefore
been recommended by the World Health Organization as a model for evaluation of
malaria vaccine candidates. We present here a first step in the molecular
characterization of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II DRB genes
of Aotus nancymaae (owl monkey or night monkey) by nucleotide sequence analysis
of the polymorphic exon 2 segments. In a group of 15 nonrelated animals
captivated in the wild, 34 MHC DRB alleles could be identified. Six allelic
lineages were detected, two of them having human counterparts, while two other
lineages have not been described in any other New World monkey species studied.
As in the common marmoset, the diversity of DRB alleles appears to have arisen
largely by point mutations in the beta-pleated sheets and by frequent exchange of
fixed sequence motifs in the alpha-helical portion. Pairs of alleles differing
only at amino acid position b86 by an exchange of valine to glycine are present
in Aotus, as in humans. Essential amino acid residues contributing to MHC DR
peptide binding pockets number 1 and 4 are conserved or semiconserved between
HLA-DR and Aona-DRB molecules, indicating a capacity to bind similar peptide
repertoires. These results support fully our using Aotus monkeys as an animal
model for evaluation of future subunit vaccine candidates.

Influence of contrast on the responses of marmoset lateral geniculate cells to
drifting gratings.

The responses of lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) cells in the common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus) to drifting luminance or cone isolating gratings of
different spatial frequencies and contrasts were measured. The response noise,
defined as the variability of the responses to single sweeps in the complex
plane, was independent of stimulus contrast and spatial frequency but increased
with increasing overall responsiveness of the cell. The signal-to-noise ratio of 
parvocellular (PC) cells was smaller than of magnocellular (MC) cells. At each
contrast, the response amplitude as a function of spatial frequency could be
described with a difference of Gaussians model. With this model, the sizes and
the peak sensitivities of the receptive field centers and surrounds were
estimated. It was found that receptive field center and surround sizes of LGN
cells decrease slightly with increasing contrast. Further, the peak sensitivity
decreases with increasing contrast. The two factors are involved in a decrease in
responsivity (the response per unit contrast) with increasing contrast which is
compatible to response saturation for low spatial frequency stimuli. PC cells did
not saturate as much to luminance stimuli although some saturation was found with
cone isolating gratings. We found that the response phase lag of both PC and MC
cells decreased with increasing contrast, which cannot be explained on the basis 
of linear response behavior. Apparently the phase of LGN cell responses to
drifting gratings is altered in comparison with the retinal inputs by additional 
nonlinearities.

Changes in follicle-stimulating hormone and follicle populations during the
ovarian cycle of the common marmoset.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) belongs to the family Callitrichidae,
the only anthropoid primates with a high and variable number of ovulations (one
to four). An understanding of folliculogenesis in this species may provide some
insight into factors regulating multiple follicular growth in primates. The aims 
of this study were to characterize in detail changes in the antral follicle
population at different stages of the ovarian cycle, to characterize the marmoset
FSH profile, and to relate cyclic changes in FSH to changes in follicle sizes and
circulating estradiol concentrations. Fifty-five pairs of ovaries were collected 
(32 of which were at five distinct stages of the cycle) from adult marmosets, and
antral follicles were manually excised and separated into four size groups. Daily
urinary FSH and plasma estradiol and progesterone concentrations from Day 0 of
the follicular phase to 2 days postovulation were measured in 22 marmosets using 
enzyme immunoassays. The FSH profile revealed two distinct peaks, on Days 2 and
6, during the 10-day follicular phase, with a marginal periovulatory increase on 
Days 9 and 10. Estradiol levels rose significantly (P: < 0.05) above baseline
(Days 1-4) on Day 5 and continuously increased to a peak on the day preceding
ovulation (Days 8 and 9). Follicle dissection revealed a high (mean = 68) and
variable (range, 14-158) total number of antral follicles >0.6 mm. The number of 
antral follicles significantly declined (P: < 0.001) with age. The number of
preovulatory follicles (>2 mm) was positively correlated with the number of
antral follicles (P: < 0. 001) and tended to be negatively related to age (P: =
0.06). The number of antral follicles did not vary significantly with stage of
the ovarian cycle, although the follicle size distribution was cycle-stage
dependent (P: < 0.05). Follicles >1.0 mm appeared only in the follicular phase,
and preovulatory follicles (>2.0 mm) appeared only at the end of the follicular
phase (Days 7-9). The Day 2 FSH peak corresponded to emergence of a population of
medium-size antral follicles, and the Day 6 peak was consistent with rising
estradiol levels and appearance of the preovulatory follicles. These results
suggest that some aspects of marmoset folliculogenesis are comparable to those in
Old World primates, including the absence of multiple follicular waves and the
appearance of an identifiable dominant follicle in the midfollicular phase.
However, the midphase FSH peak, multiple dominant follicles, and abundance of
nonovulatory antral follicles differ strongly from the pattern in Old World
primates and humans. The findings are discussed in relation to the regulation of 
growth of multiple ovulatory follicles and provide the basis for further studies 
on factors influencing the dynamics of follicular growth and development in this 
species.

Quantitative analysis of spermatogenesis and apoptosis in the common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus) reveals high rates of spermatogonial turnover and high
spermatogenic efficiency.

Spermatogenesis is characterized by the succession in time and space of specific 
germ cell associations (stages). There can be a single stage (e.g., rodents and
some macaques) or more than one stage (e.g., chimpanzee and human) per tubular
cross section. We analyzed the organization of the seminiferous epithelium and
quantified testicular germ cell production and apoptosis in a New World primate, 
the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). Tubule cross sections contained more
than one stage, and the human six-stage system could be applied to marmoset
spermatogenesis. Stereological (optical disector) analysis (n = 5) revealed high 
spermatogenic efficiency during meiosis and no loss of spermatids during
spermiogenesis. The conversion of type A to type B spermatogonia was several-fold
higher than that reported for other primates. Highest apoptotic rates were found 
for S-phase cells (20%) and 4C cells (15%) by flow cytometric analysis (n = 6
animals); histological analysis confirmed spermatogonial apoptosis. Haploid germ 
cell apoptosis was <2%. Marmoset spermatogenesis is very efficient and involves
substantial spermatogonial proliferation. The prime determinants of germ cell
production in primates appear to be proliferation and survival of spermatogonia
rather than the efficiency of meiotic divisions. Based on the organizational
similarities, common marmosets could provide a new animal model for experimental 
studies of human spermatogenesis.

Alteration in the number of taste buds on the soft palate (SP), fungiform (FF),
foliate (FL) and circumvallate (CV) papillae in the common marmoset at different 
postnatal ages was examined histologically. After paraffin embedding, complete
serial sections at 10 microm thickness were made and stained by HE. Digitized
images for each section were examined carefully. The number of FF taste buds at
day 1 was 334. While only 20% of all the taste buds at birth possessed a taste
pore, 39% of 174 SP taste buds at day 1 possessed a taste pore. The number of
taste buds with pores at day 1 was small for the center CV (19 of 59), one side
CV (7 of 25), and one side FL (2 of 16). These results suggest that the
functional maturation of SP taste buds may precede maturation in other areas of
the tongue. The total number of taste buds increased with increasing age, reached
a maximum at 2 months of age: FF, 1069; SP, 609; CV-center, 530; CV-side, 390;
FL, 201, and decreased thereafter. Almost all taste buds possessed a taste pore
after 2 months of age. The decrease in the number of taste buds in the oral
cavity with increase in age may change taste sensitivity.

Photic and nonphotic circadian phase resetting in a diurnal primate, the common
marmoset.

Despite the considerable literature on circadian entrainment, there is little
information on this subject in diurnal mammals. Contributing to this lack of
understanding is the problem of separating photic from nonphotic (behavioral)
phase-resetting events in diurnal species. In the present study, photic phase
resetting was obtained in diurnal common marmosets held under constant dim light 
(DimDim; <0.5 lx) by using a 20-s pulse of bright light to minimize time
available for behavioral arousal. This stimulus elicited phase advances at
circadian time (CT) 18-22 and phase delays at CT9-12. Daily presentation of these
20-s pulses produced entrainment with a phase angle of approximately 11 h (0 h = 
activity onset). Nonphotic phase resetting was obtained under DimDim with the use
of a 1-h-induced activity pulse, consisting of intermittent cage agitation and
water sprinkling, delivered in total darkness to minimize photic effects. This
stimulus caused phase delays at CT20-24, and entrainment to a scheduled daily
regimen of these pulses occurred with a phase angle of approximately 0 h. These
results indicate that photic and nonphotic phase-response curves (PRCs) of
marmosets are similar to those of nocturnal rodents and that nonphotic PRCs are
keyed to the phase of the suprachiasmatic nucleus pacemaker, not to the phase of 
the activity-rest cycle.

Distribution of glycine receptor subunits on primate retinal ganglion cells: a
quantitative analysis.

Lin B(1), Martin PR, Solomon SG, Grünert U.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Physiology F13 and Institute for Biomedical Research, The
University of Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.

This study investigates the distribution of inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors
on sensory neurons. Ganglion cells in the retina of a New World monkey, the
common marmoset Callithrix jacchus, were injected with Lucifer yellow and
Neurobiotin and subsequently processed with antibodies against one (alpha1), or
against all subunits, of the glycine receptor, or against the anchoring protein
gephyrin. Immunoreactive (IR) puncta representing glycine receptor or gephyrin
clusters were found on the proximal and the distal dendrites of all ganglion cell
types investigated. For both parasol and midget cells, the density of receptor
clusters was greater on distal than proximal dendrites for all antibodies tested.
In parasol cells the average density for the alpha1 subunit of the glycine
receptor was 0.087 IR puncta/microm of dendrite, and for all subunits it was
0.119 IR puncta/microm of dendrite. Thus, the majority of glycine receptors on
parasol cells contain the alpha1 subunit. For parasol cells, we estimated an
average of 1.5 glycinergic synapses/100 microm2 dendritic membrane on proximal
dendrites and about 9.4 glycinergic synapses/100 microm2 on distal dendrites. The
segregation of receptors to the distal dendrites appears to be a common feature
of inhibitory neurotransmitter input to parasol and midget cells, and might be
associated with the receptive field surround mechanism.

The metabolic rate and vulnerability of dopaminergic neurons, and adenosine
dynamics in the cerebral cortex, nucleus accumbens, caudate nucleus, and putamen 
of the common marmoset.

The pathophysiology of the striatum and cerebral cortex were studied from the
pharmacological aspect. Investigation of the dopamine content in the cerebral
cortex revealed that the premotor and motor area showed the highest level
(61+/-6.2 ng/g). Intravenous injection of
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) at a dose of 10 mg/kg reduced
the dopamine content in the caudate nucleus and putamen to 2-3% of the control
level in common marmosets, while it fell to 60% in the nucleus accumbens. There
was no alteration of the dopamine content in the cerebral cortex.
Immunohistochemical staining for tyrosine hydroxylase in the midbrains of
MPTP-treated marmosets showed almost complete disappearance of dopaminergic cells
from the substantia nigra and good preservation of cells in the ventrotegmental
area. Dopaminergic cells projecting to the caudate/putamen, nucleus accumbens,
and cerebral cortex showed marked, moderate, and no vulnerability to MPTP,
respectively. After systemic administration of MPTP, dopaminergic neurons
projecting to the caudate nucleus and putamen were damaged equally. However, the 
compensatory increase of dopamine turnover was more prominent in the putamen than
in the caudate nucleus. Thus, nigroputaminal dopaminergic neurons may have a
higher level of activity than neurons in the caudate. The neural connections and 
functions of the caudate nucleus and putamen have already been differentiated
anatomically or physiologically. This compensatory increase of the dopamine
turnover rate is another aspect of functional differences between the caudate
nucleus and putamen. Investigation of the dopamine content in the head, body, and
tail of the caudate nucleus showed no differences in the concentration of
dopamine. However, a study of the metabolic rate of dopamine using
alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine, a tyrosine hydoxylase inhibitor, showed higher
metabolism of dopamine in the head of the caudate nucleus in common marmosets.
Thus, dopaminergic neurons projecting to the caudate nucleus may show
topographical differences in their firing rates. A microdialysis study indicated 
an increase in the metabolism of adenosine in the striatum of MPTP-treated
animals. Cholinergic neurons are interneurons and are one of the main sources of 
adenosine in the striatum. Dopaminergic input from the substantia nigra acting on
cholinergic neurons was decreased following MPTP treatment. The increase of
adenosine metabolism suggested that cholinergic neurons in the striatum receive
inhibitory inputs from nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons.

Non-invasive collection of ejaculates from the common marmoset (Callithrix
jacchus) using penile vibrostimulation.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Reproductive Biology, German Primate Center, Goettingen,
Germany.

Penile vibrostimulation (PVS), a noninvasive repeatable method, has been shown in
the squirrel monkey to yield semen of higher quality than rectal probe
electro-ejaculation (RPE). The present study aimed at establishing the conditions
for PVS to collect ejaculates from marmoset monkeys. Ten adult males were trained
on the appropriate handling before each was subject to six to 12 PVS tests.
Ejaculation was stimulated using a FertiCare personal vibrator fitted with a 2 cm
x 0.5 cm i.d. glass tube. The stimulus was repeatedly applied over a frequency of
75-95 Hz and amplitude of 1-2 mm for up to 20 min. Ejaculates were analyzed for
volume, total sperm number, sperm concentration, and proportion of living and
motile sperm. Ejaculates were obtained in 31 of 88 PVS tests; 87.1% of the
ejaculations occurred at 80-85 Hz frequency and 1-1.5 mm amplitude. In 18 tests
ejaculates were produced within 49.7 seconds. Ejaculates were characterized by
(mean values): volume 31.9 microl, total sperm number 34.2 x 10(6)/ejaculate,
concentration 1,154.2 x 10(6) sperm/ml, live sperm 74.6%, motile sperm 59.6%.
Total number and concentration of spermatozoa were significantly enhanced in
singly living males. PVS yielded three to four times more spermatozoa than
comparable previously published values for RPE. Enhancing the success rate by
preselecting males for responsiveness may render PVS the sperm collection method 
of choice in marmoset monkeys.

Comparative study on the distribution patterns of P2X(1)-P2X(6) receptor
immunoreactivity in the brainstem of the rat and the common marmoset (Callithrix 
jacchus): association with catecholamine cell groups.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pharmacology, Monash University, Clayton, Victoria 3168,
Australia.

The present study investigated the topographical distribution of P2X(1)-P2X(6)
receptor subtypes in the rat and common marmoset hindbrain by
immunohistochemistry. In addition, double-labeling immunofluorescence was used to
determine the extent of colocalization between catecholamine cell groups and the 
various P2X receptors. The data demonstrate a widespread distribution pattern for
all six P2X receptors throughout both the rat hindbrain and the marmoset
hindbrain, although distinctions between species, brain nuclei, and P2X receptor 
subtypes exist. In rat, dense staining for the P2X receptors was found in the
nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), medial vestibular nucleus, and medial and
lateral parabrachial nuclei. Moderate staining was observed in the hypoglossal
nucleus, cuneate nucleus, inferior olive, prepositus hypoglossi, rostral
ventrolateral medulla (RVLM), and locus coeruleus. Staining was also observed in 
the gracile nucleus, the mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus, and the central
pontine gray. In marmoset, prominent P2X receptor-like immunoreactivity occurred 
in the NTS, medial cuneate nucleus, prepositus hypoglossi, and medial vestibular 
nucleus. Moderate staining was observed in the area postrema, dorsal motor
nucleus of the vagus, lateral cuneate, lateral reticular, spinal trigeminal
nucleus, RVLM, and inferior olive. Immunofluorescent double labeling of tyrosine 
hydroxylase (TH)-containing cells revealed that all subtypes of P2X receptors
show some degree of colocalization with TH. The highest proportion of TH and P2X 
receptor double labeling was in the A5 region (with the P2X(2) subunit), whereas 
the lowest proportion of double-labeled cells occurred in the C2 region of the
NTS for the P2X(5) subunit. These findings support a role for extracellular
adenosine 5'-triphosphate in fast synaptic neurotransmission within the
brainstem.

Intraretinal axon diameter: a single cell analysis in the marmoset (Callithrix
jacchus).

Walsh N(1), Fitzgibbon T, Ghosh KK.

Author information: 
(1)Institute for Biomedical Research, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW,
Australia 2006.

We have labelled individual retinal ganglion cells of a New World primate, the
common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) with neurobiotin and then measured axon,
soma and dendritic field diameter. A total of 111 cells were analysed (62 parasol
cells, 22 midget cells, 16 hedge cells and 11 small bistratified cells). When all
retinal ganglion cells were grouped together axon diameter was positively
correlated to soma diameter. When analysed according to cell class only midget
cells showed a positive correlation between soma size and mean axon diameter.
Dendritic field diameter and mean axon diameter of both parasol and midget cells 
showed significant correlations. Axon diameter is not constant along the
intraretinal length of the axon and the rate of change in diameter appears to be 
related to the cell class and the initial size of the axon. Midget cell axons
showed a rapid increase of up to 20% over the first 200 microm in contrast to
parasol cell axons which increased more slowly over this distance but then showed
a marked increase in diameter of up to 40% over the next 450 microm. However,
axon diameter did not remain at these increased diameters but decreased at
greater distances from the soma. The degree to which an axon changes its diameter
is related to retinal ganglion cell class and the initial size of the axon. We
postulate that these variations in intraretinal axon diameter may have a direct
influence on conduction velocity and reflect a compensatory mechanism to minimise
spatiotemporal dispersion along the visual pathway.

The putamen of the human striatum is a heterogeneous nucleus that contains the
primary site of loss of dopamine (DA) in Parkinson's disease (PD). Furthermore,
different functional domains of the putamen are heterogeneously susceptible to DA
loss, and yet the dynamic regulation of extracellular DA concentration ([DA](o)) 
and comparison between domains has not been explored in the primate brain. In
these studies, DA was measured in real time using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry at
a carbon-fiber microelectrode in vitro in striatal sections from the common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). [DA](o) released by a single stimulus pulse varied
threefold along a ventromedial-dorsolateral axis. DA uptake was via the DA
transporter (GBR12909 sensitive, desipramine insensitive). On the basis of data
modeling with simulations of Michaelis-Menten kinetics, rate maximum, V(max),
varied with region: both [DA](o) and V(max) were greatest in regions most
vulnerable in PD. These differences were reflected in part by regional variation 
in DA content. [DA](o), V(max), and regional variation were two- to threefold
greater than in rodent caudatoputamen. In addition, steady-state [DA](o) at
physiological firing rates in primate striatum was controlled by depolarization
frequency, uptake, and presynaptic autoreceptors. Furthermore, regulation of
[DA](o) by these mechanisms differed significantly between limbic- and
motor-associated domains. These data indicate interspecies heterogeneity in
striatal DA dynamics that must be considered when extrapolating behavioral and
drug responses from rodent to the primate brain. Moreover, the heterogeneity
demonstrated within the primate putamen in the availability and dynamic
regulation of DA may be central to understanding DA function in health, cocaine
abuse, and disease.

Here we present the first report of heart rate, blood pressure, and locomotive
activity of a female common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) that was moving freely 
in its home cage during gestation, parturition, and lactation. We collected the
data by using a miniaturized telemetry and data-acquisition system (Data
Sciences, St. Paul, MN) that had been adapted for marmosets (1). The parameters
were recorded continually from 12 days before to 15 days after parturition.
Parturition lasted about 3.5 h, during which marked changes in heart rate,
systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure occurred. To obtain control
values, we again measured these parameters for 13 days during a "physiologically 
neutral" phase (4 months after parturition), when the female was neither pregnant
nor lactating. Heart rate was 200% higher, systolic blood pressure was 25%
higher, and diastolic blood pressure was 75% higher during parturition than
during the neutral phase.

L-DOPA produces strong induction of c-fos messenger RNA in dopamine-denervated
cortical and striatal areas of the common marmoset.

Common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) with near-complete unilateral
6-hydroxydopamine denervation of the dopaminergic input received a single
injection of saline or L-DOPA (15mg/kg plus 6.25mg/kg benserazide). Using in situ
hybridization, the effects of these treatments on c-fos messenger RNA expression 
in the cerebral cortex, the striatal complex and the external layer of the
pallidum were studied. Moreover, receptor autoradiography was used to determine
the levels of dopamine D(1) and D(2) receptors in these areas. In the cerebral
cortex, animals treated with L-DOPA displayed a high expression of c-fos
messenger RNA restricted to the dopamine-denervated hemisphere. No changes in the
levels of cortical D(1) and D(2) receptors were found in the dopamine-denervated 
hemisphere. L-DOPA treatment also induced a strong expression of c-fos messenger 
RNA in the striatal complex in the dopamine-denervated hemisphere. The levels of 
striatal D(2), but not D(1), receptors were increased in the dopamine-denervated 
hemisphere. In the external pallidum, the major terminal region for D(2) dopamine
receptor-containing striatal projection neurons, L-DOPA treatment induced c-fos
messenger RNA expression in both the intact and the dopamine-denervated
hemispheres.Thus, using c-fos messenger RNA as a biochemical marker of
postsynaptic neuronal activation, these results provide evidence that
near-complete dopamine depletion causes a profound supersensitization to L-DOPA
treatment in the cerebral cortex and in the striatal complex, but not in the
external layer of the pallidum, of the primate brain. The cortical response may
be unique to the primate brain, but c-fos messenger RNA activation within the
striatum has also been reported in the rodent. The effects of L-DOPA probably
depend both on a direct activation of supersensitized dopamine receptors by
dopamine produced in the few remaining, but hyperactive, dopaminergic nerve
terminals and in serotonergic nerve terminals, as well as on indirect actions of 
L-DOPA related to activation of circuitries connecting cerebral cortex and basal 
ganglia structures. These results provide novel information on the mechanisms
underlying L-DOPA's action in the cerebral cortex, striatum and external pallidum
in a primate model of Parkinson's disease.

A New World monkey, the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), will be used as a
preclinical animal model to study the feasibility of cell and gene therapy
targeting immunological and hematological disorders. For elucidating the
immunogenetic background of common marmoset to further studies, in the present
study, polymorphisms of MHC-DRB genes in this species were examined. Twenty-one
Caja-DRB exon 2 alleles, including seven new ones, were detected by means of
subcloning and the polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation
polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) methods followed by nucleotide sequencing. Based on the
alignment of these allele sequences, we designed two pairs of specific primers
and established a PCR-SSCP method for DNA-based histocompatibility typing of the 
common marmoset. According to the family segregation data and phylogenetic
analyses, we presumed that Caja-DRB alleles could be classified into five
different loci. Southern blotting analysis also supported the existence of
multiple DRB loci. The patterns of nucleotide substitutions suggests that
positive selection operates in the antigen-recognition sites of Caja-DRB genes.

Edinburgh EH3 9ET, UK.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a small New World primate of high
fecundity, is widely used in reproductive research. The aim of the present study 
was to determine the organization of the germ cells within the seminiferous
epithelium, the duration of the spermatogenic cycle and the number of
spermatogonial mitoses. Antibodies to cAMP response element modulator (CREM) and 
proliferating nuclear cell antigen (PCNA) and a cRNA directed against protamine
P2 and morphological criteria were used to discriminate between stages of the
spermatogenic cycle. Plastic sections were used to document the cell associations
present in each of the nine stages of spermatogenesis. Up to five such stages
could be observed within individual cross-sections of seminiferous tubules. Based
on the pattern of incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine the length of the
spermatogenic cycle was estimated to be 10 days and the duration of
spermatogenesis to be 37 days. Four mitotic divisions were noted in
spermatogonia. It is concluded that the organization of spermatogenesis in the
marmoset has similarities to the human ('helical') and this makes the marmoset a 
suitable model for studies relevant to human testicular function.

Estrogens and androgens are essential for the maturation of the ovarian follicle 
and normal fertility in the female. We have used antibodies specific for both
forms of estrogen receptor (alpha [ERalpha] and beta [ERbeta]) and androgen
receptor (AR) to investigate the pattern of receptor expression in ovaries
obtained from women and from a New World primate, the Common marmoset (Callthrix 
jacchus). On Western blots, three antibodies directed against different peptides 
within human ERbeta all recognized recombinant human (h) ERbeta but did not bind 
to recombinant hERalpha. The ERbeta protein was extracted from human ovary and
prostate and marmoset ovary. In marmoset and human ovaries, ERbeta protein was
detected in the nuclei of granulosa cells in all sizes of follicle (both before
and after formation of the antrum), and it was also detected in thecal cells,
corpora lutea, surface epithelium, and stroma. In contrast, ERalpha protein was
not detected in the nuclei of granulosa cells in preantral follicles, was
low/absent from stromal and thecal cells, but was expressed in granulosa cells of
antral follicles and in the surface epithelium. The pattern of expression of AR
protein more closely resembled that of ERbeta than ERalpha. In conclusion, three 
independent antibodies have demonstrated convincingly that ERbeta is expressed in
a wide range of cells in the primate ovary. Granulosa cells in preantral
follicles could contain ERbeta:beta dimers. In antral follicles, however, ERalpha
is also expressed, and the formation of homo- or heterodimers containing ERalpha 
may influence the pattern of gene activation within these cells.

Cyto- and chemoarchitecture of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons in the common 
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).

Boston, Massachusetts 02215, USA.

The cyto- and chemoarchitecture of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCN) was
investigated in the lower primate, the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). A
large population of magnocellular, hyperchromic, and choline acetyltransferase
(ChAT)-positive neurons was detected in the marmoset basal forebrain. The
distribution of these neurons was similar to those in higher primates. Thus,
ChAT-positive neurons were observed in the medial septum (Ch2), the vertical
(Ch2) and horizontal (Ch3) limbs of the diagonal band of Broca, and the nucleus
basalis of Meynert (Ch4). The Ch4 complex was relatively well differentiated and 
displayed distinct sectors. We detected anterior (Ch4a, with a medial and a
lateral subdivision), intermediate (Ch4i, with a dorsal and a ventral
subdivision), and posterior (Ch4p) sectors in the marmoset Ch4. The Ch4i was
relatively small while the Ch4p was large. Similar to the rodent, the marmoset
Ch1 extended quite a distance posteriorly, and the Ch4p displayed a major
interstitial component distributed within the globus pallidus, its medullary
laminae, and the internal capsule. Virtually all of the marmoset BFCN displayed
acetylcholinesterase activity, and low affinity (p75(NTR)) and high affinity
(Trk) neurotrophin receptor immunoreactivity. A majority contained
immunoreactivity for calbindin-D(28K) and calretinin. Many of the Ch4 neurons
also displayed tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity. The BFCN lacked galanin
immunoreactivity, but were innervated by galanin-positive fibers. None of the
marmoset BFCN were NADPH-d-positive. Thus, the BFCN display major anatomical and 
biochemical differences in the marmoset when compared with higher primates. The
marmoset BFCN also display many characteristics common to other primates. This
fact, combined with the relatively short life span of the marmoset, indicates
that this species may be ideal for studies of age-related changes in the BFCN.

Antiparkinsonian and neuroprotective effects of modafinil in the mptp-treated
common marmoset.

The psychostimulant drug, modafinil, protects rodents against
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) toxicity, striatal ischemia
and partial transection of the nigro-striatal pathway. We now report on the
ability of modafinil to reverse motor disability in MPTP-treated common marmosets
and to prevent MPTP-induced nigral cell death in this species. In the initial
experiments, adult common marmosets were treated with MPTP to produce stable
motor deficits. The subsequent administration of modafinil (10, 30 or 100
mg/kg/day, p.o.) produced a dose-dependent reversal of motor disability. In a
subsequent experiment, normal common marmosets were concurrently treated with 10,
30 or 100 mg/kg of modafinil once daily by gavage during acute MPTP
administration (daily for 5 days), continuing for 2 weeks after the last dose of 
MPTP. Modafinil dose-dependently prevented the decline in motor activity normally
produced by MPTP treatment. MPTP treatment caused a 76% loss of nigral
tyrosine-hydroxylase-immunoreactive cells in placebo-treated animals, and this
was dose-dependently prevented by modafinil. At the highest dose (100 mg/kg/day) 
of modafinil, there was no significant loss of
tyrosine-hydroxylase-immunoreactive cells in the substantia nigra compared with
normal animals. MPTP treatment also reduced striatal dopamine uptake sites by
95%, as measured by specific [3H]-mazindol binding, compared with normal
controls. Modafinil treatment dose-dependently reduced the loss of specific
[3H]-mazindol binding. Behavioural and morphological evidence in the present
study indicate a potential antiparkinsonian and neuroprotective role for
modafinil, which may form a new pharmacological approach to the treatment of
Parkinson's disease.

RATIONALE: Some features of Parkinson's disease are exacerbated by stress and
anxiety and it is important to understand the effects of dopamine receptor
agonists on measures of anxiety. The aim of this study was to assess the effects 
of the dopamine D2/D3 receptor agonist ropinirole in models of anxiety and
depression in the rat, mouse and marmoset.
RESULTS: In the rat elevated plus-maze test, ropinirole (0.01-1 mg/kg, i.p.)
produced an inverted-U dose-response curve in the percentage time spent in the
open arms. Compared with vehicle, ropinirole (0.1 mg/kg) had a significant
anxiolytic-like effect, which was similar to that observed with 1.5 mg/kg
diazepam. This effect was found at doses that did not affect motor behaviour or
induce stereotypy. In the mouse black and white box test of anxiety, ropinirole
(0.1-10 mg/kg, i.p.) increased both the rearing time and number of line crosses
in the white section. This effect reached statistical significance for both
measures at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg and suggests an anxiolytic-like action of the
compound. By contrast, the dopamine agonist bromocriptine (0.1-10 mg/kg, i.p.)
did not produce significant changes in these behaviours. In the marmoset human
threat test, ropinirole (0.01-10 microg/kg, s.c.) reduced the number of postures 
at all doses tested and this reached statistical significance at 10 microg/kg.
Ropinirole did not compromise the effect of amitriptyline in the Porsolt test of 
depression and in itself produced antidepressant-like effects.
CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that systemic administration of ropinirole
produces anxiolytic-like effects in three separate models in the mouse, rat and
marmoset. This may predict an action of ropinirole in man that would provide a
superior profile of action over other presently available anti-parkinsonian
agents.

The collagen repeat sequence is a determinant of the degree of herpesvirus
saimiri STP transforming activity.

Virology, New England Regional Primate Research Center, Harvard Medical School,

Herpesvirus saimiri (HVS) is divided into three subgroups, A, B, and C, based on 
sequence divergence at the left end of genomic DNA in which the saimiri
transforming protein (STP) resides. Subgroup A and C strains transform primary
common marmoset lymphocytes to interleukin-2-independent growth, whereas subgroup
B strains do not. To investigate the nononcogenic phenotype of the subgroup B
viruses, STP genes from seven subgroup B virus isolates were cloned and
sequenced. Consistent with the lack of oncogenic activity of HVS subgroup B
viruses, STP-B was deficient for transforming activity in rodent fibroblast
cells. Sequence comparison reveals that STP-B lacks the signal-transducing
modules found in STP proteins of the other subgroups, collagen repeats and an
authentic SH2 binding motif. Substitution mutations demonstrated that the lack of
collagen repeats but not an SH2 binding motif contributed to the nontransforming 
phenotype of STP-B. Introduction of the collagen repeat sequence induced
oligomerization of STP-B, resulting in activation of NF-kappaB activity and
deregulation of cell growth control. These results demonstrate that the collagen 
repeat sequence is a determinant of the degree of HVS STP transforming activity.

The New World primate Aotus nancymaae has been recommended by the World Health
Organization (WHO) as a model for evaluation of malaria vaccine candidates, given
its susceptibility to experimental infection with the human malaria parasites
Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax. We present here the nucleotide
sequences of the complete cDNA of MHC-DQA1 and of the polymorphic exon 2 segments
of MHC-DQB1/DQB2. In a group of three nonrelated animals captured in the wild,
five alleles of MHC-DQA1 could be identified. They all belong to one lineage,
namely Aona-DQA1*27. This lineage has not been described in any other New World
monkey species studied. In a group of 19 unrelated animals, 14 Aona-DQB1 alleles 
could be identified which are grouped into the two lineages Aona-DQB1*22 and
Aona-DQB1*23. These lineages have been described previously in the common
marmoset and cotton-top tamarin. In addition, two Aona-DQB2 sequences could be
identified which are highly similar to HLA-DQB2 sequences. Essential amino acid
residues contributing to MHC DQ peptide binding pockets number 1 and 4 are
conserved or semi-conserved between HLA-DQ and Aona-DQ molecules, indicating a
capacity to bind similar peptide repertoires. These results fully support the use
of Aotus monkeys as an animal model for evaluation of future subunit vaccine
candidates.

Distribution of the alpha1 subunit of the GABA(A) receptor on midget and parasol 
ganglion cells in the retina of the common marmoset Callithrix jacchus.

of Sydney, NSW, Australia.

The inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) has been shown to 
influence the responses of ganglion cells in the mammalian retina. Consistently, 
GABA(A) receptor subunits have been localized to different ganglion cell types.
In this study, the distribution of the alpha1 subunit of the GABA(A) receptor on 
the dendrites of midget and parasol ganglion cells was investigated
quantitatively in the retina of a New World monkey, the marmoset. Ganglion cells 
were injected with Neurobiotin in a live in vitro retinal whole-mount
preparation. Retinal pieces were then processed with an antibody against the
alpha1 subunit of the GABA(A) receptor. Strong punctate immunoreactivity
indicative of synaptic localization is present in the ON and OFF sublamina of the
inner plexiform layer. Many of the immunoreactive puncta coincide with the
dendrites of both midget and parasol ganglion cells. Immunoreactive puncta are
present on distal and proximal dendrites of ON and OFF cells of both ganglion
cell types. On average, parasol cells show a slight increase in the spatial
density of immunoreactive puncta with distance from the soma, whereas the density
of immunoreactive puncta on midget cells stays even. Parasol ganglion cells show 
a slightly higher average density of immunoreactive puncta (0.083 puncta/microm
dendrite) than midget cells (0.054 puncta/microm dendrite).

Herpesvirus saimiri (HVS) is the prototype gamma-2 herpesvirus; it has
significant homology to the human gammaherpesviruses Kaposi's sarcoma-associated 
virus and Epstein-Barr virus and the murine gammaherpesvirus murine herpesvirus
68. HVS causes a persistent asymptomatic infection in its natural host, the
squirrel monkey. Both subgroups A and C possess the ability to immortalize common
marmoset T lymphocytes to interleukin-2-independent proliferation. However, only 
subgroup C is capable of transforming human, rabbit, and rhesus monkey
lymphocytes in vitro. In addition, HVS can stably transduce a variety of human
cell lines where the virus persists as a nonintegrating circular episome. In this
study, we have developed a system in which the HVS DNA is stably maintained as a 
nonintegrated circular episome in the human lung carcinoma cell line A549. Virus 
production can be reactivated using chemical inducing agents, including
tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate and n-butyrate, suggesting that the infection in
human A549 cells is latent. To analyze virus gene expression in these stably
transduced cells, Northern blot analysis was performed using a series of probes
produced from restriction fragments spanning the entire coding region of the HVS 
genome. This demonstrated that an adjacent set of genes containing open reading
frames (ORFs) 71 to 73 are expressed in this stably transduced cell line.
Moreover, these genes are transcribed as a polycistronic mRNA species produced
from a common promoter upstream of ORF 73. This model may serve as a useful tool 
in the further analysis of the role of ORFs 71 to 73 in gamma-2 herpesvirus
latency.

Transdermal administration of piribedil reverses MPTP-induced motor deficits in
the common marmoset.

The ability of transdermal administration of the dopamine D2/D3 agonist piribedil
(1-[3,4-methylenedioxybenzyl)]-4-[(2-pyrimidinyl)]piperazine) to reverse
hypokinesia and other motor deficits observed in MPTP-treated common marmosets
was investigated. Piribedil (2.5-10.0 mg/animal), applied directly to the skin of
the abdomen as a paste, produced a long-lasting and concentration-dependent
reversal of motor deficits. The antiparkinsonian actions of piribedil occurred
within 10 minutes of drug administration and lasted as long as 10 hours.
Transdermally applied piribedil produced a pattern of locomotor activity
characteristic of normal motor behavior in this species. Symptoms of nausea
(marked excessive salivation, retching, and/or vomiting) were not observed after 
transdermal application of piribedil. Additionally, pretreatment with the
peripheral dopamine antagonist domperidone enhanced the antiparkinsonian effects 
of piribedil. Application to the skin of monolayer or bilayer patches impregnated
with piribedil also produced a marked increase in locomotor activity and reversal
of motor deficits. After application of various patch fractions (whole, one-half,
or one-fourth), the increase in locomotor activity and reversal of disability
correlated well with the surface area of skin covered. Measurement of serum
levels of piribedil after single application of bilayer patches showed a positive
relationship between drug levels and antiparkinsonian activity. Repeated daily
application of piribedil bilayer patches for 5 days to MPTP-treated common
marmosets primed to show dyskinesia by previous exposure to L-Dopa produced
antiparkinsonian activity accompanied by dyskinetic movements. Transdermal
administration of dopamine agonists such as piribedil may provide a useful means 
of producing a long-lasting reversal of motor deficits in Parkinson's disease
while avoiding acute adverse effects such as nausea.

Humans and the cotton top tamarin, a model for colitis and colorectal cancer,
share carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) moieties. We quantified CEA in colonic
washings and extracts in both, and CEA bands were confirmed by Western blot. We
compared CEA-family expression in tissues and serum in the tamarin with that of
the common marmoset, which develops colitis but not cancer. CEA levels are higher
in tamarin washings compared with humans, and higher than in marmosets extracts
(P<0.005). CEA molecular species appear to be specific, and human CEA-family
member epitopes are also found in these primates. The higher CEA levels in the
tamarin may reflect the overall higher cancer prevalence.

Huntington's disease is a genetically inherited neurodegenerative disorder for
which currently there is no effective treatment or cure. In order to gauge the
potential therapeutic benefits of neuroprotective or restorative treatments, it
is necessary to create an animal model that is associated with readily measurable
and long-lasting functional impairments. The undifferentiated neostriatum and
limited behavioural repertoire of rodents have led to the extension of our
investigations into the common marmoset. We have used quinolinic acid to create
unilateral excitotoxic lesions of the caudate nucleus or the putamen in this
small non-human primate. Following rigorous investigation of each monkey on a
battery of behavioural tests, we found that the unilateral putamen lesion was
associated with a contralateral motor impairment that persisted for at least 9
months and withstood repeated testing. However, the unilateral caudate nucleus
lesion did not appear to be associated with any detectable motor deficit. The
stability and the reproducibility of the unilateral putamen lesion in the
marmoset provide a suitable tool for the investigation of potential treatments
for neurodegenerative disorders that attack this region of the brain.

Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in outbred marmoset monkeys
(Callithrix jacchus) is a recently developed nonhuman primate model of multiple
sclerosis. Here, Bert 't Hart and colleagues compare this model to EAE in rhesus 
monkeys, highlighting autoimmune mechanisms in CNS inflammation and
demyelination, including the role of major histocompatibility complex restriction
and preclinical evaluation of innovative immunotherapies.

Socially subordinate female common marmoset monkeys undergo pronounced, chronic
reductions in basal plasma cortisol levels, which appear to result both from
socially induced suppression of reproductive hormones and from direct effects of 
social subordination. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that this cortisol 
suppression is mediated by reduced adrenocortical responsiveness to
adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). Dominant, subordinate, and ovariectomized
females were given dexamethasone (5 mg/kg, IM), followed the next morning by
human ACTH(1-39) (10 microg/kg, IV) or sterile saline (0.5 ml/kg, IV); blood
samples were collected at -20 through 150 min from ACTH or saline treatment and
assayed for cortisol. ACTH, but not saline, caused a marked elevation of plasma
cortisol levels. Prior to ACTH treatment, dominant females tended to have higher 
dexamethasone-suppressed cortisol levels than subordinate and ovariectomized
females. After ACTH treatment, dominant females had significantly higher cortisol
concentrations, as well as higher peak and net integrated cortisol responses to
ACTH, than did subordinate and ovariectomized animals; the latter two groups
showed comparable cortisol responses to ACTH. These results suggest that dampened
adrenocortical responsiveness to ACTH contributes to chronic reductions in
cortisol levels in subordinate female marmosets and may be mediated by
suppression of reproductive hormones.

Multiple sclerosis is a demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system
(CNS), in which an immune attack directed against myelin constituents causes
myelin destruction and death of oligodendrocytes, the myelin-producing cells.
Here, the efficacy of nerve growth factor (NGF), a growth factor for neurons and 
oligodendrocytes, in promoting myelin repair was evaluated using the
demyelinating model of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) in the
common marmoset. Surprisingly, we found that NGF delayed the onset of clinical
EAE and, pathologically, prevented the full development of EAE lesions. We
demonstrate by immunocytochemistry that NGF exerts its antiinflammatory effect by
downregulating the production of interferon gamma by T cells infiltrating the
CNS, and upregulating the production of interleukin 10 by glial cells in both
inflammatory lesions of EAE and normal-appearing CNS white matter. Thus, NGF,
currently under investigation in human clinical trials as a neuronal trophic
factor, may be an attractive candidate for therapy of autoimmune demyelinating
disorders.

Pepsinogens A and C, and prochymosin were purified from four species of adult New
World monkeys, namely, common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), cotton-top tamarin
(Saguinus oedipus), squirrel monkey (Saimiri sciureus), and capuchin monkey
(Cebus apella). The occurrence of prochymosin was quite unique since this zymogen
is known to be neonate-specific and, in primates, it has been thought that the
prochymosin gene is not functional. No multiple form has been detected for any
type of pepsinogen except that two pepsinogen-A isozymogens were identified in
capuchin monkey. Pepsins A and C, and chymosin hydrolyzed hemoglobin optimally at
pH 2-2.5 with maximal activities of about 20, 30, and 15 units/mg protein.
Pepsins A were inhibited in the presence of an equimolar amount of pepstatin, and
chymosins and pepsins C needed 5- and 100-fold molar excesses of pepstatin for
complete inhibition, respectively. Hydrolysis of insulin B chain occurred first
at the Leu15-Tyr16 bond in the case of pepsins A and chymosins, and at either the
Leu15-Tyr16 or Tyr16-Leu17 bond in the case of pepsins C. The presence of
different types of pepsins might be advantageous to New World monkeys for the
efficient digestion of a variety of foods. Molecular cloning of cDNAs for three
types of pepsinogens from common marmoset was achieved. A phylogenetic tree of
pepsinogens based on the nucleotide sequence showed that common marmoset diverged
from the ancestral primate about 40 million years ago.

The lung of the marmoset (Callithrix jacchus): ultrastructure and morphometric
data.

Barbier A(1), Bachofen H.

Berne, Switzerland.

Owing to its small size (body weight 300-400 g), its modest demands on animal
husbandry, and in particular its relatively long life-span (up to 12 years) the
common marmoset (cotton ear marmoset: Callithrix jacchus (Cj)) might be a useful 
animal model to study the adaptive capacity to different energetic demands,
adverse environmental influences such as air pollution, and aging of the lung. In
order to describe the gas exchange apparatus of healthy marmosets as a basis for 
further pulmonary research, the lungs of three young adult animals have been
analysed both qualitatively and quantitatively (by morphometry) at the light and 
electronmicroscopic level. Qualitatively, there is a general similarity in the
architecture and structure of lung parenchyma between marmosets and other
mammals. Quantitatively, the alveolar surface area was found to be 7662+/-1647
cm(2). Capillary surface area and volume were 6000+/-1549 cm(2), and 1.01+/-0.34 
ml, respectively. The harmonic mean thickness of the air-blood barrier was
0.517+/-0.117 microm. These morphometric parameters allowed to estimate the
diffusing capacity for oxygen at 0.0299+/-0.0134 ml O(2) (sec mmHg)(-1). In
comparison with mammals of similar body size (rats, quinea pigs) it appears that 
the marmoset has a higher gas exchanging capacity of the lung, which might
reflect the 'athletic' activity of this small primate. An incidental finding
worth mentioning is the individual variability of septal structures due to
variations in capillary blood volume and hematocrit. The distinction between such
functional variations and subtle pathologic alterations of lung tissue requires a
morphometric analysis at the electron-microscopic level.

Localization and signaling of the prolactin receptor in the uterus of the common 
marmoset monkey.

Dalrymple A(1), Jabbour HN.

Author information: 
(1)Medical Research Council Reproductive Biology Unit, Center for Reproductive
Biology, Edinburgh, United Kingdom.

This study investigated the expression and signaling pathway of PRL and its
receptor in the non-pregnant uterus of the common marmoset monkey.
Immunohistochemistry localized PRL expression to the stromal compartment of the
endometrium. Expression was minimal during the proliferative phase and was
up-regulated during the mid to late secretory phase of the ovulatory cycle. In
situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry localized expression of the PRL
receptor to the glandular epithelium of the endometrium. Similar to that of PRL, 
PRL receptor expression was minimal during the proliferative phase and was
dramatically up-regulated during the secretory phase. The temporal pattern of PRL
receptor gene expression in the marmoset uterus across the cycle was further
confirmed by ribonuclease protection assay. The roles of Janus kinase-2 (JAK2)
and signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 (STAT1) in the
intracellular signaling pathway of PRL were also assessed in the mid to late
secretory phase. JAK2/STAT1 proteins were localized in the glandular epithelial
compartment, and both proteins were temporally phosphorylated in response to PRL.
Finally, the pattern of expression of the interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) 
gene and the effect of PRL on transcription of IRF-1 were investigated during the
mid to late secretory phase. IRF-1 expression in the marmoset uterus was encoded 
by a protein of 48 kDa and was localized to the glandular epithelial compartment,
as was observed for the PRL receptor and JAK2/STAT1 proteins. Moreover,
incubation of mid to late secretory uterine tissue with PRL for 1 and 3 h
resulted in 0.4 +/- 0.2- and 2.4 +/-0.5-fold (P < 0.05) inductions of the IRF-1
gene, respectively. These studies confirm the expression of both PRL and its
receptor in the uterus of the marmoset monkey. Expression of both genes is
up-regulated during the mid to late secretory phase of the ovulatory cycle. PRL
function in the marmoset uterus is linked to the JAK/STAT signaling pathway,
leading to the regulation of expression of PRL-responsive genes such as IRF-1.
The site of expression of PRL, PRL receptors, and IRF-1 in the marmoset uterus
suggest that PRL may influence glandular epithelial function and direct gene
transcription in these cells in a paracrine fashion.

Comparative aspects of the metabolism and excretion of cortisol in three
individual nonhuman primates.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Reproductive Biology, Germany Primate Center, Göttingen,
Germany.

A radiometabolism study is described to provide the first comparative data on the
time course, route, and characteristics of excreted [3H]cortisol metabolites in
three nonhuman primates: the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), the
long-tailed macaque (Macacafascicularis), and the chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes). A
low dose (40-100 microCi) of 3H-labeled cortisol was administered intravenously
to one adult male of each species and the excreta collected over a 5-day period
postinjection. The major proportion of radioactivity was excreted in the urine
(>80%). Peak radioactivity in urine was recovered within 5.5 h following
injection in all three species, while in the feces peak levels of radioactivity
were recovered within 26 h postinjection. In all three species, urinary
metabolites were primarily excreted as conjugates (61-87%), whereas the
percentage of conjugated metabolites in feces was 50% or less. The number and
relative abundance of urinary and fecal [3H]cortisol metabolites were determined 
by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and
immunoreactivity of the radioactivity peaks was assessed by screening HPLC
fractions with established cortisol, corticosterone, and 11-oxoetiocholanolone
enzyme immunoassays (EIA), the latter being a group-specific assay for measuring 
11,17-dioxoandrostanes. HPLC separation of urinary and fecal extracts revealed
multiple peaks of radioactivity, several of which were common to all three
species. The relative proportion of these peaks, however, differed considerably
among species and between urine and feces. HPLC indicated that native cortisol
was a major urinary excretory product in the marmoset, while comparatively small 
amounts were present in the urine of the macaque and chimpanzee. In contrast, in 
feces, cortisol was only detected in low amounts in the marmoset and was
virtually absent in the macaque and chimpanzee. In all three species, one of the 
major radioactivity peaks showed a retention time comparable to
11-oxoetiocholanolone and high immunoreactivity in the 11-oxoetiocholanolone EIA.
The measurement of urinary- and/or fecal-immunoreactive 11,17-dioxoandrostanes is
therefore implicated for noninvasive assessment of adrenal function in Old World 
monkeys, New World monkeys, and great apes.

A safe means of anaesthetizing common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) for a study 
using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to investigate cerebral ischaemia was
required. Continuous infusion of alphaxalone/alphadalone was used to anaesthetize
37 marmosets for non-recovery and recovery experiments. This was found to give
safe, reliable anaesthesia when coupled with pulse oximetry and
electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring.

Motor neurons are rich in non-phosphorylated neurofilaments: cross-species
comparison and alterations in ALS.

Center, Boston, MA 02215, USA.

The localization and distribution of non-phosphorylated neurofilaments (NP-NF) in
the upper and lower motor neurons was investigated in the rat, the common
marmoset, the rhesus monkey and man using the SMI-32 antibody. Within the spinal 
cord of all species studied, the most intense NP-NF immunoreactivity was observed
within the ventral horn alpha-motor neurons. Concurrent staining for the
cholinergic marker choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) demonstrated that virtually
all of the ChAT-positive alpha-motor neurons contain NP-NF immunoreactivity.
Although NP-NF staining was also observed in other neurons within the ventral and
intermediate horns, these neurons were loosely scattered and contained a
considerably lower staining intensity. The only other prominent NP-NF staining in
the spinal cord occurred within the neurons of the dorsal nucleus of Clark and
the intermediolateral cell column. Phosphorylated neurofilament (P-NF)
immunoreactivity was found primarily in neuronal processes. Occasionally, a
solitary motor neuron contained weak P-NF immunoreactivity. Within the brainstem,
neurons in all cranial nerve motor nuclei contained intense NP-NF
immunoreactivity. The distribution and apparent density of NP-NF immunoreactive
neurons in these nuclei was virtually identical to that observed for neurons
immunoreactive for ChAT. NP-NF immunoreactive neurons of relatively lower
intensity were found in many other regions of the brainstem. All of the giant
Betz cells of layer (L) V in the motor cortex contained dark NP-NF
immunoreactivity. Within the spinal cord of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)
patients, both Nissl and NP-NF staining demonstrated the dramatic loss of
alpha-motor neurons characteristic of this disorder. Some of the remaining motor 
neurons contained intense P-NF immunoreactivity. These observations suggest that 
NP-NF immunoreactivity is a good marker for motor neurons in health and disease
and may be a useful tool for studies of motor neuron degeneration (MND).

Inhibitory control and affective processing in the prefrontal cortex:
neuropsychological studies in the common marmoset.

The orbitofrontal cortex has been ascribed a role in the inhibitory control, as
well as in the emotional control, of behaviour. While damage to the orbitofrontal
cortex in humans and non-human primates can cause inflexibility, impulsiveness
and emotional disturbance, the relationship between these effects are unclear.
Excitotoxic lesion studies in marmosets comparing the effects of cell loss within
specific regions of the prefrontal cortex on performance of a range of
behavioural tests reveal that mechanisms of response inhibition are not unique to
the orbitofrontal cortex. Instead they are present in distinct cognitive domains 
for lowerorder as well as higher-order processing throughout the prefrontal
cortex. Thus, the lateral prefrontal cortex is involved in the selection and
control of action based upon higher-order rules while the orbitofrontal and
medial prefrontal cortex may be involved in different but complementary forms of 
lower-order rule learning, their roles dissociable, as a result of their
differential contribution to different types of associative learning.

In the present study, changes in the immunohistochemical localization of
leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) in the endometrium during various phases of
ovarian cyclicity of the common marmoset have been reported. LIF was absent
during the early and late follicular phases. LIF was observed mainly in the
cytoplasm of the endometrial glands during the early luteal phase, reached
maximum intensity during the mid-luteal phase and declined again during late
luteal phase. In-situ hybridization also showed a similar cyclic pattern in the
expression of LIF. Stromal cells only showed signals for LIF during the
mid-luteal phase. In ovariectomized marmosets, graded dosages of oestradiol alone
failed to induce the appearance of LIF protein. Progesterone treatment following 
oestradiol priming, however, induced distinct glandular localization of LIF,
indicating that LIF is a progesterone-dependent protein. Thus endometrial LIF is 
under maternal control and is secreted in response to the increased progesterone 
concentrations in circulation. It is possible that high concentrations of LIF
during mid-luteal phase may prepare the endometrium for blastocyst implantation
in marmosets.

The 5-HT1A antagonist, WAY 100 635, alleviates cognitive impairments induced by
dizocilpine (MK-801) in monkeys.

Harder JA(1), Ridley RM.

Central glutamate neurotransmission is modulated by an upregulatory cholinergic
influence and an inhibitory serotonergic influence. In Alzheimer's disease,
cognitive decline is associated with loss of both glutamatergic and cholinergic
neurones (Francis et al., 1992, Progress in Neurobiology 39, 517-545). While
therapeutic strategies for alleviating this cognitive decline have concentrated
on restoring cholinergic tone, we suggest that 5-HT1A antagonists also have the
potential to alleviate the cognitive symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. Previous
studies have shown that dizocilpine (MK-801), a glutamatergic antagonist acting
at the NMDA receptor, produces learning impairments in the common marmoset, a
non-human primate. Specifically, it impairs the acquisition of shape
discrimination and visuospatial conditional tasks, at doses that do not affect
locomotor behaviour or coordination (Harder et al., 1998, Society for
Neuroscience Abstracts 23(1), 219). In the present study we investigated the
effects of WAY 100 635, a 5-HT1A antagonist, on the cognitive deficits induced by
dizocilpine. The number of trials required to learn each type of task under
combined treatment with dizocilpine and WAY 100 635 was significantly lower than 
under dizocilpine treatment alone, and did not differ significantly from the
number of trials required under saline, demonstrating that the cognitive effects 
of glutamatergic blockade can be overcome by treatment with a 5-HT1A antagonist.

The effect of dopamine depletion from the caudate nucleus of the common marmoset 
(Callithrix jacchus) on tests of prefrontal cognitive function.

Collins P(1), Wilkinson LS, Everitt BJ, Robbins TW, Roberts AC.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Experimental Psychology, University of Cambridge, United
Kingdom.

This study examined the effects of depletion of dopamine from the caudate nucleus
of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), on tasks sensitive to prefrontal
damage (attentional set-shifting and spatial delayed response). There was a
marked impairment in performance on the spatial delayed response task, but
performance on the attentional set-shifting task was relatively preserved except 
for an impairment in re-engagement of a previously relevant perceptual dimension.
This pattern of impairment is distinct from that seen after excitotoxic lesions
of the prefrontal cortex and in patients with Parkinson's disease. Though it is
not possible to identify specific cognitive functions that are independent of
dopaminergic modulation of the caudate nucleus, due to the partial nature of the 
lesion, the results do provide insight into those cognitive processes that appear
most dependent on caudate dopamine.

Expression of the integrin subunits alpha 5, alpha 6 and beta 1 in the testes of 
the common marmoset.

Husen B(1), Giebel J, Rune G.

Author information: 
(1)University of Greifswald, Germany.

Integrin subunits alpha 5, alpha 6 and beta 1 were localized in the testis of
pre-pubertal or adult non-human primates (Callithrix jacchus) by
immunofluorescence staining and in situ hybridization. In animals of all ages
subunits alpha 5 and beta 1 were localized in cells of the lamina propria of the 
seminiferous epithelium. In prepubertal animals, the integrin subunits alpha 5,
alpha 6, as well as beta 1, were distributed all over the plasma membrane of
Sertoli cells. In adult animals the integrin subunits were confined to those
plasma membrane regions of Sertoli cells which are assigned to the basal
compartment, including the basement membrane of the seminiferous tubules. Protein
expression of integrin subunits alpha 6 and beta 1 was most pronounced in tubular
stages in which elongated spermatids were not yet present in the adluminal
compartment of the epithelium, suggesting that these integrin subunits are
particularly essential at certain developmental stages of spermatogenesis.
Non-radioactive in situ hybridization revealed that the mRNA for integrin
subunits alpha 5, alpha 6 and beta 1 was expressed by Sertoli cells. In situ
hybridization, together with immunofluorescence data, shows that these integrin
subunits were exclusively synthesized in Sertoli cells. As to functional aspects,
it is concluded that during primate spermatogenesis. Sertoli cell integrins may
be involved in both cell matrix as well as cell-cell interactions, particularly
during early spermatogenesis.

Marmosets normally produce dizygotic twins sharing placental blood vessels and
exchanging bone marrow cells. Each individual is therefore likely to be a blood
chimaera. To date, marmosets had only been DNA fingerprinted using blood samples 
and probes 33.6 and 33.15, resulting in highly similar fingerprints among litter 
mates and little variation between other individuals, thereby limiting this
method's use for individual identification and parentage testing. In this study, 
novel probes were applied to detect greater polymorphism and to produce
individual-specific DNA fingerprints. As expected, blood DNA profiles of twins
and triplets were virtually identical, confirming chimaerism in this tissue and
identifying litter mates. Furthermore, these profiles were sufficiently variable 
to distinguish between sibs from different litters and between all other
individuals. To produce individual-specific DNA fingerprints, the use of DNA
extracted from tissues poor in leukocytes was essential. The findings demonstrate
that, despite extensive blood chimaerism, marmoset colonies can be effectively
DNA fingerprinted for indicidual identification, zygosity testing, and
relationship studies.

Retinohypothalamic projections in the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus): A
study using cholera toxin subunit B.

Retinal projections in vertebrates reach the primary visual, accessory optic, and
circadian timing structures. The central feature of the circadian timing system
is the principal circadian pacemaker, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the
hypothalamus. The direct projections from the retina to the SCN are considered
the entrainment pathway of the circadian timing system. In this study, unilateral
intravitreal injections of cholera toxin subunit B were used to trace the retinal
projections to the marmoset hypothalamus. The retinohypothalamic tract reaches
the ventral suprachiasmatic nucleus bilaterally, as anticipated from previous
studies. However, labeled fibers were found in several other hypothalamic
regions, such as the medial and lateral preoptic areas, supraoptic nucleus,
anterior and lateral hypothalamic areas, retrochiasmatic area, and
subparaventricular zone. These results reveal new aspects of retinohypothalamic
projection in primates and are discussed in terms of their implications for
circadian as well as noncircadian control systems.

In vivo models for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated B cell lymphoproliferative
disease (BLPD).

EBV infects B lymphocytes in vivo and establishes a life-long persistent
infection in the host. The latent infection is controlled by EBV-specific MHC
class 1-restricted CTL. Immunosuppression reduces CTL activity, and this
facilitates outgrowth of EBV+ve B cell lymphoproliferative disease (BLPD). BLPD
are aggressive lesions with high mortality. This review presents some key facets 
in the development of EBV-associated BLPD and in vivo studies on its
pathogenesis. The animal models used to date include the common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus), the cottontop tamarin (Saguinus oedipus oedipus), rhesus
monkey, murine herpesvirus 68 (MHV68), and the severe combined immunodeficient
(scid) mouse, each of which has been used to address particular aspects of EBV
biology and BLPD development. Scid mice inoculated i.p. with PBMC from
EBV-seropositive individuals develop EBV+ve BLPD-like tumours. Thus this small
animal model (hu-PBMC-scid) is currently used by many laboratories to investigate
EBV-associated diseases. We and others have studied BLPD pathogenesis in the
hu-PBMC-scid model and shown that EBV+ve B cells on their own do not give rise to
tumours in this model without inclusion of autologous T cell subsets in the
inoculum. Based on the findings that (1) established tumours do not contain T
cells and (2) tumour cells express a variety of B cell growth factors, a stepwise
model of lymphomagenesis in the scid mouse model can be defined. Additionally,
the hu-PBMC-scid model can be used to assess novel therapeutic regimes against
BLPD before introduction into a clinical setting.

Cutaneous receptive field organization in the ventral posterior nucleus of the
thalamus in the common marmoset.

The organization of cutaneous receptive fields in the ventroposterior (VP)
thalamus of the common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) was determined from
single-unit recordings, and these data were correlated with the cytochrome
oxidase (CO) histochemistry of the thalamus in the same animals. Under
continuously maintained ketamine anesthesia, the receptive fields of a total of
192 single units were recorded from the right VP thalamus using 2 MOhms glass
electrodes. After the receptive fields were mapped, the brains were reacted for
CO histochemistry on 50-microm coronal frozen sections through the entire VP
thalamus. The majority of units were localized to the CO-reactive regions that
define the medial and lateral divisions of VP (VPm and VPl). Apart from the
expected finding of the face being represented in VPm and the body in VPl,
reconstructing the electrode tracks and unit locations in the histological
sections revealed a general association between discrete regions of CO reactivity
and the representation of specific body regions. Some low-threshold cutaneous
units were apparently localized to VPi (the CO weak regions dorsal, ventral, and 
interdigitating with, the CO regions of VP). These VPi units were clearly part of
the same representational map as the VPl and VPm units. We conclude that the
low-threshold cutaneous receptive fields of the marmoset are organized in a
single continuous representation of the contralateral body surface, and that this
representation can most simply be interpreted as being folded or crumpled into
the three-dimensional space of VP thalamus. The folded nature of the body map in 
VP may be related to the folded nature of VP as revealed by CO histochemistry.

New world, but not Old World, monkeys carry several genes encoding
beta-microseminoprotein.

It was shown by Southern hybridization that cotton-top tamarin and common
marmoset, New World monkeys, carry three or more genes encoding
beta-microseminoprotein, also known as PSP94. In contrast, the genomes of Old
World monkeys, as represented by rhesus macaque and sacred baboon, contain a
single gene. Clones containing three different genes encoding
beta-microseminoprotein were isolated from a cotton-top tamarin genomic library. 
They carry two complete genes of four exons and a third gene lacking the first
exon. The structure suggests that the three genes are functionally active and
give rise to transcripts that are approximately 86% similar in sequence. By
sequencing one gene in full, it was shown that the introns carry an excess of
interspersed repeats, on average 29% of the introns consist of Alu repeats. A
phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the genes probably arose in New World
monkeys after the separation from Old World primates.

    J Psychopharmacol. 2000 Mar;14(1):87-8.

Previous studies have suggested that administration of a clinically sign-free
dose of sarin to non-human primates gives rise to subtle changes in brain
electrical activity as measured by electroencephalography (EEG) several months
following exposure. The functional significances of such changes are unclear. The
present study monitored EEG by using implantable radiotelemetry, and also
assessed the performance of complex behavioural tasks, in non-human primates for 
up to 15 months following exposure to a low dose of sarin. Baselines of EEG and
behaviour were shown to be stable over several months in control animals. The
doses of sarin administered caused erythrocyte cholinesterase inhibitions of
36.4% to 67.1%. Overall, no significant changes in EEG patterns were observed
although there were increases in beta 2 amplitude which approached significance
(p=0.07). No deleterious effects on performance were seen on the touchscreen
mediated discrimination tasks presented from the Cambridge Neuropsychological
Test Automated Battery (CANTAB). This study illustrates the validity of the
approach employed and makes an important contribution to the investigation of the
long-term effects of organophosphorous compounds.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in the
marmoset was monitored by serial MR imaging to determine correlates to the
natural-history MR studies in multiple sclerosis (MS). The relationships of
MR-revealed lesions to clinical status and histopathologic findings were also
explored.
METHODS: We induced EAE by subcutaneous inoculation in two marmosets by human
white matter (HWM) and in seven marmosets by MP4 (a chimeric recombinant fusion
protein of myelin-basic and proteolipid protein) in adjuvant along with
intravenous inactivated pertussis vaccine to facilitate the disease process. The 
HWM-inoculated animals were induced with Freund's adjuvant as the established
model of marmoset EAE. The MP4-inoculated animals were induced with either
Freund's incomplete adjuvant or TiterMax as part of a preclinical treatment
trial. MR imaging was performed at 1.5 T at baseline, and repeated at 1- to
2-week intervals for a period of up to 16 weeks in six EAE-induced marmosets, and
intermittently for up to 70 weeks in three EAE-induced and two control marmosets.
Proton density- (PD-) and T2-weighted, pre- and postgadopentetate dimeglumine
enhancement, T1-weighted, and magnetization transfer (MT) images were obtained.
The brains were prepared for histologic evaluation of lesion distribution and
counts, characterization of lesions as demyelinating or inflammatory, and
histopathologic scoring. The clinical, MR, and pathologic scoring were done on
grading systems, and correlated for evaluation.
RESULTS: White matter (WM) changes after EAE induction were observed first at 9
days in the HWM-induced animals and at 2.5 weeks in the MP4-induced animals, with
subsequent week-to-week fluctuations on PD- and T2-weighted images.
Contrast-enhancing lesions were not observed in all animals. MR-revealed WM
lesions correlated to histopathologic analysis of EAE lesions, measuring from 0.5
mm to 1.5 mm. The lesion count and extent of demyelination was greater in the
HWM-induced animals than in the MP4-induced animals. Some MR-revealed lesions
correlated directly to clinical symptoms, but the majority of lesions were
clinically silent.
CONCLUSION: On MR images, lesions in the EAE marmoset model were confined to the 
WM, and their development, resolution, distribution, and enhancing
characteristics fluctuated over the duration of the study. The dynamic
presentation of MR-revealed lesions confirms the parallels between EAE in the
marmoset and relapsing-remitting MS. Clinical symptoms alone were not
representative of ongoing pathologic brain lesions. Therefore, serial MR imaging 
serves as a very important adjunct to clinical and histologic surveillance of the
development of new and the persistence of existing brain lesions in this animal
model of MS.

Unrearable litters and prenatal reduction of litter size in the common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus).

Windle CP(1), Baker HF, Ridley RM, Oerke AK, Martin RD.

Author information:

Cambridge, UK.

It is widely believed that common marmosets (Callithrx jacchus) typically give
birth to twins under natural conditions. In captivity, however, births of
triplets or even larger litters are common, although parents rarely succeed in
rearing more than two offspring. The traditional interpretation is that captive
conditions, notably the ready availability of food, have led to increased
reproductive output, perhaps involving a higher ovulation rate. The present paper
provides evidence, combined from ultrasound examinations between ovulation and
birth and hysterotomies conducted during the late embryonic and early fetal
phase, that the litter size can be progressively reduced during pregnancy without
spontaneous abortion. There is an unusually long lag phase prior to the onset of 
embryonic growth in common marmosets; the fetal stage does not begin until day 80
of the 144-day pregnancy. Reduction in litter size occurs during embryonic stages
(up to day 80), and continues into the fetal stages. These results indicate that 
the common marmoset is adapted for flexible modification of litter size between
ovulation and birth. The high incidence of triplet births in captive colonies may
therefore be an expression of an adapted natural developmental process under
artificial circumstances.

Relaxin in the marmoset monkey: secretion pattern in the ovarian cycle and early 
pregnancy.

Relaxin is a peptide hormone with a broad range of biological activities, related
not only to parturition and lactation but possibly also to decidualization,
implantation, and early pregnancy. The present study was designed to investigate 
the secretion pattern of relaxin throughout the cycle and early pregnancy in the 
common marmoset monkey in relation to ovarian function and the systemic hormone
milieu. First, a novel relaxin ELISA was developed and validated to confirm the
pattern of relaxin secretion during pregnancy. Secondly, serum relaxin profiles
were determined through nonconceptive and conceptive cycles and analyzed in
relation to the concentration of other hormones and to the development of ovarian
follicles and corpora lutea (CL). Blood samples were collected 2-3 times per week
from the experimental animals and analyzed for relaxin, progesterone, and LH. The
animals from the conceptive cycles were also ultrascanned at these time points to
determine the ovarian status up to Day 25 of pregnancy. During early pregnancy,
the relaxin levels in serum were approximately 1 ng/ml, increasing up to 15 ng/ml
in the second trimester, at a time when progesterone levels had declined. In the 
third trimester, when progesterone levels were increasing again, the levels of
relaxin decreased, returning to basal levels by term of pregnancy. In early
pregnancy there was a parallel increase in both relaxin and LH/hCG, with the
relaxin rise in the conceptive cycle appearing sooner than in the nonconceptive
cycle, suggesting that, like chorionic gonadotropin (CG), relaxin may be a useful
and early marker for pregnancy. Unlike the situation in the human, there was no
correlation between the levels of either hormone and the number of CL detected,
infants born, mother's age, or parity. Relaxin levels increased in early
pregnancy before bioactive LH/CG, implying that relaxin is not directly regulated
by this gonadotropin. Furthermore, hCG applied to nonconceptive females during
the expected time of implantation caused an increase in progesterone but not in
relaxin concentrations. In summary, the results obtained indicate that relaxin
may be a reliable indicator of early pregnancy status in the common marmoset, but
it is independent of direct CG influence.

This study examines the effect of melengestrol acetate (MGA) implants on
reproductive function and various biochemical parameters, ovarian activity, and
uterine morphology in ten female common marmosets implanted for either 6-8 or
19-21 months. Measures of body weight, concentrations of urinary glucose and
blood liver enzymes were taken. Ovarian activity was assessed by analysis of
urinary progestin levels and ultrasound examinations of the ovaries.
Ultrasonography was also used to evaluate uterine morphology. MGA was highly
effective in preventing pregnancies in the study animals. No changes in
biochemical parameters were found; however, seven females developed a substantial
weight gain during the study. Follicular development was not suppressed, as
indicated by the presence of antral follicles, luteinized structures, and
elevated urinary progestin levels. The uteri of the MGA-treated subjects were
moderately enlarged with a thickened endometrium that showed a marked change in
structural appearance indicative of hypertrophy and decidualization. After
implant removal these changes quickly disappeared and all females ovulated within
3 weeks and conceived within 4 months post-treatment. MGA appears to be an
acceptable contraceptive in the marmoset, although non-steroidal methods should
be evaluated as possible potential alternatives.

The dopamine D3/D2 receptor agonist 7-OH-DPAT induces cognitive impairment in the
marmoset.

Smith AG(1), Neill JC, Costall B.

Author information:

Bradford, West Yorkshire, UK.

Previous work has shown that dopaminergic systems are involved in cognitive
function in the common marmoset. The present study investigated the role of
dopamine D3 receptors in cognitive performance in the marmoset. The effects of
the putative dopamine D3 receptor agonist, 7-OH-DPAT, on performance of a
same-day reversal visual object discrimination task were assessed using a
miniature Wisconsin General Test Apparatus (WGTA). Within the same test session
marmosets acquired a two-choice object discrimination initial task and a reversal
task to criterion. 7-OH-DPAT (6-10 microg/kg) significantly impaired reversal
task performance only, without affecting acquisition of the initial task. A
higher dose of 25 microg/kg 7-OH-DPAT impaired initial task acquisition as well
as reversal task acquisition, possibly as a consequence of a nonspecific
influence on motor function. The dopamine D2 receptor antagonist (-)sulpiride
(5-10 microg/kg) and the alpha2-receptor antagonist yohimbine (50 microg/kg)
failed to attenuate the effects of 7-OH-DPAT (6 microg/kg) in this task. In
contrast, the dopamine D2/D3 receptor antagonist raclopride (50 microg/kg)
significantly attenuated the 7-OH-DPAT-induced impairment of reversal task
performance. These results suggest that activation of dopamine D3 receptors
produces a selective impairment of aspects of cognitive function in the marmoset.

Model for the fetal recruitment of simian gamma-globin genes based on findings
from two New World monkeys Cebus apella and Callithrix jacchus (Platyrrhini,
Primates).

Medicine, Detroit, Michigan 48201, USA.

The originally embryonic gamma-globin locus duplicated and acquired a novel
(fetal) pattern of expression in a defined time period (55-40 million years ago) 
during primate phylogeny. The objective of this study was to determine some of
the factors that led to first the emergence of fetal gamma specificity and then
the maintenance of different fetal gamma expression patterns in extant simian
primates (e.g., human, capuchin monkey). Analyses focused on two platyrrhine (New
World monkey) species: the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) and the brown
capuchin monkey (Cebus apella), each of which has paired, non-allelic gamma loci 
(5'-gamma 1-gamma 2-3'). Quantitation of beta-type globin mRNAs expressed in a
4.5 week old embryo of Callithrix jacchus revealed that in addition to its
primary epsilon-globin message, considerable amounts of gamma 1 message and just 
trace levels of gamma 2 message are present. In contrast, analyses of
gamma-globin messenger RNAs expressed in a Cebus apella fetal liver indicated
that gamma 2 expression is at least 120 times greater than gamma 1 expression.
Using a luciferase reporter and a transient assay system, the strengths of gamma 
1 and gamma 2 promoter fragments of Cebus apella were compared in erythroid
(K562) and non-erythroid (HeLa) cell lines. Due to the lack of chromatin
repression in a transient expression system, the results do not fully
recapitulate globin expression. However, the results suggest that sequences
contained within the Cebus gamma 1 and gamma 2 proximal promoter regions (-200 to
+1 bp) can direct gamma transcription in both cell lines. In K562 and, to a
lesser extent, in HeLa cells Cebus gamma 2 promoter fragments were significantly 
stronger (P < 0.01) than gamma 1 promoter fragments. This is consistent with the 
fact that the Cebus gamma 1 promoter contains several mutations, including a
proximal CCAAT box mutation (CCAAT-->CCAAc). The epsilon-gamma 1 intergenic
distances in these platyrrhines (5.4 kb in Cebus apella and 6.9 kb in Callithrix 
jacchus) are short, supporting the inference that it was also short in the stem
simian primates. The results suggest that immediately following the gamma
duplication, the gamma 1 gene of the stem simians was still embryonic and the
downstream gamma 2 gene was largely silent. A further inference is that once
gamma 2 accumulated regulatory mutations that disrupted binding of fetal
repressors, gamma 2 was expressed fetally and, through gene conversion, passed
these characteristics to the gamma 1 gene. The fetal expression of gamma 1 is
most evident in catarrhines (Old World monkeys and hominoids), which
preferentially express the gamma 1 locus during fetal life.

Normal development of refractive state and ocular component dimensions in the
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).

Graham B(1), Judge SJ.

Refractive state and ocular dimensions were studied longitudinally in nine normal
marmosets. Animals were anaesthetised and examined (with some exceptions) at 4,
6, 7, 8, 10, 15, 24 and 39 weeks of age. Cycloplegic retinoscopy showed that
hyperopia early in life rapidly diminished. Refraction corrected for the artefact
of retinoscopy stabilised by 8 weeks of age, but at a slightly myopic value,
rather than at emmetropia. The ocular components continued to change throughout
the period studied. Corneal radius, measured by photokeratometry, increased
slightly during development. Anterior segment depth and vitreous chamber depth
(VCD), measured by A-scan ultrasonography, increased throughout development while
lens thickness initially increased and then decreased. Data from the eyes of
these normal animals were compared with that from the contralateral eyes of
animals which received short periods of monocular deprivation early in life
(Troilo, D., & Judge S.J. (1993). Ocular development and visual deprivation

while age-matched animals from the other colony were slightly but significantly
less myopic than our animals.

(1)Medical Research Council, Reproductive Biology Unit, Centre for Reproductive
Biology, Edinburgh, UK.

The concept of a safe, immunocontraceptive vaccine using the zona pellucida
glycoprotein 3 (ZP3) as an immunogen has been marred by the appearance of ovarian
dysfunction in several species. However, careful selection of epitopes on mouse
ZP3 have demonstrated that it is possible to segregate contraceptive bone
marrow-derived (B)-cell epitopes from the cytotoxic thymus-derived (T)-cell
epitopes thought to be responsible for inducing ovarian disease. B-cell epitopes 
on marmoset ZP3 (mstZP3) were identified by epitope mapping studies. Using a
panel of polyclonal antibodies against recombinant mstZP3, an immunodominant
epitope mstZP3(301-320) was identified. A chimeric peptide was co-linearly
synthesized incorporating this sequence with a promiscuous tetanus toxoid
T-helper cell epitope. Using the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) as an
animal model, we have compared the consequences of active immunization with
homologous recombinant mstZP3 and mstZP3(301-320) chimeric peptide vaccine.
Long-term infertility was achieved using mstZP3 but at the expense of ovarian
function. In contrast, no disruption to ovarian function was observed following
mstZP3(301-320) immunization. Antibodies to this peptide immunolocalized to the
zona pellucida of both marmoset and human ovarian sections and inhibited human
sperm-zona binding by approximately 60% in vitro. However, in-vivo studies
indicated that targeting a single ZP3 epitope was insufficient to reliably and
consistently achieve a contraceptive effect.

Encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), has caused the deaths of many species of
animals in zoological parks and research institutions. The Audubon Park Zoo, (New
Orleans, Louisiana, USA) attempted vaccination of several species with a killed
EMCV vaccine with mixed results. This paper reports an attempt at vaccination
against EMCV using a genetically engineered, live attenuated Mengo virus (vMC0)
at the Audubon Park Zoo and Miami Metro Zoo, (Miami, Florida, USA) from December 
1996 to June 1997. Several species of animals were vaccinated with vMC0, which is
serologically indistinguishable from the field strain of EMCV. Serum samples were
taken at the time of vaccination and again 21 days later, then submitted for
serum neutralization titers against EMCV. The vaccinate species included red
capped mangebey (Cercocebus torquatus), colobus (Colobus guereza), angolan
colobus (Colobus angolensis), ruffed lemur (Lemur variegatus ruber and Lemur
variegatus variegatus), back lemur (Lemur macaco), ring-tailed lemur (Lemur
catta), siamang (Hylobates syndactylus), diana guenon (Cercopithicus diana),
spider monkey (Ateles geoffroyi), common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), talapoin 
monkey (Cercopithecus talapoin), Brazilian tapir (Tapirus terrestris), Baird's
tapir (Tapirus bairdii), Malayan tapir (Tapirus indicus), dromedary camel

Vietnamese potbellied pig (Sus scrofa), babirusa (Babyrousa babyrussa), collard
peccary (Tayass tajacu), and African crested porcupine (Hystrix
africaeaustralis). The vaccine response was variable, with high virus
neutralizing antibody titer responses in some primate species and mixed to poor
responses for other species. No ill effects were seen with vaccination.

Effect of ambient temperature on the circadian activity rhythm in common
marmosets, Callithrix j. jacchus (primates).

Pálková M(1), Sigmund L, Erkert HG.

Czech Republic.

Whereas the (zeitgeber) effect of ambient temperature Ta and temperature cycles
TaC's on circadian rhythmicity has been well documented for heterothermic
mammals, inconsistent results have been obtained for strictly homeothermic
species. Hence, it might be inferred that the susceptibility of the mammalian
circadian timing system (CTS) to Ta and TaC's depends on the range of the
animals' core and/or brain temperature rhythm. This hypothesis was tested in the 
common marmoset (Callithrix j. jacchus, n = 12), a small diurnal primate with an 
amplitude in body temperature rhythm that is larger than for other homeothermic
primates studied so far. Within the range 20-30 degrees C, no systematic effects 
of constant Ta on most parameters of the marmosets' light-dark (LD)-entrained and
free-running circadian activity rhythm (CAR) were found. Significant differences 
could be established in the average amount of activity per circadian cycle. It
was highest at Ta 25 degrees C (LD) and 20 degrees C (light-light, LL) and most
probably reflected a temperature-induced masking effect. A 24 h trapezoidal TaC
of 20:30 degrees C entrained the free-running CAR in two of six marmosets and
produced relative coordination in all others. Accordingly, in all animals tested,
it had an effect on the CTS. In marmosets free running in LL at a Ta of 20
degrees C or 30 degrees C, 3 h warm and cold pulses of 30 degrees C and 20
degrees C, respectively, produced neither systematic phase responses nor period
responses of the CAR. So, there is no evidence of a phase-response mechanism
underlying circadian entrainment. The results show that large-amplitude TaC's
function as a weak zeitgeber for the marmosets' CTS. Since this zeitgeber effect 
is significantly larger than that found in owl monkeys, the results are
consistent with the starting hypothesis that the zeitgeber effect of a given TaC 
on the mammalian CTS may be related to the amplitude of the species' core and/or 
brain temperature cycle.

Nonhuman primate models are useful to evaluate the safety and efficacy of new
therapeutic modalities, including gene therapy, before the inititation of
clinical trials in humans. With the aim of establishing safe and effective
approaches to therapeutic gene transfer, we have been focusing on a small New
World monkey, the common marmoset, as a target preclinical model. This animal is 
relatively inexpensive and easy to breed in limited space. First, we
characterized marmoset blood and bone marrow progenitor cells (BMPCs) and showed 
that human cytokines were effective to maintain and stimulate in culture. We then
examined their susceptibility to transduction by retroviral vectors. In a mixed
culture system containing both marmoset stromal cells and retroviral producer
cells, the transduction efficiency into BMPCs and peripheral blood progenitor
cells (PBPCs) was 12% to 24%. A series of marmosets then underwent
transplantation with autologous PBPCs transduced with a retroviral vector
carrying the multidrug resistance 1 gene (MDR1) and were followed for the
persistence of these cells in vivo. Proviral DNA was detectable by polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) in peripheral blood granulocytes and lymphocytes in the
recipients of gene transduced progenitors up to 400 days posttransplantation. To 
examine the function of the MDR1 gene in vivo, recipient maromsets were
challenged with docetaxel, an MDR effluxed drug, yet the overall level of gene
transfer attained in vivo (<1% in peripheral blood granulocytes) was not
sufficient to prevent the neutropenia induced by docetaxel treatment. Using this 
model, we safely and easily performed a series of in vivo studies in our small
animal center. Our results show that this small nonhuman primate, the common
marmoset, is a useful model for the evaluation of gene transfer methods targeting
hematopoietic stem cells.

University of Barcelona, Bellaterra, Spain.

A five-year-old female common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) died after a
one-month clinical course of nonspecific signs. Pathologic findings were acute
diffuse fibrinonecrotizing enteritis and granulomatous endolymphangitis of
intestinal and mesenteric lymphatic vessels. Both lesions were associated with a 
marked proliferation of Mayer's mucicarmine-positive, 4 to 15 microm yeasts that 
were surrounded by a wide clear halo. The infection was probably acquired by oral
route. Other findings included moderate multifocal granulomatous and necrotizing 
hepatitis and mesangial nephropathy. Although the immunological status of this
marmoset was unknown, cryptococcosis might induce primary lethal intestinal
infections in callitrichids.

The STP oncoproteins of the herpesvirus saimiri (HVS) subgroup A strain 11 and
subgroup C strain 488 are now found to be stably associated with tumor necrosis
factor receptor-associated factor (TRAF) 1, 2, or 3. Mutational analyses
identified residues of PXQXT/S in STP-A11 as critical for TRAF association. In
addition, a somewhat divergent region of STP-C488 is critical for TRAF
association. Mutational analysis also revealed that STP-C488 induced NF-kappaB
activation that was correlated with its ability to associate with TRAFs. The HVS 
STP-C488 P10-->R mutant was deficient in human T-lymphocyte transformation to
interleukin-2-independent growth but showed wild-type phenotype for marmoset
T-lymphocyte transformation in vitro and in vivo. The STP-C488 P10-->R mutant was
also defective in Rat-1 fibroblast transformation, and fibroblast cell
transformation was blocked by a TRAF2 dominant-negative mutant. These data
implicate TRAFs in STP-C488-mediated transformation of human lymphocytes and
rodent fibroblasts. Other factors are implicated in immortalization of common
marmoset T lymphocytes and may also be critical in the transformation of human
lymphocytes and rodent fibroblasts.

New hyperprolactinemia and anovulation model in common marmoset (Callithrix
jacchus) and effect of cabergoline.

We aimed to develop an anovulation model, using sulpiride-induced
hyperprolactinemia in common marmosets. The serum prolactin level gradually
increased during the twice-daily administration of sulpiride and reached a
plateau after 4 days. Sulpiride produced as big a response at 10 mg kg(-1) as at 
50 mg kg(-1). In this study, the length of the ovarian cycle was approximately 30
days in normal common marmosets. Serum progesterone and estradiol levels showed
no consistent change during the first 2 months of treatment with sulpiride. When 
treatment with sulpiride had been continued for more than 2 months, serum
progesterone and estradiol levels fell to within the range seen in the follicular
phase of the normal cycle and absence of ovulation was recognized by laparoscopy.
A single oral administration of cabergoline (at doses between 0.01 and 0.1 mg
kg(-1)) dose dependently reduced the elevated serum prolactin level.
Bromocriptine (at an oral dose of 10 mg kg(-1)) also reduced the serum prolactin 
level at 4 and 8 h after its administration. With bromocriptine, the prolactin
level had recovered at 24 h, but with cabergoline at doses of 0.05 mg kg(-1) or
more, it had still not recovered at 48 h. In anovulatory common marmosets, oral
administration of cabergoline at a daily dose of 0.05 mg kg(-1) restored ovarian 
function and resulted in ovulation in 100% of the group (following a reduction in
the serum prolactin level). Bromocriptine at a daily oral dose of 10 mg kg(-1)
resulted in ovulation in 67% of the group, but this dose was about 200 times
higher than the dose of cabergoline. We could produce an anovulatory model
induced by sulpiride repeatedly administered over a long time period. It is
suggested that, in this anovulatory model in common marmosets, cabergoline has a 
potent and long-lasting action as a dopamine D2 receptor agonist, and thus could 
be a useful drug for the treatment of galactorrhea and hyperprolactinemic
amenorrhea and/or anovulation.

Growth variation in common marmoset monkeys (Callithrix jacchus) fed a purified
diet: relation to care-giving and weaning behaviors.

Significant relations were observed between select infant-care and weaning
behaviors and growth in body weight in common marmoset monkeys (Callithrix
jacchus). The patterns of these relations suggest that earlier occurrence of
developmental milestones, such as cessation of transport (being off carriers) and
weaning to solid food, were associated with slower growth during the subsequent
period. In contrast, more frequent nursing bouts during the period in which
weaning was initiated were associated with higher growth rates. In the case of
being off carriers, these effects did not carry over to older ages, suggesting
that any deficits in growth were temporary. In the case of earlier, more frequent
consumption of solid food, there was some suggestion that there were longer-term 
effects, followed by catch-up growth. The knee-to-heel length of subjects was not
related to the measured behaviors. There was no relation between early weaning to
solid food and leanness at day 75, suggesting that, although this behavior was
affecting overall weight, it did not affect relative gains of fat versus lean
mass. There were, however, significant correlations between cessation of
transport or frequency of nursing bouts during the weaning period and leanness,
with earlier cessation of transport and less frequent nursing associated with
leaner infants, after weaning. Our results differed from those of a previous
study that found a relation between linear growth and abuse in this species, with
abuse defined as physical injury by other members of the group. We found no
differences in growth between abused and nonabused infants. However, abused
infants had lower birth weight.

Age-related changes in the brainstem auditory evoked potentials of the marmoset.

Harada T(1), Tokuriki M, Tanioka Y.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Veterinary Medicine, Faculty of Agriculture, Yamaguchi
University, Japan.

Changes in brain-stem auditory evoked potentials (BAEPs) with age were recorded
in common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) at the age of 1-2, 6-8 and 10-12 years. 
The auditory function was assessed by thresholds, latencies and amplitudes of
BAEPs evoked by use of tone burst stimulations with audible frequencies ranging
from 1 to 99 kHz. Prolongation of the latencies of later waves was observed in
the animals at the age of 6-8 and 10-12 years at high frequencies, suggesting
that aging in marmosets, as reported previously in humans and other animals, may 
cause earlier hearing loss at high frequency than at low frequency within the
hearing range. At 10-12 years of age, the elevations of BAEP thresholds and the
declines of BAEP amplitudes in older animals were also observed. As the
differences in the parameters are small, it was suggested that only a moderate
hearing loss occurred with onset late in life in common marmoset similar to that 
in CBA/Ca mice. Based on the results obtained in this study, BAEP latencies
appear to be more sensitive indicators than BAEP thresholds and amplitudes for
the early detection of hearing impairment.

Callithrix jacchus, the common marmoset, is a small New World primate that feeds 
on insects, fruit, and gum, and has a high reproductive rate for a primate.
Insects are generally a poor source of dietary calcium, while gums may contain
significant levels of calcium. Their high reproductive rate also suggests that
reproductive female C. jacchus might be susceptible to calcium deficiency. Thus, 
we hypothesized that common marmosets might find solutions containing calcium to 
be palatable. We used choice experiments to examine this phenomenon in 14 male
and 19 female common marmosets. Animals were presented with identical water
bottles containing either deionized water or a calcium lactate solution (either
2% or 4% calcium lactate by weight) and intake was measured. Serum 25-OH-vitamin 
D was monitored in a subset of the animals in the experiment to examine the role 
of vitamin D in this behavior. Our results demonstrated that C. jacchus can
distinguish between plain water and a calcium lactate solution, and that in
general they prefer calcium solutions. Although animals with marginal vitamin D
status did have strong preferences for calcium solutions, they did not ingest
significantly more of the calcium solutions than animals that were vitamin
D-replete. Nulliparous females and males did not differ in the amounts of calcium
solutions ingested. Lactating females ingested the greatest volume of the calcium
solutions.

Effects of separation and novelty on distress vocalizations and cortisol in the
common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).

In socially-bonding species, separation from familiar attachment figures is
widely known to stimulate a physiological and behavioral stress response. This
study investigated the hormonal and vocal responses of adult common marmosets to 
separation from familiar group members and to 24 hr of cohabitation with an
unfamiliar opposite-sex conspecific. All subjects were removed from their home
cages and placed into a novel environment for 20 min. In one group, marmosets
were exposed to an unfamiliar, opposite-sex partner in the novel environment and 
remained paired with this partner for the 24 hr test period. In three other
groups, marmosets experienced the novel environment alone and subsequently were
returned to their original social- or single-housing condition, or kept separate 
from their social groups for a 24 h period. Blood samples were collected the day 
before, and at 30 min, 90 min, and at 24 h after separation. Cortisol responses
were differentially affected by the length of separation and the presence of
unfamiliar conspecifics. Brief separation followed by the return to the social
group had minimal effect on plasma cortisol levels. All marmosets produced high
levels of separation calls in the novel environment, but there was no apparent
relationship between calling and cortisol levels. The lack of a temporal
relationship between the production of distress vocalizations and serum cortisol 
has previously been noted in squirrel monkey and rhesus monkey infant separation 
studies; the behavioral and physiological responses to separation appear to be
similarly dissociated in the marmoset. Further, the characteristics of a
separation environment can differentially affect the hormonal response by adult
marmosets without differentially affecting their behavioral response.

Anatomical structure and surface epithelial distribution in the nasal cavity of
the common cotton-eared marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).

(1)Mitsubishi Chemical Safety Institute Ltd., Ibaraki, Japan.

To validate use of the common cotton-eared marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) in
inhalation toxicity studies, its nasal morphology was examined. The nasal
turbinates each consisted of one maxilloturbinate and one ethmoturbinate: these
were more planar in structure than the comparable structures of rodents or dogs. 
The nasal cavity epithelia comprised squamous epithelium (SE), nasal transitional
epithelium (NTE), respiratory epithelium (RE) and olfactory epithelium (OE),
listed in order of occurrence from anterior to posterior positions. NTE was
distributed as a narrow band lying between SE and RE. OE was limited to the
dorsal part of the cavity, which was structurally similar to that of the macaque 
or man. Overall, this study revealed structural the similarity of the whole nasal
cavity in the marmoset to that of macaques or humans. Prediction of nasal cavity 
changes in man based on extrapolation from experimentally induced changes in the 
common marmoset therefore seems likely to be feasible, making it a useful animal 
model for inhalation studies.

Blockade of the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis with a GnRH antagonist in 
the neonatal marmoset monkey: changes in Leydig cell ultrastructure.

Prince FP(1), Mann DR, Fraser HM.

(1)Department of Natural Science, Plymouth State College, NH 03264, USA.

Little is known of the cell biology of Leydig cells during the neonatal
activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular (HPT) axis. The current study
examined the effect of blockade of the HPT axis with a GnRH antagonist (antide)
on the neonatal population of Leydig cells in the new world primate, the common
marmoset. Three sets of twins, age 7 weeks, were studied: in each pair one twin
was used as a control, while the other received treatment with GnRH antagonist
from the day of birth to suppress pituitary gonadotrophin secretion. Leydig cells
of treated animals were dramatically different from those of controls. The cells 
were atrophic and exhibited very irregular nuclei. The organelles involved in
steroid synthesis were reduced to the extent to being barely evident. The smooth 
endoplasmic reticulum (SER) was greatly diminished in quantity and distribution. 
The usual form of the SER (anastomosing tubules) was not evident, but, instead,
the SER was relatively unbranched. Peroxisomes, organelles involved in transfer
of cholesterol to the mitochondria, were greatly reduced in number. Mitochondria 
were relatively sparse and exhibited a non-typical morphology, as tubular
elements of the cristae were rarely evident. Thus, the central apparatus in
steroid production, the SER, mitochondria and peroxisomes, was essentially shut
down in the GnRH-antagonist-treated animals. Storage of cholesterol, the
precursor of steroid biosynthesis, was also not in evidence, as lipid droplets
were extremely rare. Two prominent features of control in neonatal marmoset
Leydig cells, the membranofibrillar inclusion (MFI) and basal laminae, remain
prominent in the Leydig cells of treated animals. Evidence of apoptosis was not
observed. These results provide strong support that the gonadotrophic hormones
are the primary regulator of neonatal Leydig cell development in primates, and
also suggest cell regression, rather than apoptosis, being the mechanism of this 
inhibition.

Definition of the immune process that causes demyelination in multiple sclerosis 
is essential to determine the feasibility of Ag-directed immunotherapy. Using the
nonhuman primate, Callithrix jacchus jacchus (common marmoset), we show that
immunization with myelin basic protein and proteolipid protein determinants
results in clinical disease with significant demyelination. Demyelination was
associated with spreading to myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)
determinants that generated anti-MOG serum Abs and Ig deposition in central
nervous system white matter lesions. These data associate intermolecular
"determinant spreading" with clinical autoimmune disease in primates and raise
important issues for the pathogenesis and treatment of multiple sclerosis.

Gustatory responses of the common marmoset were studied using single fiber
recordings from chorda tympani (CT) nerve and two bottle preference (TBP) tests. 
Hierarchical cluster analysis of 43 fibers' response profiles revealed 3 major
clusters of fibers characterized by predominant sensitivity to sweeteners (S
cluster), bitter compounds (Q cluster) or acids (H cluster). NaCl as well as LiCl
did not stimulate CT taste fibers. The TBP tests showed relationship between a
compound's ability to stimulate the taste fibers and the animals' consumption.
Activity in the S cluster was associated with preference, while the activity in
the Q cluster was associated with rejection. Marmosets neither preferred nor
rejected sweeteners which did not stimulate any CT fibers.

Two methods of measuring body temperature were compared in common marmosets.
Subcutaneous temperatures were measured remotely via previously implanted
subcutaneous microchips (Plexx BV, IPTT-100) prior to measurement of rectal
temperature using a conventional rectal probe. Marmosets were treated with saline
or the brain penetrant, 5-HT1A/B/D receptor agonist SKF-99101H
(3-(2-dimethylaminoethyl)-4-chloro-5-propoxyindole hemifumarate) (0.3-3 mg/kg
SC), which has previously been shown to induce hypothermia in guinea pigs. Body
temperature was sampled immediately before drug administration and at 30-min
intervals thereafter for a period of 2.5 h. SKF-99101H dose-dependently induced
hypothermia in the common marmoset and there was close agreement between rectal
and subcutaneous body temperatures, with an average difference in absolute body
temperature of 0.26+/-0.02 degrees C. The data show that subcutaneously implanted
microchips provide a simple, reliable measure of body temperature in common
marmosets which is sensitive to pharmacological intervention, minimizes handling 
induced stress, and is minimally invasive.

Pharmacological characterisation of dopamine overflow in the striatum of the
normal and MPTP-treated common marmoset, studied in vivo using fast cyclic
voltammetry, nomifensine and sulpiride.

The in vivo measurement of electrically-evoked dopamine overflow was measured for
the first time in the striatum of control and
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-treated common marmosets using fast 
cyclic voltammetry at untreated carbon-fibre microelectrodes, (7 microm, o.d.).
The identity of dopamine was confirmed using electrochemical, pharmacological and
histological criteria and complied with rat data from earlier studies. Dopamine
overflow depended on the intensity, number of pulses, and frequency of the
applied stimuli. Maximum dopamine overflow occurred using 1.0-2.0 mA, 200 micros 
pulse width, 150-200 pulses at 80-120 Hz stimulation of the medial forebrain
bundle. Evoked dopamine overflow in
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-treated marmosets showed a similar
electrochemical and pharmacological profile compared to healthy controls, albeit 
the concentration detected was significantly reduced. The catecholamine uptake
blocker, nomifensine, significantly increased the dopamine signal in control
marmosets. However, in contrast, nomifensine had no significant effect on evoked 
dopamine overflow in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-treated
marmosets. Apart from demonstrating that fast cyclic voltammetry with electrical 
stimulation can be reliably used to monitor dopamine overflow within the primate 
brain, our results describe for the first time the technical prerequisites for
the fast cyclic voltammetric technique in the non-human primate brain.

Perseveration and strategy in a novel spatial self-ordered sequencing task for
nonhuman primates: effects of excitotoxic lesions and dopamine depletions of the 
prefrontal cortex.

Damage to the prefrontal cortex disrupts the performance of self-ordered
sequencing tasks, although the precise mechanisms by which this effect occurs is 
unclear. Active working memory, inhibitory control, and the ability to generate
and perform a sequence of responses are all putative cognitive abilities that may
be responsible for the impaired performance that results from disruption of
prefrontal processing. In addition, the neurochemical substrates underlying
prefrontal cognitive function are not well understood, although active working
memory appears to depend upon an intact mesocortical dopamine system. The present
experiments were therefore designed to evaluate explicitly the contribution of
each of these abilities to successful performance of a novel spatial self-ordered
sequencing task and to examine the contribution of the prefrontal cortex and its 
dopamine innervation to each ability in turn. Excitotoxic lesions of the
prefrontal cortex of the common marmoset profoundly impaired the performance of
the self-ordered sequencing task and induced robust perseverative responding.
Task manipulations that precluded perseveration ameliorated the effect of this
lesion and revealed that the ability to generate and perform sequences of
responses was unaffected by excitotoxic damage to prefrontal cortex. In contrast,
large dopamine and noradrenaline depletions within the same areas of prefrontal
cortex had no effect on any aspect of the self-ordered task but did impair the
acquisition of an active working memory task, spatial delayed response, to the
same degree as the excitotoxic lesion. These results demonstrate that a lesion of
the ascending monoamine projections to the prefrontal cortex is not always
synonymous with a lesion of the prefrontal cortex itself and thereby challenge
existing concepts concerning the neuromodulation of prefrontal cognitive
function.

Lateralized use of the mouth in production of vocalizations by marmosets.

mhkcstgn@msuv1.memphis.edu

We have found that the common marmoset, Callithrix jacchus, displays a larger
left hemimouth during production of fear expressions, with or without
vocalization, and a larger right hemimouth when producing a social contact call. 
Thus, marmosets have right hemisphere specialization for the production of
negative emotional expressions and vocalizations and left hemisphere
specialization for the production of social contact communication. These
hemispheric specializations for social communication in marmosets are the same as
those found in humans for speech production and for the control of emotional
expressions. We suggest that hemispheric specializations for communication in
humans may well have precursors in primate evolution.

Mammalian oocytes can be induced to resume meiosis without fertilization, and the
resulting parthenogenetic embryos carry only maternal chromosomes. Human oocytes 
can be activated by many chemical and physical stimuli, but postimplantation
studies of human parthenogenetic embryos are not ethically acceptable. The common
marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus) is a good model for studying primate
parthenogenetic development postimplantation, since follicular aspiration, embryo
transfer, and early postimplantation development of biparental embryos have
already been described. Marmoset oocytes were either subjected to two series of
six electrical pulses (DC; 2 kV/cm and 70 microsec) or were incubated in 7%
ethanol in PBS. Ninety-two percent (68 of 74) and 20% (8 of 40) of marmoset
oocytes were activated by electrical stimulus or ethanol, respectively.
Parthenogenetic (n = 3) or in vitro-fertilized (n = 2) embryos were transferred
at the 4-cell stage to synchronized recipient female marmosets (n = 5).
Progesterone, chorionic gonadotropin, and inhibin in the peripheral plasma of
recipient animals were measured. After 33 days of gestation, recipient animals
were perfused and the uteri were collected. The 2 females that had received
biparental embryos and 2 of the 3 females that had received parthenogenetic
embryos displayed biochemical and histological evidence of implantation. This is 
the first report that a primate embryo comprising only parthenogenetic cells is
capable of implantation. This highlights the need to scrutinize levels of
parthenogenesis associated with human assisted reproductive technologies.
Marmoset parthenogenones also provide a unique model for elucidating the roles of
parental genomes in primate development.

In singular cooperatively breeding mammals, social status is a key determinant of
female reproductive success. Usually only one dominant female breeds in a social 
group. In the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a cooperatively breeding
primate, adaptations to nonbreeding subordinate status appear to parallel those
found in social insect societies which demonstrate similar skew to the marmoset
in female reproductive success. Female marmosets exhibit rank-related polyethism 
in behavior, reproductive neuroendocrinology and non-reproductive physiology, and
subordinates participate in alloparental care and territory defense. Olfactory,
visual and behavioral cues from dominant female marmosets provide important
proximate cues regulating ovarian inhibition in female subordinates.
Cooperatively breeding marmosets, therefore, appear to have developed specific
neural and neuroendocrine adaptations to subordinate social status analogous to
those found in social insects such as the lower wasps, bees and termites. Such
parallel developments probably reflect the outcome of repeated convergent
evolutionary attempts at adapting to environmental conditions not readily
conducive to dispersal and independent breeding.

The milk ejection reflex is mediated by the release of pituitary oxytocin and its
interaction with specific receptors within the mammary gland. Although
up-regulation of the oxytocin receptor during lactation has been shown for the
rat mammary gland by ligand binding assay, investigation of the receptor
expression in human breast at the molecular level has not yet been carried out in
detail. Here we report the expression and immunolocalization of the oxytocin
receptor in the human breast. It appears that the expression level of the
receptor-specific mRNA is not significantly elevated during lactation and the
protein remains at a relatively low level. However, this lack of increase may be 
only a dilution effect because of the high level of milk protein expression.
Immunohistochemistry and immunoelectron microscopy using three anti-oxytocin
receptor antibodies raised against different epitopes of the receptor indicated
the presence of receptor immunoreactivity only to a very limited extent in the
myoepithelial cells; more specific expression appeared to occur in the
ductal/glandular epithelium in both the non-lactating as well as lactating
breast. This finding was also confirmed in a New World monkey, the common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). These results suggest that, at least for human and
marmoset, in addition to--or even instead of--myoid cells, the ductal/glandular
epithelium is also a target for oxytocin action, not only during lactation but
also in the non-lactating breast. Thus, there may be other physiological effects 
of oxytocin besides direct myoid cell contraction in the breast.

[Dermal application of lisuride on parkinsonism induced by

Dermal administration is a nonoral drug delivery system that can keep the
concentration of a drug in the body at a proper level for a long time. This is
suitable especially in patients in the advanced stages of Parkinson's disease
with a wearing-off phenomenon (short duration of effects on antiparkinsonian
drugs), or in postoperative patients who cannot be treated with oral
administration. We studied the effects of lisuride, a dopamine receptor agonist, 
in the dermal application on MPTP-treated common marmosets and on 5 patients with
Parkinson's disease. Lisuride was applied to 4 x 5 cm of skin of the abdomen of
monkeys. In patients with Parkinson's disease, lisuride was applied to the skin
of the chest. The agent reversed akinesia of MPTP-treated animals within 30 min
following the application and relieved the animal of parkinsonism for 5 days at a
dose of 2 mg/kg. In patients, the dermal application of lisuride increased the
duration of the ON period at doses of 1 to 2 mg/kg. These results suggest that
the dermal application of lisuride is a useful treatment in parkinsonism.

The patterns of expression of sugar residues in the olfactory epithelium and
vomeronasal organ of the common marmoset were studied lectin-histochemically.
Eight lectins including DBA, BSL-I, RCA-I, s-WGA, PNA, ECL, UEA-I and Con A bound
to the free border of the olfactory epithelium, and 6 lectins including DBA,
RCA-I, s-WGA, PNA, ECL and UEA-I bound to that of the vomeronasal organ. UEA-I
bound to all dendrites of the olfactory receptor cells, and 6 lectins including
BSL-I, RCA-I, s-WGA, PNA, ECL and Con A bound to only a part of dendrites of the 
olfactory receptor cells. ECL and UEA-I bound to all dendrites of the vomeronasal
receptor cells, and s-WGA, PNA and Con A bound to only a part of dendrites of the
vomeronasal receptor cells. Seven lectins including RCA-I, s-WGA, BSL-II, PNA,
ECL, UEA-I and Con A bound to all the olfactory receptor cell bodies, and BSL-I
bound to only a part of them. Six lectins including RCA-I, s-WGA, PNA, ECL, UEA-I
and Con A bound to all the vomeronasal receptor cell bodies, and BSL-II bound to 
only a part of them. These results showed that a smaller number of lectins bound 
to the free border, dendrites and cell bodies of the receptor cells in the
vomeronasal organ than those in the olfactory epithelium, suggesting that the
vomeronasal organ is less active in some physiological functions with which sugar
residues are associated than the olfactory epithelium in the common marmoset.

Diurnal variation on the excretion patterns of fecal steroids in common marmoset 
(Callithrix jacchus) females.

The use of fecal steroid analysis to assess gonadal and adrenal function in
primates has rapidly increased in recent years due to the ability to collect
feces from nonhuman primates living in wild conditions. These techniques offer an
exciting new potential for enhancing our knowledge of the endocrine status of
free-living animals. Prior to using these techniques under field conditions, it
is important to determine the diurnal variation of fecal excreted steroids for
assessing possible time limitations on fecal collections. The following study
investigates the diurnal frequency of defecation and patterns of steroid levels
excreted in feces from four female common marmosets, Callithrix jacchus, living
in a family group. These females represented three reproductive conditions: early
pregnancy, ovarian cycling, and noncycling (postpubertal). Cortisol, estradiol,
and progesterone were extracted and analyzed by enzyme immunoassay. Diurnal
variations in steroid levels were found by ANOVA for cortisol and progesterone
but not for estradiol. Significantly higher levels of cortisol were found in the 
afternoon, while the reverse was found for progesterone. All females showed the
same pattern of steroid level change, except for cortisol in the pregnant female.
Since all females defecated within the first hour after they awoke in the
morning, this time was determined to be the most effective time to collect feces.
The consistency of our findings reinforces the usefulness of this approach for
studying reproductive and adrenocortical function in marmosets and also indicates
that fecal collection should be limited to either morning or afternoon
collections.

Assisted reproductive techniques are needed urgently to facilitate the captive
breeding of many New World primate species which are endangered in the wild and
to assist the effective genetic management of small colonies. A protocol was
devised for artificial insemination in the common marmoset, Callithrix jacchus,
using ejaculated sperm obtained by vaginal washing after copulation. A double
insemination protocol was employed, with the first insemination taking place the 
day before ovulation was expected to occur and the second 48 h later. All six
females inseminated with fresh ejaculated sperm became pregnant, delivering a
total of 16 offspring at term. The gestation lengths and litter sizes were not
statistically different from those observed in pregnancies following natural
mating. The insemination protocol was adapted for use with cryopreserved
ejaculated sperm by including an additional insemination on the day of expected
ovulation, to take into account differences in the capacitation time of
frozen-thawed sperm compared to fresh sperm. Three out of six females inseminated
according to this triple insemination schedule, conceived, although one female
subsequently resorbed twin foetuses approximately 100 days later. The remaining
two pregnant females delivered four babies at term, one singleton and one set of 
triplets. In the final group, six females were inseminated with low doses of
cryopreserved epididymal sperm using the same triple insemination protocol used
for frozen-thawed ejaculated sperm. One female conceived, delivering triplets.

The common marmoset: a new world primate species with limited Mhc class II
variability.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a New World primate species that is
highly susceptible to fatal infections caused by various strains of bacteria. We 
present here a first step in the molecular characterization of the common
marmoset's Mhc class II genes by nucleotide sequence analysis of the polymorphic 
exon 2 segments. For this study, genetic material was obtained from animals bred 
in captivity as well as in the wild. The results demonstrate that the common
marmoset has, like other primates, apparently functional Mhc-DR and -DQ regions, 
but the Mhc-DP region has been inactivated. At the -DR and -DQ loci, only a
limited number of lineages were detected. On the basis of the number of alleles
found, the -DQA and -B loci appear to be oligomorphic, whereas only a moderate
degree of polymorphism was observed for two of three Mhc-DRB loci. The contact
residues in the peptide-binding site of the Caja-DRB1*03 lineage members are
highly conserved, whereas the -DRB*W16 lineage members show more divergence in
that respect. The latter locus encodes five oligomorphic lineages whose members
are not observed in any other primate species studied, suggesting rapid
evolution, as illustrated by frequent exchange of polymorphic motifs. All common 
marmosets tested were found to share one monomorphic type of Caja-DRB*W12 allele 
probably encoded by a separate locus. Common marmosets apparently lack haplotype 
polymorphism because the number of Caja-DRB loci present per haplotype appears to
be constant. Despite this, however, an unexpectedly high number of allelic
combinations are observed at the haplotypic level, suggesting that Caja-DRB
alleles are exchanged frequently between chromosomes by recombination, promoting 
an optimal distribution of limited Mhc polymorphisms among individuals of a given
population. This peculiar genetic make up, in combination with the limited
variability of the major histocompatability complex class II repertoire, may
contribute to the common marmoset's susceptibility to particular bacterial
infections.

Immunoreactive riboflavin carrier protein concentration during ovulatory cycle in
the common marmoset (Callithrix jachhus): role of estrogen.

Natraj U(1), Pereira J.

Author information:

Common marmoset, a non-human primate, is increasingly being used as a model
system in reproductive endocrinology. Marmosets do not menstruate but have normal
cycle length of 28 +/- 2 days. The presence of protein immunologically and
functionally similar to the well characterized chicken riboflavin carrier protein
(cRCP) has been demonstrated in circulation in pregnant marmosets. Marmoset RCP
(mRCP) has been partially purified and the molecular weight of the immunoreactive
protein is similar to cRCP. The source of RCP in rodents appears to be maternal
liver, suggesting thereby that RCP levels could be modulated by changing hormonal
pattern that occurs during the cycle. To study the hormonal control of marmoset
RCP, immunoreactive RCP levels were monitored during normal cycle. Plasma
progesterone was estimated by RIA and mRCP was measured using a heterologous cRCP
RIA. When mRCP and progesterone were analysed for a period of 40 days (n = 5) in 
adult females, very low amount of mRCP was measured during the luteal phase and a
single sharp peak was observed during the follicular phase of the cycle. These
data suggested that the induction of mRCP was regulated by estrogen. Direct
evidence for the role of estrogen in the elaboration of RCP, was the observation 
that exogenous administration of estradiol 17 B to immature marmosets resulted in
a time and dose dependent increase in plasma RCP levels. As early as 24 hr
following hormonal administration, a measurable increase in mRCP with a maximum
increase, 5-fold over the zero period was seen 3 days following a single
administration of estradiol 17 B (5 mg/kg body wt). RCP levels declined
thereafter and was indistinguishable by day 7. These studies indicate that the
marmoset RCP levels are regulated by estrogen.

Unusual case of metabolic bone disease in a common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).

Hatt JM(1), Sainsbury AW.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Zoo Animals and Exotic Pets, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine,
University of Zurich, Switzerland.

Metabolic bone disease was diagnosed in an 11-month-old female common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus). It was depressed, reluctant to move, and was cachectic and 
small for its age. Laboratory findings included anaemia, azotaemia and an inverse
calcium to phosphorus ratio. The radiological findings showed simultaneous signs 
of osteomalacia and soft-tissue calcification. There was decreased bone density
with lytic areas in the pelvis and femur, and severe bilateral nephrocalcinosis. 
Postmortem examination revealed marked focal dystrophic calcification of the epi-
and myocardium. Calcium and vitamin D3 deficiency (nutritional secondary
hyperparathyroidism) was the most likely cause of the osteomalacia.

Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in the common marmoset, a nonhuman
primate species (Callithrix jacchus), is a new model for multiple sclerosis.
Given the close immunological relationship between marmosets and humans, it is an
attractive model for investigating immunopathological pathways relevant to
multiple sclerosis and to evaluate new treatments for the disease. Unlike in the 
originally documented model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis induced
without the use of Bordetella pertussis led to a chronic disease of moderate
severity. The clinical course of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in the
present model was mainly chronic and progressive, but periods of incomplete
remission did occur. At the chronic stage of the disease, actively demyelinating 
lesions were found together with inactive demyelinated and remyelinated (shadow) 
plaques. Before immunization and during clinically active experimental autoimmune
encephalomyelitis, T1- and T2-weighted magnetic resonance brain images were
obtained. Correlation of the data from the magnetic resonance images and the
neuropathology analysis revealed that the hyperintense regions in T2-weighted
images represented both active and inactive remyelinating lesions. Quantification
showed that the number of lesions in T2-weighted magnetic resonance images
equalled those found by pathological examination, and thus T2-weighted magnetic
resonance imaging can be used to discern the total lesion load. Extravasation of 
gadolinium-diethylenetriamine-penta-acetic acid (triple dose) was found only in
lesions, which by histopathology were shown to be engaged in the process of
active demyelination.

Immunization of common marmosets with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) envelope
glycoprotein gp340: effect on viral shedding following EBV challenge.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), the cause of infectious mononucleosis, is involved in
the pathogenesis of several human cancers, the highest frequency of association
being found in undifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma and endemic Burkitt's
lymphoma. The development of animal models in which potential vaccines can be
tested is important. EBV infection of the common marmoset, using the M81 strain
originally derived from a patient with nasopharyngeal carcinoma, induces a
carrier state in this animal. Persistent infection is characterized by the
production of antibodies to viral antigens, and the secretion of EBV DNA into
buccal fluids. Following immunization with envelope glycoprotein gp340 derived
from a bovine papilloma virus expression vector, prior to EBV infection, viral
DNA was detected significantly less frequently in the buccal fluids of immunized,
than of nonimmunized, infected animals, indicating that although the carrier
state had not been abolished, it had been altered. A reduction in virus load was 
also observed when offspring of seronegative, and on occasion seropositive,
parents were immunized neonatally, before EBV challenge.

A role for herpesvirus saimiri orf14 in transformation and persistent infection.

The product of open reading frame 14 (orf14) of herpesvirus saimiri (HVS)
exhibits significant homology with mouse mammary tumor virus superantigen. orf14 
encodes a 50-kDa secreted glycoprotein, as shown previously (Z. Yao, E.
Maraskovsky, M. K. Spriggs, J. I. Cohen, R. J. Armitage, and M. R. Alderson, J.
Immunol. 156:3260-3266, 1996). orf14 expressed from recombinant baculovirus
powerfully induces proliferation of CD4-positive cells originating from several
different species. To study the role of orf14 in transformation, a mutant form of
HVS (HVS Deltaorf14) was constructed with a deletion in the orf14 gene. The
transforming potential of HVS Deltaorf14 was tested in cell culture and in common
marmosets. Parental HVS subgroup C strain 488 immortalized common marmoset T
lymphocytes in vitro to interleukin-2-independent growth, while the HVS
Deltaorf14 mutant did not produce such a growth transformation. In addition, HVS 
Deltaorf14 was nononcogenic in common marmosets. In contrast to other
nononcogenic HVS mutant viruses which were repeatedly isolated from peripheral
blood mononuclear cells of infected marmosets for more than 5 months, HVS
Deltaorf14 did not persist at a high level in vivo. These results demonstrate
that orf14 of HVS is not required for replication but is required for
transformation and for high-level persistence in vivo.

Tularemia in a common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) diagnosed by 16S rRNA
sequencing.

(1)Institute of Animal Pathology, University of Bern, Switzerland.

We report a case of tularemia in a common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) diagnosed
by determination of the isolate's 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequence.
Pathological examination of the animal revealed a multifocal acute necrotizing
hepatitis, interstitial nephritis, splenitis, and lymphangitis of the mandibular,
retropharyngeal, and cervical and mesenteric lymph nodes. Moreover, multiple foci
of acute necrosis were found in the epithelium of the jejunum and the
interstitium of the lung. Bacteriological investigations revealed a septicemia.
The isolated infectious agent was uncommon, not routinely diagnosed in our
laboratory and therefore difficult to identify by conventional tools in a
reasonable time and effort. thus, we decided to perform a genetic analysis based 
on the 16S rRNA gene sequence. Thereby, an infection with Francisella tularensis,
the causative agent of tularemia, was unambiguously diagnosed. This shows the
great advantage 16S rRNA gene sequencing has as a general identification approach
for unusual or rare isolates.

The stereospecific form of the known acetylenic mechanism-based MAO-inhibitor
AGN1135 (Rasagiline, TVP-1012) is devoid of sympathomimetic amphetamine-like
properties. To evaluate the efficiency and selectivity of subcutaneous injections
of TVP-1012 (dose range from 0.01 up to 10 mg/kg for 7 days) the activities of
monoamine oxidases A and B (MAO-A,-B) were determined in different brain regions 
of the common marmoset. At a dose of 0.1 mg/kg TVP-1012, almost 80% of MAO-B
activity is inhibited in all brain regions investigated (prefrontal and occipital
cortex, cerebellum, caudate nucleus, putamen, nucleus accumbens). In contrast,
MAO-A is not inhibited in putamen and nucleus accumbens. However, by increasing
the TVP-1012 dose to 0.5 mg/kg, MAO-A is inhibited to a significant extent as
well, concomitant to total inhibition of MAO-B. The results obtained indicate
that TVP-1012 irreversibly inhibits both types of MAO in the common marmoset with
selectivity for MAO-B at doses less than 0.5 mg/kg. TVP-1012 could be useful in
studies requiring selective MAO-B inhibition without concomitant sympathomimetic 
amphetamine-like effects and could thus be of therapeutic interest for
Parkinson's disease and retarded depression.

Insulin-like and fibroblast growth factors and their receptors are differentially
expressed in the oviducts of the common marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus)
during the ovulatory cycle.

Germany.

It is suggested that growth factors support the process of maturation and
differentiation in the mammalian oviduct. Fibroblast growth factors (FGF) and
insulin-like growth factors (IGF) are possible influences on these processes. The
present study describes for the first time the expression of FGF-1 and -2 and
their receptors as well as IGF-1 and -2 and the corresponding IGF receptor type 1
in the oviduct of the New World monkey Callithrix jacchus. Because of the limited
RNA yields from oviducts, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) was performed to estimate expression levels. Expression patterns were
found to be similar for all examined growth factors and receptors: the highest
mRNA contents were obtained at the late proliferative and early to midsecretory
phases, compared with lower levels during the early proliferative phase. Elevated
amounts of these RNAs were correlated with high serum estradiol but not with
progesterone concentrations. Each PCR product showed a high degree of homology (>
92%) to the known human sequences. Immunohistochemical analysis indicated greater
specific staining for FGF-1 and -2 and IGF-1 before ovulation on the luminal
epithelial surface of marmoset oviducts in comparison to the other cycle phases. 
Differences in staining intensity were not observed between the ampulla and
isthmus. In summary, the marmoset oviduct expresses all components of functional 
FGF and IGF systems, thus suggesting auto-/paracrine effects of these growth
factors within the primate oviduct, possibly under the control of estrogenic
hormones.

curves to gestational ages estimated retrospectively from delivery dates in 28
pregnancies from ten common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus). Both CRL- and
BPD-based estimates of gestational age were closely correlated with
delivery-based gestational age estimates. Of the three ultrasound machines used, 
the one with 16 shades of gray and a sequential linear array overestimated
gestational age during early pregnancy, based on CRL measures. Measures from the 
other two machines (64 or 264 shades of gray; linear sector and annular array or 
electronic phase array) were similar and resulted in a correlation of the two
estimates of gestational age of 0.94 and a mean difference between the two
estimates of 0.16 days with 80% of CRL-based gestational age estimates being
within +/- 5 days of the delivery-based estimate. The reliability of BPD-based
estimates of gestational age was strongly related to pregnancy outcome. BPD-based
estimates underestimated gestational age in poor outcome pregnancies (i.e., those
in which infants died within 7 days of birth) but not in good outcome
pregnancies. The combined CRL- and BPD-based estimates on poor outcome
pregnancies suggest that there was less growth in BPD in late gestation for those
pregnancies that resulted in nonviable offspring. For good outcome pregnancies,
the correlation between BPD-based and delivery-based estimates of gestational age
was 0.871 and the mean difference between the two estimates was -0.06 days with
83.3% of BPD-based estimates falling within +/- 5 days of delivery-based
estimates.

tokyo (Japan).

In the present study it was examined if the common marmoset was susceptible to
pravastatin (CAS 81131-70-6, CS 514, Mevalotin), an inhibitor of
3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase. It has been reported
that serum lipid levels in common marmosets resemble those in humans. First serum
total cholesterol and lipoprotein cholesterol levels of common marmosets were
examined in comparison with those in seven different experimental animals
including cynomolgus monkeys, beagle dogs, Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic
rabbits, Japanese White Rabbits, Sprague Dawley rats, Wistar-Imamichi rats and
golden hamsters. The animals were fed normal chow diets, and total- and
lipoprotein-cholesterol levels were determined under identical conditions. The
quantitative and polyacrylamide electrophoresis studies indicated that among
animals examined serum lipid and lipoprotein profiles in common marmosets were
similar to those in humans. When pravastatin at 1-30 mg/kg was orally
administered to common marmosets for 28 days, total, low density lipoprotein
(LDL)- and high density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels were decreased in a dose
dependent manner, whereas triglycerides and very low density lipoprotein
cholesterol did not change. These findings confirm that common marmosets have
serum lipid and lipoprotein profiles similar to those in humans suggesting that
they are susceptible to lipid lowering effects of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors.

transformation.

STP-C488 (STP of herpesvirus saimiri [HVS] group C strain 488 [C488]) is the only
virus-encoded protein found to associate with cellular ras and activate ras
signal transduction pathways. To investigate an important role for ras signal
transduction in STP-dependent growth transformation, we constructed recombinant
strains of HVS C488 in which the STP-C488 oncogene was replaced with cellular
normal ras (c-ras) or viral oncogenic ras (v-ras). Recombinant HVS deltaSTP/v-ras
immortalized primary common marmoset T lymphocytes to interleukin-2-independent
growth as efficiently as wild-type HVS C488 (wt HVS), while recombinant HVS
deltaSTP/c-ras did so with low efficiency. Whereas wt HVS immortalized CD4- CD8+ 
single-positive T lymphocytes, HVS deltaSTP/c-ras- and HVS
deltaSTP/v-ras-immortalized cells were principally CD4+ CD8+ double-positive T
lymphocytes. In addition, HVS deltaSTP/v-ras-immortalized T cells showed a high
level of ras expression and exhibited an adherent macrophage-like morphology.
These phenotypes were likely caused by the drastic activation of AP-1
transcriptional factor activity. Finally, HVS deltaSTP/v-ras and HVS
deltaSTP/c-ras each induced lymphoma in one of two common marmosets, although
onset of disease was more rapid with the v-ras virus. These results demonstrate
that ras can substitute for the STP oncogene of HVS C488 to allow immortalized
growth of primary lymphoid cells and that an activated form of ras does so more
efficiently than the normal cellular form of ras.

A single amino acid change in the hemagglutinin protein of measles virus
determines its ability to bind CD46 and reveals another receptor on marmoset B
cells.

This paper provides evidence for a measles virus receptor other than CD46 on
transformed marmoset and human B cells. We first showed that most tissues of
marmosets are missing the SCR1 domain of CD46, which is essential for the binding
of Edmonston measles virus, a laboratory strain that has been propagated in Vero 
monkey kidney cells. In spite of this deletion, the common marmoset was shown to 
be susceptible to infections by wild-type isolates of measles virus, although
they did not support Edmonston measles virus production. As one would expect from
these results, measles virus could not be propagated in owl monkey or marmoset
kidney cell lines, but surprisingly, both a wild-type isolate (Montefiore 89) and
the Edmonston laboratory strain of measles virus grew efficiently in B95-8
marmoset B cells. In addition, antibodies directed against CD46 had no effect on 
wild-type infections of marmoset B cells and only partially inhibited the
replication of the Edmonston laboratory strain in the same cells. A direct
binding assay with insect cells expressing the hemagglutinin (H) proteins of
either the Edmonston or Montefiore 89 measles virus strains was used to probe the
receptors on these B cells. Insect cells expressing Edmonston H but not the
wild-type H bound to rodent cells with CD46 on their surface. On the other hand, 
both the Montefiore 89 H and Edmonston H proteins adhered to marmoset and human B
cells. Most wild-type H proteins have asparagine residues at position 481 and can
be converted to a CD46-binding phenotype by replacement of the residue with
tyrosine. Similarly, the Edmonston H protein did not bind CD46 when its Tyr481
was converted to asparagine. However, this mutation did not affect the ability of
Edmonston H to bind marmoset and human B cells. The preceding results provide
evidence, through the use of a direct binding assay, that a second receptor for
measles virus is present on primate B cells.

Mutation of the Lck-binding motif of Tip enhances lymphoid cell activation by
herpesvirus saimiri.

The proline-rich SH3-binding (SH3B) motif of the tyrosine kinase-interacting
protein (Tip) of herpesvirus saimiri (HVS) is required for binding to the
cellular Src family kinase Lck. We constructed a mutant form of HVS in which
prolines in the SH3B motif of Tip were altered to alanines. This mutant form of
Tip was incapable of binding to Lck. The mutant virus, HVS/Tip mSH3B, retained
its ability to immortalize common marmoset lymphocytes in culture. In fact,
common marmoset lymphocytes immortalized by the HVS/Tip mSH3B mutant displayed
increased expression of HLA-DR lymphocyte activation marker, an altered pattern
of tyrosine phosphorylation, increased expression of the tyrosine kinase Lyn, and
a shift in electrophoretic mobility of Lck compared to cells immortalized by
wild-type HVS. Experimental infection of common marmosets resulted in fulminant
lymphoma with both HVS/Tip mSH3B and wild-type HVS. However, HVS/Tip mSH3B
produced greater infiltration of affected organs by proliferating lymphoid cells 
compared to wild-type HVS. These results demonstrate that Tip binding to Lck is
not necessary for transformation and that abrogation of Tip binding to Lck alters
the characteristics of transformed cells and the severity of the pathologic
lesions.

Concurrent monitoring of EEG and performance in the common marmoset: a
methodological approach.

A model has been developed in a nonhuman primate, the common marmoset (Callithrix
jacchus), which should enable the study of long term effects of compounds with
potentially psychoactive properties. The technique facilitates concurrent
monitoring of both behavioral and electrophysiological parameters while animals
remain in their home cages. Subjects were trained to perform tests from a
neuropsychological test battery (The Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated 
Battery, CANTAB) in which they learned to discriminate between pairs of stimuli
presented on a touch sensitive computer screen. Single channel cortical
electroencephalography (EEG) by radiotelemetry was simultaneously recorded while 
behavioral testing took place.

Mutant forms of herpesvirus saimiri (HVS) subgroup C strain 488 with deletions in
either STP-C488 or Tip were constructed. The transforming potentials of the HVS
mutants were tested in cell culture and in common marmosets. Parental HVS
subgroup C strain 488 immortalized common marmoset T lymphocytes in vitro to
interleukin-2-independent growth, but neither of the deletion mutants produced
such growth transformation. Wild-type HVS produced fatal lymphoma within 19 to 20
days of experimental infection of common marmosets, while HVS deltaSTP-C488 and
HVS deltaTip were nononcogenic. Virus was repeatedly isolated from the peripheral
blood of marmosets infected with mutant virus for more than 5 months. These
results demonstrate that STP-C488 and Tip are not required for replication or
persistence, but each is essential for transformation in cell culture and for
lymphoma induction in common marmosets.

Hand preference during behavioral tests and spontaneous activity in two species
of common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus and Callithrix penicillata).

Hand preference in two adult C. jacchus (one male and one female) and five C.
penicillata (three adult females and two 70-day-old male and female infants) was 
examined in this study. Animals were housed in large wire mesh cages and daily
tested twice during 40 consecutive days in 15-minute experimental sessions. Tests
were carried out with dog food pellets and were as follows: 1) food taking from a
glass cylinder (12 cm long x 5 cm diameter), 2) food taking from an opaque
plastic flask (11 cm long x 9.5 cm diameter) behind wire mesh, 3) food taking
under the cage floor and 4) spontaneous activity (food manipulation,
self-grooming and scratching behavior, and grasping wire mesh). It was observed
that 1) subjects exhibit a high manual ability in all testing conditions, 2) hand
biases occurred, but the subjects either reversed hand preference or the
preference was ambiguous as the performances are examined in a longitudinal
perspective, 3) hand biases were clearly more visible in test 1, which may be due
to the complexity of this task itself, 4) hand biases were not similar in all
testing conditions--i.e., subjects were left--in one test and right-handed in
another-, and 5) the main results were very similar in both C. jacchus and C.
penicillata and seem to be not dependent on either sex or age.

Ultrasonographic and hormonal monitoring of pregnancy in the saddle back tamarin,
Saguinus fuscicollis.

Kuederling I(1), Heistermann M.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Reproductive Biology, German Primate Centre, Göttingen, Germany.

Ultrasonography was used in six saddle back tamarin females (Saguinus
fuscicollis) to diagnose pregnancy, monitor the patterns of uterine growth and
embryonic/foetal development and examine the incidence loss of single
embryos/foetuses. Pregnancy was reliably diagnosed 17 days after conception, 10
days earlier than by plasma progesterone measurement. The patterns of uterine and
embryonic/foetal growth paralleled those reported for the common marmoset,
including a delay in embryonic development. The results support the hypothesis of
retardation of organogenesis in most callitrichid species. Individual embryos
could be reliably identified from day 50 of pregnancy; a loss of single
embryos/foetuses after this stage did not occur. All pregnancies were carried to 
term, resulting in five times twins and one singleton. The smaller litter size
compared to the common marmoset may be due to loss of single embryos at earlier
stages of pregnancy or to a lower ovulation rate.

Nonsurgical embryo transfer in the common marmoset monkey.

53715-1299, USA.

A technique for nonsurgical embryo transfer in common marmosets was developed.
Transfers were either synchronous (ST) or asynchronous (AT). Synchronous
transfers (embryo donor and the embryo recipient ovulated on the same day) were
performed 5 to 8 days post-ovulation. Asynchronous transfers (embryo donor had
ovulated at least 2 days before the embryo recipient) were performed when the
recipient was 2 to 4 days post-ovulation (donor was 6 to 8 days post-ovulation). 
Four pregnancies from nine transfers (44%) were established by AT, and three
pregnancies were carried to term. Only 1 of 11 transfers (9%) from ST resulted in
a pregnancy, which was lost by Day 40 of gestation. Significantly more infants
were born from AT (6 infants from 17 embryos; 35%) than from ST (0 infants from
22 embryos; 0%; p < 0.005). This technique allows experimental analysis of
primate postimplantation development and provides a tool for conservation of
endangered Callithrichid species.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) as a model for neuroleptic-induced acute
dystonia.

Fukuoka T(1), Nakano M, Kohda A, Okuno Y, Matsuo M.

Author information:

Japan.

To examine whether acute dystonia is induced by neuroleptic treatment, common
marmosets were treated with haloperidol orally twice a week over 25 weeks until
dystonic behavior was elicited. Movement disorders such as acute dystonia were
observed 6 weeks after the initial treatment, and had appeared in all treated
animals by 25 weeks. Once these movement disorders were induced, they
consistently reappeared after further treatment with haloperidol, and once
haloperidol dosing was discontinued, the episodes vanished. Then, various
neuroleptic drugs (bromperidol, chlorpromazine, risperidone thioridazine,
sulpiride, tiapride, and clozapine) or a nonneuroleptic drug (diazepam) were
administered orally instead of haloperidol in the above animals. All the
neuroleptic drugs except for clozapine elicited similar abnormal behavior, while 
diazepam failed to induce any dystonia. An anticholinergic drug, trihexyphenidyl,
which is known to reduce acute dystonia in patients, was also given orally to the
above haloperidol-sensitized animals, followed by further treatment with
haloperidol 30 min later. This clearly suppressed the induction of dystonia by
haloperidol. The similarity between these findings for haloperidol-pretreated
common marmosets and clinical findings suggests that the present model is useful 
for predicting the potential of antipsychotics to induce acute dystonia in
humans.

Primate embryonic stem cells.

53715-1299, USA.

Primate embryonic stem (ES) cells are derived from preimplantation embryos, have 
a normal karyotype, and are capable of indefinite, undifferentiated
proliferation. Even after culture for more than a year, primate ES cells maintain
the potential to differentiate to trophoblast and derivatives of embryonic
endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm. In this review, we compare the characteristics 
of ES cell lines from two primate species, the rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta) and
the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), with the characteristics of mouse ES
cells and human embryonal carcinoma cells. We also discuss the implications of
using primate ES cells to understand early human development and discuss the
practical and ethical implications for the understanding and treatment of human
disease.

Increased dopamine turnover in the putamen after MPTP treatment in common
marmosets.

Author information:

The differences in dopamine turnover rate between the putamen and the caudate
nucleus in the striatum lesioned by a neurotoxin
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) were studied in the common
marmoset, a small New World monkey. Systemic administration of MPTP damaged
equally and dose-dependently nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons projecting both
to the caudate nucleus and the putamen. The compensatory increase of dopamine
turnover, however, occurred more prominently in the putamen than in the caudate. 
The neural connection and function of the caudate nucleus and the putamen have
been differentiated anatomically or physiologically. The compensatory increase of
dopamine turnover rate is another different aspect of functions between the
caudate nucleus and the putamen. Dopaminergic neurons projecting to the putamen
showed more prominent cell loss than those projecting to the caudate in
Parkinson's disease or related disorders. The selective augmented turnover rate
of lesioned dopaminergic neurons might be, at least partly, involved with
selective degeneration of nigrostriatal neurons projecting to the putamen.

Four-week repeated inhalation study of HCFC 225ca and HCFC 225cb in the common
marmoset.

Four male and three female marmosets in each group were exposed to air only, 1000
ppm of HCFC 225ca or 5000 ppm of HCFC 225cb, for 6 h per day for 28 consecutive
days. HCFC 225ca caused a slight reduction in body weight. HCFC 225cb
occasionally caused somnolence during exposure and vomiting on the first day of
exposure. Clinical chemistry findings included a mild reduction of triglyceride, 
cholesterol and phospholipid levels and increased GOT level in the HCFC 225ca
exposure group. HCFC 225cb also caused a reduction of triglyceride levels in some
animals. HCFC 225ca caused a slight increase of hepatic carnitine
palmitoyltransferase (CPT) activity while HCFC 225cb slightly increased
cyanide-insensitive palmitoyl CoA beta-oxidation (FAOS) activity. In the HCFC
225cb exposure group, an increase in cytochrome P-450 content was also observed. 
HCFC 225ca caused a fatty change in the hepatic cells. Increased incidence of
lipid droplets in the hepatic cells and myelin-like bodies in hepatic cells,
Kupffer's cells and hepatic blood vessels were observed electron microscopically 
in the HCFC 225ca exposure group. A proliferation of smooth endoplasmic reticulum
was observed in the HCFC 225cb exposure group. Decreased peroxisome volume
density in the HCFC 225ca group, and increased volume density in the HCFC 225cb
exposed females were seen. However, organ weight measurement and
histopathological examination did not reveal hepatomegaly or hypertrophy with
either substance. Although slight changes were noticed in peroxisome volume
density and in some of the peroxisomal enzyme activities, the changes related to 
peroxisome proliferation with HCFC 225ca and 225cb were minimal in marmosets
compared to those seen in rats. Histopathological examination and hormonal
analysis did not reveal any abnormalities in the pancreas or testes.

Receptive field dimensions of lateral geniculate cells in the common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus).

We measured the spatial receptive field dimensions of cells in the lateral
geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) using a
bipartite field stimulus in which the two halves of the field were modulated
identically but in counterphase. Horizontal and vertical edges between the two
fields were positioned at different locations in the receptive field. By assuming
that centers and surrounds have gaussian profiles, we were able to obtain a
satisfactory mathematical description of the data. Receptive field centers were
about a factor 1.6 larger than those of macaque LGN cells, in accordance with the
smaller marmoset eye. There was a limited correspondence with dendritic tree
dimensions of marmoset retinal ganglion cells. We further found that center and
surround gaussians were not always concentric, and that the centers of some cells
were elongated. This might allow some direction or orientation biases in LGN
cells.

Effects of click intensity and frequency on the brain-stem auditory evoked
potentials in the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).

Harada T(1), Tokuriki M.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Veterinary Physiology, Faculty of Agriculture, Yamaguchi
University, Japan.

Brain-stem auditory evoked potentials (BAEPs) were recorded in 20 common
marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) to investigate the effects of click frequency up
to 99 kHz, in consideration of the higher hearing range of the marmoset, and
intensity on wave forms and peak latencies. According to the results of BAEP
recordings at frequencies of 4, 32, and 99 kHz, the number of components recorded
was affected by the stimulus intensity and the clicks at an intensity of 80 dB
peak equivalent sound pressure level (pe SPL) had the maximum number of clear
components. Therefore, it was indicated that click stimulations at an intensity
of 80 dB pe SPL over a broad range of frequencies appears to be useful for
recording the maximum number of components in marmosets and may increase the
information obtainable from BAEPs. BAEP latencies were prolonged as the stimulus 
intensity decreased from 100 to 50 dB pe SPL. The effects of stimulus frequency
on the wave latencies and amplitudes in response to 80 dB pe SPL at frequencies
between 0.5 and 99 kHz revealed various changes: the amplitude of wave I
increased at 16 and 32 kHz, but that of waves III and V increased at 4-8 and
64-99 kHz. These increases in amplitudes of the waves may correlate with higher
synchronous activity of the peripheral or central auditory pathways.

Evidence that blue-on cells are part of the third geniculocortical pathway in
primates.

(1)Department of Physiology and Institute for Biomedical Research, University of 
Sydney, NSW, Australia.

Colour vision in primates is mediated by cone opponent ganglion cells in the
retina, whose axons project to the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus in the
visual thalamus. It has long been assumed that cone opponent ganglion cells
project to the parvocellular layers of the geniculate. Here, we examine the role 
of a third subdivision of the geniculocortical pathway: the interlaminar or
koniocellular geniculate relay cells. We made extracellular recordings in the
dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus of the common marmoset Callithrix jacchus, a
New World monkey in which the interlaminar cells are well segregated from the
parvocellular layers. We found that one group of colour opponent cells, the
blue-on cells, was largely segregated to the interlaminar zone. This segregation 
was common to dichromatic ('red-green colour-blind') and trichromatic marmosets. 
The result calls into question the traditional notion that all colour information
passes through the parvocellular division of the retino-geniculo-cortical pathway
in primates.

Nitric oxide synthase inhibition and MPTP-induced toxicity in the common
marmoset.

(1)Neurodegenerative Diseases Research Centre, King's College London, United
Kingdom.

Nitric oxide, produced following activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)
receptors, may be involved in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)
toxicity since NMDA receptor antagonists have been shown to prevent MPTP induced 
nigral cell loss in primates. Common marmosets were treated with either saline or
MPTP or L-NGnitro arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) or MPTP and L-NAME. MPTP-treated
common marmosets showed motor deficits including bradykinesia, rigidity, and
tremor accompanied by a marked loss of tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive
neurones in the substantia nigra pars compacta and of [3H]-mazindol binding in
the caudate-putamen. MPTP treatment also caused an increase in glial fibrillary
acidic protein (GFAP) staining in the substantia nigra compared to controls.
However, MPTP treatment did not alter the number of constitutive nitric oxide
synthase-immunoreactive neurones in the caudate-putamen. Furthermore, neurones or
glial cells immunoreactive for inducible nitric oxide synthase were not observed 
in the substantia nigra pars compacta following MPTP treatment. L-NAME treatment 
alone did not produce any behavioural changes in marmosets and did not alter the 
number of tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive cells in the substantia nigra pars 
compacta, the number of constitutive nitric oxide synthase-immunoreactive
neurones or [3H]-mazindol binding in the caudate-putamen compared to
saline-treated control animals. Furthermore, L-NAME did not affect the motor
deficits, loss of tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive neurones in the substantia 
nigra pars compacta, loss of [3H]-mazindol binding in the caudate-putamen, or the
increase in GFAP staining in the substantia nigra induced by MPTP treatment of
common marmosets. The failure of L-NAME to protect against MPTP-induced toxicity 
in the marmoset suggests that nitric oxide does not play a major role in such
toxicity and casts doubt over the involvement of the NMDA:nitric oxide system in 
neurodegeneration in MPTP-treated primates.

Role of androgens in follicle maturation and atresia.

Hillier SG(1), Tetsuka M.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University of Edinburgh, UK.

Androgens are products of progestogen metabolism, intermediates in oestrogen
biosynthesis and local regulators of ovarian function. Current understanding of
intraovarian androgen formation, metabolism and action is reviewed, highlighting 
the contribution of androgens to the paracrine regulation of follicular
maturation and atresia. Any factor that alters intracellular cAMP levels is a
potential modulator of granulosa cell differentiation, and hence follicular
development. Androgen appears to modulate gonadotrophin action on granulosa cells
through amplification of cAMP-mediated post-receptor signalling. Here it is
argued that during intermediate stages of follicular development, locally
produced androgen acts via granulosa cell androgen receptors (AR) to promote
follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)-induced granulosa cell differentiation through
amplifying cAMP-mediated post-receptor signalling. During late pre-ovulatory
follicular development, higher concentrations of cAMP caused by stimulation with 
luteinizing hormone (LH) suppress granulosa cell proliferation and down-regulate 
some of the genes induced by FSH at earlier stages of pre-ovulatory development, 
including aromatase activity. Other granulosa cell functions, including
progesterone synthesis, are enhanced by the high concentrations of cAMP induced
by LH. There is experimental evidence from studies of rat and non-human primate
(common marmoset) ovaries that AR levels in granulosa cells decline during
pre-ovulatory follicular maturation. Since androgens augment FSH-induced cAMP
formation and action, loss of AR could be a means of avoiding inappropriately
high cAMP levels and hence avoiding premature activation of 'high-tone'
cAMP-response genes that lead to atresia. Negative regulation of the granulosa
cell AR could be part of the intra-ovarian mechanism that determines which
follicle(s) becomes dominant and secretes oestrogen in the normal menstrual
cycle.

Reproductive efficiency in the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus): a
longitudinal study from ovulation to birth monitored by ultrasonography.

Nubbemeyer R(1), Heistermann M, Oerke AK, Hodges JK.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Reproductive Biology, German Primate Center, Göttingen, Germany.

This study examines reproductive efficiency in the common marmoset monkey,
Callithrix jacchus, using sequential ultrasound examinations to establish
ovulation number, implantation rate, and incidence of prenatal loss. Ultrasound
was carried out with a 10 or 7.5 mHz probe in nonsedated animals, daily during
the late follicular phase, approximately twice a week until day 20 after
ovulation, and at days 35, 56, and 85 of pregnancy to enable visualization of
gestation sacs, heartbeats, and fetal heads, respectively. Ovulatory follicles
could be seen 3-4 days before ovulation and by day -2, 98% of ovulating follicles
were > 2mm diameter, although almost 10% of follicles of this size disappeared
without ovulating. Total number of ovulating follicles for 15 females was 45
(mean ovulation rate = 3.0, range 2-4). In the 14 animals that conceived, 41
corpora lutea were identified (mean ovulation rate = 2.9) within 10 days of
ovulation. All pregnancies went to term (no abortion occurred) resulting in the
birth of 37 neonates (9 triplets, 5 twins) and an average litter size of 2.64.
All four losses were confined to the embryonic period (< day 85), two occurring
before day 35, one between days 35 and 56, and one between days 56 and 85. In
demonstrating that 90% of ovulatory follicles gave rise to live offspring, the
results of this study indicate an extremely high reproductive efficiency in the
marmoset monkey (when maintained under favorable captive conditions) and a rate
of prenatal loss much lower than that reported for other primate species.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection in animal model systems has been studied
previously in marmosets and tamarins using serology and PCR of saliva. Here we
directly demonstrated long-term persistence of EBV in the peripheral blood of
marmosets by assaying EBER RNA expression. A new reverse transcription-PCR assay,
able to distinguish a naturally occurring strain polymorphism in EBER 2 that may 
be useful as a strain marker for monitoring persistence and interactions between 
multiple strains in the same animal or person, has been developed. In situ
hybridization and immunohistochemistry have also been used to search for
EBV-infected cells in the animals. The carrier state in the common marmoset is
similar to that of humans in that it is asymptomatic, long-lived and displays a
very low level of circulating virus-infected cells. It differs from the human in 
lacking the characteristic antibody response to EBNA 1.

Functional characterization and purification of an intracellular vitamin
D-binding protein in vitamin D-resistant new world primate cells. Amino acid
sequence homology with proteins in the hsp-70 family.

Angeles, California 90048, USA.

Most genera of New World primates exhibit resistance to vitamin D. These monkeys 
harbor high circulating concentrations of the prohormone 25-hydroxyvitamin D and 
the active vitamin D hormone 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D. Previous work from this
laboratory indicated that resistance is associated with the overexpression of a
60-65-kDa intracellular protein that binds vitamin D metabolites competitively.
In the current studies 25-[3H]hydroxyvitamin D3 (25-OHD3) was used as a
competitive ligand to investigate the ability of a number of small lipid
molecules to interact with this intracellular vitamin D-binding protein (IDBP) in
post-nuclear extracts of a prototypical lymphoblast cell line from the common
marmoset, a vitamin D-resistant New World primate. Only those vitamin D
metabolites with a hydroxyl moiety in the C-25 position were bound by IDBP.
Disruption of the C-25 hydroxyl obviated binding, whereas more proximal
alterations in the vitamin D side chain did not. Modifications in the A-ring of
25-hydroxylated vitamin D metabolites, most specifically hydroxylation of C-1,
diminished but did not abolish ligand binding. Of more than two dozen other small
lipid molecules examined, only the C-19 17-hydroxysteroids, 17beta-estradiol and 
testosterone, and the C-21 steroid progesterone were found to be capable of
binding specifically to IDBP. Using a combination of physical and serial
chromatographic techniques, we enriched IDBP 25-OHD3 binding activity 17,588-fold
in extracts of B95-8 cells. Two-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis of this purified fraction demonstrated a predominant 65-kDa
molecular species with a pI approximately 4.5. Seven different peptide fragments 
were isolated from the 65-kDa protein, each possessing sequence similarity to the
hsp-70 family of proteins. Ligand binding analyses confirmed that human inducibly
expressed hsp-70-bound 25-OHD3 with approximately similar affinity (
approximately 10(-7) M) as did purified IDBP. In summary, these results suggest a
novel action for the hsp-70 family of proteins as intracellular vitamin D- and
gonadal steroid hormone-binding molecules.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory disease of the CNS white matter
characterized pathologically by the accumulation of perivascular and parenchymal 
T lymphocytes (T cells), and macrophage infiltration associated with myelin
destruction. MS lesions are also characterized by the death of oligodendrocytes
(the myelin-producing cells) and proliferation and hypertrophy of astrocytes with
scar tissue (gliosis) replacing normal myelin. These changes result in the loss
of axonal conduction for neurons of the CNS and in clinical disability. MS is
thought to be an autoimmune disease, in particular because of its analogy with
the disease model of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE). Despite
extensive research and the availability of various EAE models in laboratory
rodents the etiology of human MS has not been identified, and to date no
effective treatment exists. Phylogenetic differences may limit the usefulness of 
existing EAE models, and indeed no single form of rodent EAE recapitulates all
the clinical and pathological features of MS. Here we describe a novel form of
EAE created in a nonhuman primate, the common marmoset Callithrix jacchus. Active
immunization of these monkeys with whole myelin produces a primary demyelinating 
disease with a chronic relapsing-remitting course, characterized pathologically
by moderate inflammation with prominent and early demyelination and gliosis
reminiscent of human MS. Adoptive and passive transfer experiments have permitted
definition of the mechanisms responsible for the MS-like pathology. Production of
the fully demyelinated lesion requires synergism between encephalitogenic (e.g., 
disease-inducing) T cells and pathogenic antibody. The antigens of myelin that
promote encephalitogenic T cell and antibody responses in this system have been
identified. Because of the similarity between the two conditions and the high
degree of conservation in immune and nervous system genes between nonhuman
primates and humans, future studies of marmoset EAE will likely accelerate the
development of therapies for human MS.

Diagnosis and Treatment of Trichospirura leptostoma Infection in Common Marmosets
(Callithrix jacchus).

Trichospirura leptostoma is a spirurid nematode that inhabits the pancreatic
ducts of the common marmoset, Callithrix jacchus, and other New World primates.
This parasite was diagnosed in members of this species at the Marmoset Research
Center in Oak Ridge, Tennessee colony after their importation from multiple
colonies outside the United States. Animals with few parasites in the pancreas
had few tissue changes, whereas those with many parasites had moderate to severe 
fibrosis replacing exocrine tissue. Trichospirura leptostoma can cause chronic
pancreatitis, resulting in subclinical to clinical pancreatic insufficiency and
secondary malnutrition. Clinical signs of pancreatic insufficiency in affected
marmosets included weight loss (despite good appetite) and increased fecal
volume. Because earlier reports did not mention treatments, experimental
therapeutic regimens were attempted to eliminate infections from the marmosets.
In the clinical studies, different doses and treatment periods with ivermectin
and fenbendazole were evaluated for therapeutic efficacy. Fenbendazole given
daily at a dosage of 50 mg/kg of body weight by gavage for 14 days was the most
effective treatment (PI 0.052). Control of the cockroach vector, as well as
treatment of infected animals, is needed to prevent Trichospirura
leptostoma-induced disease.

Number of ovulations in the marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus): relation to
body weight, age and repeatability.

The relation between number of ovulations and body weight, age or maternal
identity was examined in 69 ovarian cycles from 29 captive-born common marmoset
monkeys (Callithrix jacchus). Specifically, we addressed the following questions:
was there high repeatability of ovulation number? Most of the variation in
ovulation number was within, rather than between subjects. Repeatability in
number of ovulations was 0.081 (n = 20 females with 2-6 ovulatory cycles per
female); was age related to number of ovulations? There was no relation between
age and number of ovulations, either within or between subjects; and was weight
related to number of ovulations? Weight was related to number of ovulations. When
the relation between number of ovulations (1-2 versus 3-4) and weight was
examined through a logistic regression, there was a significant relation. Also,
of the 11 subjects which had a variable number of ovulations across cycles, 90.9%
were heavier when ovulating 3-4 than when ovulating 2. These results are
discussed as the basis for the proposal that callitrichid primates may have been 
selected for potential variation in reproductive output and that this variation
may be related to energy availability.

Calbindin immunoreactivity delineates the circadian visual centers of the brain
of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).

Costa MS(1), Britto LR.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Morphology, Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, Natal,

The hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus and the thalamic pregeniculate nucleus
(which includes the intergeniculate leaflet) comprise the circadian visual system
in the primate brain. In this study, we used intraocular injections of cholera
toxin subunit B to identify those nuclei in the common marmoset brain, and
demonstrated that calbindin D-28k immunoreactivity apparently labels most neurons
in both the suprachiasmatic and pregeniculate nuclei. These data suggest that
calbindin D-28k could represent a reliable neuronal marker for structures of the 
circadian visual system in marmosets and provide anatomical information on the
primate equivalent of the rodent intergeniculate leaflet.

The distribution of p75 neurotrophin receptor-immunoreactive cells in the
forebrain of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).

Cambridge, UK.

The distribution of neurones that could be stained immunohistochemically with
antibody to the p75 neurotrophin protein was studied in the forebrain of the
common marmoset. The p75-immunoreactive forebrain cells appear to correspond to
choline acetyltransferase-immunoreactive (i.e., cholinergic) neurones. Two
populations of cells could be distinguished on the basis of the intensity of p75 
immunostaining. Moderately stained cells correspond to cholinergic interneurones 
of the caudate and putamen, while intensely stained cells correspond to the
cholinergic neurones projecting to the cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus, located
in the septum, diagonal band, and basal nucleus of Meynert. The distribution of
cells of the diagonal band/basal nucleus complex is more extensive in the
marmoset than in other primate species, extending into parts of the
postcommissural fornix via the posterior septum, and by small projections dorsal 
to the anterior commissure and via the thalamic fasciculus from the basal
nucleus; the posterior extent of the basal nucleus continues extensively into the
lamina between the globus pallidus and the putamen.

Brain-stem auditory evoked potentials in the common marmoset (Callithrix
jacchus).

Harada T(1), Tokuriki M.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Veterinary Physiology, Faculty of Agriculture, Yamaguchi
University, Japan.

Brain-stem auditory evoked potentials (BAEPs) were recorded in 10 common
marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) to investigate the effects of recording electrode 
configurations, stimulus rate, and stimulus frequency on BAEP wave forms and peak
latencies. Tone burst stimulations were used to evaluate the effects of pure tone
on BAEP wave forms. Five positive peaks superimposed on positive and negative
slow potentials were identified in the BAEP recorded at the linkage between the
vertex and the dorsal base of the ear ipsilateral to a monaural stimulus. When
the reference electrode was placed at the ipsilateral mastoid or the neck, the
amplitudes of positive and negative slow potentials and the incidence of wave I
increased. There were no significant changes in peak latencies of BAEP waves with
changes in stimulus rate from 5 to 20/s. It was possible to record the BAEPs in
response to tone burst stimulations at frequencies extending from 0.5 to 99 kHz. 
Wave I appeared apparently at high stimulus frequencies; while waves III to V, at
low frequencies. Wave II was recorded at frequencies ranging from 0.5 to 99 kHz
and comprised a superposition of 2 or 3 potentials.

Birth of offspring following artificial insemination in the common marmoset,
Callithrix jacchus.

Author information: 
(1)Deutsches Primatenzentrum, Göttingen, Germany.

The objective of the study was to develop a method for artificial insemination
(AI) in the common marmoset, a New World primate species. For AI to be
successful, sperm must be deposited at an appropriate site and time in the female
reproductive tract, details of which are currently not available for Callitrichid
species. Epididymal sperm were deposited in the cervix of 18 marmoset monkeys
(Callithrix jacchus) around the time of expected ovulation using either 3, 2, or 
1 inseminations. Six out of 18 females conceived, resulting in the first reported
births following AI in this species. These pregnancies show that the presence of 
coagulum in the vagina and the stimulus of the female reproductive tract by
natural mating are not essential for effective sperm transport in this species.
Although 3 different timing regimes for sperm deposition relative to ovulation
were employed, no protocol was demonstrably better than the others in terms of
number of conceptions. The proportions of motile, live, and morphologically
normal sperm in the suspensions used for AI were comparable with published values
for ejaculates from fertile male macaques. These preliminary results indicate
that births are possible following AI in marmosets: the technique could be used
to aid effective genetic management of the species and possibly to facilitate
captive breeding of endangered Callitrichids.

Development of an enzyme-immunoassay (EIA) for the measurement of

Despite the importance of Callitrichid primates in both biomedical and
conservation research, practical and reliable immunoassays for the measurement of
follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) have not yet been described. A panel of
monoclonal antibodies against specific peptide fragments within either the alpha 
or beta subunit of human FSH was evaluated for their ability to recognize FSH
from Callitrichid and other New World primates. One of these, monoclonal antibody
46.3h6.b7 raised against human FSH, was selected due to its ability to recognize 
marmoset monkey FSH and its low crossreactivity with other gonadotrophins. The
antibody formed the basis of an enzymeimmunoassay using a highly purified human
urinary FSH (Metrodin, Serono) preparation coupled to biotin as label and
unmodified as standard. After 24 h incubation, antibody bound label was
visualized by addition of streptavidin-peroxidase followed by the appropriate
substrate. Parallelism was obtained between the standard and dilutions of
pituitary extracts, urine and plasma from the common marmoset (Callithrix
jacchus) as well as from two tamarin species (Saguinus fuscicollis and S.
oedipus) and one squirrel monkey (Saimiri sciureus). Profiles of plasma and
urinary FSH during the follicular phase are shown for two individual marmosets.
The ability to measure FSH in Callitrichidae provides new opportunities for
studies of the reproductive biology of these New World primate species.

Familial influences on ovulatory function in common marmosets (Callithrix
jacchus).

Saltzman W(1), Schultz-Darken NJ, Abbott DH.

Author information: 
(1)Wisconsin Regional Primate Research Center, University of Wisconsin, Madison
53715-1299, USA.

Previous studies have indicated that many, but not all, female common marmosets
(Callithrix jacchus) housed with their natal families undergo social suppression 
of ovulation. In this study, we further characterized ovulatory activity in
common marmoset daughters to determine the prevalence of social suppression of
ovulation and to elucidate familial influences on daughters' ovarian activity.
Blood samples were collected twice weekly from each of 46 daughters for 5-12
months, usually beginning when the daughters were 12 months of age. Plasma
progesterone concentrations indicated that 46.3% of daughters in intact natal
families ovulated at least once, with the age at first ovulation averaging 17.2
months; however, none of these daughters became pregnant. Daughters' ovulatory
cycles showed several significant differences from those of older females housed 
with unrelated adults, including longer periods between successive luteal phases,
shorter luteal phases, and lower peak and mean luteal-phase progesterone levels. 
Daughters were significantly more likely to ovulate in families in which the
mother was experimentally prevented from sustaining pregnancies, and in families 
in which the father had been replaced by an unrelated adult male and when the
daughter was approximately 10-11 months of age. Daughters in families containing 
an older sister never ovulated; in contrast, those with a female littermate were 
not less likely to ovulate than were other daughters, but had more sporadic
ovarian cycles and significantly lower mean luteal-phase progesterone levels.
These results confirm and extend previous findings that up to half of female
common marmosets may ovulate while housed with the natal family but that
virtually none sustain pregnancies, suggesting that suppression of ovulation is
only one of several components of reproductive failure. Furthermore, these
results demonstrate that daughters' likelihood of ovulating, as well as the
endocrine profiles of their ovulatory cycles, can be modulated by numerous social
influences within the family.

Location and developmental regulation of androgen receptor in primate ovary.

Hillier SG(1), Tetsuka M, Fraser HM.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University of Edinburgh Centre for
Reproductive Biology, UK.

Locally produced androgens act via granulosa cell androgen receptors to modulate 
follicular responsiveness to gonadotrophins and thereby contribute to the
paracrine regulation of ovarian function. We used quantitative androgen receptor 
immunocytochemistry to assess androgen receptor distribution in relation to
pre-ovulatory follicular development in the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus),
a New World primate that ovulates two to four follicles in each approximately 28 
day ovarian cycle. Ovaries from four adult females in the late follicular phase
and from four in the luteal phase were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and subjected
to an immunocytochemical analysis using a polyclonal androgen receptor antibody
with detection by a standard avidin-biotin-peroxidase technique for alkaline
phosphatase. Specific androgen receptor immunostaining occurred mainly in
granulosa cell nuclei, with little or no specific staining in theca, stroma or
oocytes. Granulosa cell androgen receptor immunostaining was most abundant in
healthy preantral/early antral follicles, being low or absent from pre-ovulatory 
follicles and corpora lutea. Differences in granulosa cell androgen receptor
immunostaining between immature (0.1-1.0 mm diameter) and pre-ovulatory (> or =
2.0 mm diameter) follicles were quantified using a videodensitometric analysis of
grey-scale values. Readings were taken from the granulosa cell layers of 53
immature follicles and 10 pre-ovulatory follicles in late follicular phase
ovaries. The average androgen receptor level in granulosa cells of immature
follicles proved to be 4.2-fold higher (P < 0.01) than that in granulosa cells of
pre-ovulatory follicles. Because other evidence suggests that paracrine androgen 
action in granulosa cells converts from stimulation to inhibition as follicles
mature, we speculate that a development-related reduction in androgen receptor
numbers serves to "protect' granulosa cells against the inhibitory action of
androgen, thereby promoting pre-ovulatory follicular dominance in primate ovarian
cycles.

Cardiac-like musculature of the intrapulmonary venous wall of the long-clawed
shrew (Sorex unguiculatus), common tree shrew (Tupaia glis) and common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus).

BACKGROUND: The cardiac-like musculature is distributed not only in the heart
wall but also in the intrapulmonary venous wall in a few species of insectivores.
It has been suggested that the evolutionary origin of venous cardiac-like
musculature may be traceable to a basic stock of certain mammalian lines of
descent. So, it is important to clarify whether the musculature may be a common
structure in lower mammals from insectivores to primates and to examine the
functional significance of the structure.
METHODS: The distribution of cardiac-like musculature in the intrapulmonary
venous wall of the long-clawed shrew (Sorex unguiculatus), common tree shrew
(Tupaia glis), and common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) was observed by light and
electron microscopy. The presence of atrial natriuretic polypeptide (ANP) was
examined in the musculature by immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: All three species contained cardiac-like myocytes in the tunica media of
intrapulmonary venous wall. In the common tree shrew and the common marmoset,
cardiac-like musculature was found in the small intrapulmonary vein of 150-200
microns in diameter, while, in the long-clawed shrew, it was distributed even in 
the intrapulmonary vein of 30 microns in diameter. Ultrastructure of myocytes was
fundamentally similar to that of atrial myocytes in the long-clawed shrew and the
common tree shrew. The presence of atrial natriuretic polypeptide (ANP) was also 
demonstrated by immunohistochemistry in the intrapulmonary venous walls of common
tree shrews.
CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that the pulmonary venous cardiac-like
musculature occurs in the lower eutherian mammals from insectivores to primitive 
primates. The musculature is thought to act as a regulatory pump in pulmonary
circulation and as an endocrine apparatus of ANP.

Tumors of the respiratory tract observed at the German Primate Center, 1978-1994.

Eight spontaneous pulmonary tumors (four bronchiolar tubular adenomas, two
bronchiolar adenocarcinomas, two squamous-cell carcinomas) occurred in a total of
54 adult tree shrews (Tupaia belangeri) of the GPC colonies between 1978 and
1994. The adenomas and adenocarcinomas consisted of tubularly or trabecularly
arranged cuboidal to cylindrical cells interspersed with some PAS-positive goblet
cells, thus resembling the epithelial lining of respiratory bronchioles of tree
shrews. The two squamous-cell carcinomas probably originated from the pulmonary
alveoles. Three more pulmonary tumors (one small-cell carcinoma, one bronchial
adenoma, one squamous-cell carcinoma) developed in 409 adult callitrichids of the
GPC colonies during the same period, and one more bronchial adenoma was observed 
in a common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) of another colony located in Göttingen.
With regard to the adenomas and squamous-cell carcinomas, a similar cellular
origin with the three shrews is assumed. The small-cell carcinoma possibly
developed from the bronchial epithelium, provided a pathogenesis parallel to that
of human small-cell carcinoma is suggested. Four of the tree shrew pulmonary
adenomas/adenocarcinomas and the small-cell Ca were macroscopically visible as
yellowish-grey nodules of 1 mm x 1 mm to 15 mm x 15 mm diameter, predominantly
involving the main lobes (2 x right main lobes, 2 x left main lobes, 1 x all
lobes). The pulmonary tumors of the other animals were below macroscopical
detectability.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is the cause of infectious mononucleosis and is
associated with a variety of life-threatening diseases in humans. Therefore the
development of an effective vaccine is an important objective. Many of the
initial studies of vaccine efficacy analyse the ability of vaccine preparations
to prevent the induction of lymphomas in cottontop tamarins by the B95-8 strain
of EBV. We used a vaccinia virus recombinant expressing gp340, vMA1, tested
previously in the cotton-top tamarin, to evaluate a common marmoset model in
which the challenge virus, M81, resembles more closely the wild-type strains of
EBV in the general population than does the standard B95-8 strain. We
characterised the M81 strain of EBV with respect to the sequence of its gp340/220
gene and in regard to the presence of a region deleted in B95-8. Replication of
the challenge virus in the group vaccinated with vMA1 was decreased when compared
to control groups.

The effects of cage size and complexity on the behaviour of captive common
marmosets, Callithrix jacchus jacchus.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Zoology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria,
Australia.

Conditions of captivity of primates used in biomedical research may have
deleterious effects on the welfare of the animals and consequently on the
reliability of the research. We investigated the effects of cage size and cage
complexity, two fundamental characteristics of captive conditions, on the
behaviour of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus jacchus). We found an
increase in the general level of activity and significant variation in the
frequencies of specific behaviours with an increase in cage size and also with
cage complexity. Stereotyped behaviours, which occurred in the small cages, were 
never exhibited in the large cages. The effect of the novelty of the changed
conditions was also assessed and found to be significant for some behaviours. We 
also measured the time taken to capture an animal, a task frequently performed by
the animal technician, under the various cage conditions. Capture time increased 
significantly in the larger cages, but the overall effect of the changes to the
marmosets' housing conditions on the animal technician's work was not regarded as
substantial. We conclude that the welfare of captive marmosets is enhanced by the
provision of larger and more complex cages, and that such cages do not
significantly affect the efficiency of the research laboratory.

interleukin-4 receptors.

The distribution of the interleukin (IL)-4 receptor in normal human and common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) tissues was examined by immunofluorescence and flow
cytometry using monoclonal antibodies specific for the human IL-4 receptor to
gain further insight into IL-4-mediated inflammatory and immunological events.
IL-4 receptor positivity was unequivocally demonstrated on lymphocytes,
predominantly T cells, and on blood vessels in many tissues. Vascular IL-4
receptor immunofluorescence consisted of a strong smooth muscle cell positivity
and weaker positive staining of capillary and venular endothelial cells.
Subnanomolar concentrations of IL-4 induced a genistein-sensitive up-regulation
of VCAM-1 in vascular cell cultures. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha induced a
genistein-resistant up-regulation of VCAM-1. IL-4 strongly induced expression of 
the IL-4 receptor on splenocytes (T lymphocytes) but not on vascular smooth
muscle or endothelial cell cultures. Receptor cross-linking to [125I]IL-4
revealed a 65- to 75-kDa accessory receptor subunit consistent with a recently
cloned IL-13 receptor associated with the IL-4 receptor on both vascular
endothelial and smooth muscle cells. The demonstration of a vascular distribution
pattern for the IL-4 receptor in addition to expression on lymphocytes suggests
that vascular functional alterations, transduced through a unique IL-4 receptor
complex (the type II IL-4 receptor), may be of importance during immunological
and allergic inflammatory events.

The biobehavioral consequences of psychogenic stress in a small, social primate
(Callithrix jacchus jacchus).

Author information:

Human Development, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.

The biobehavioral consequences of psychogenic stress were examined using
neuroendocrine and ethological methods in a captive colony of common marmosets
(Callithrix jacchus jacchus). Specifically, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) 
axis reactivity was evaluated as a function of gender and social status in four
consecutive social environments [(1) stable heterosexual pairs; (2) isolation;
(3) unstable peer groups; and (4) stable peer groups], by measuring both basal
plasma cortisol, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and beta-endorphin
concentrations and responsiveness of these hormones to dexamethasone, ovine
corticotropin-releasing hormone (oCRH), and ACTH1-24. Socially stressful
conditions, such as isolation and peer group formation, were associated with
increased HPA axis function and behavioral arousal, and individual profiles were 
related to gender and social status. Hormonal levels prior to group formation
predicted subsequent status in peer groups. Basal morning concentrations of
plasma cortisol, as well as cortisol responsiveness to dexamethasone suppression,
were sensitive indices of HPA axis arousal during periods of social stress. The
context-dependent development of hormonal and behavioral profiles, reminiscent of
depression and/or anorexia nervosa, suggests that the common marmoset may be a
useful model of psychiatric hypercortisolism.

Expression of protamine P2 in the testis of the common marmoset and man
visualized using non-radioactive in-situ hybridization.

(1)MRC Reproductive Biology Unit, Edinburgh, UK.

Information on the organization of the spermatogenic cycle of the common marmoset
(Callíthrix jacchus), a small New World primate, is limited to a single
histological report on the differentiation of spermatids. In the present study we
have used non-radioactive in-situ hybridization with a cRNA probe directed
against marmoset protamine 2, on fixed sections of marmoset and human testis to
elucidate the organization of mature germ cells within the seminiferous
epithelium. Specificity of the probe was checked on Northern blots; mP2
hybridized exclusively to mRNA in samples extracted from marmoset and human
testis. In sections from human and marmoset testis, positive staining for mRNA
was confined to round and elongating spermatids and in the human was reduced in
samples from patients with incomplete spermatogenesis. In the human, P2 mRNA was 
present in groups of cells consistent with the presence of more than one stage of
the spermatogenic cycle in transverse sections of individual tubules. In the
marmoset, P2-positive cells were detected as a continuous ring of staining in the
majority of sections of tubules whilst in others only a group(s) of cells was
positive. We conclude that the arrangement of the spermatogenic wave in this New 
World primate may be intermediate between that seen in rodents (segmental) and in
the human (helical).

Pluripotent cell lines derived from common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus)
blastocysts.

53715-1299, USA.

We report the derivation of eight pluripotent cell lines from common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus) blastocysts. These cell lines are positive for a series of
markers (alkaline phosphatase, SSEA-3, SSEA-4, TRA-1-60, and TRA-1-81) that
characterize undifferentiated human embryonal carcinoma cells and rhesus
embryonic stem cells. All eight cell lines had a modal chromosome number of 46;
seven cell lines were XX and one was XY. Two cell lines (Cj11 and Cj62) were
cultured continuously for over a year and remained undifferentiated and euploid. 
In the absence of fibroblast feeder layers, these cell lines differentiated to
multiple cell types, even in the presence of leukemia inhibiting factor.
Differentiated cells secreted bioactive CG into the culture medium and expressed 
alpha-CG, beta-CG, and alpha-fetoprotein mRNA, indicating trophoblast and
endoderm differentiation. Bioactive CG secretion in differentiating cells was
increased substantially in the presence of GnRH agonist D-Trp6-Pro9-NHEt. When
grown at high densities, these cells formed embryoid bodies with a close
resemblance to early postimplantation embryos, including the formation of a yolk 
sac, amnion, and an embryonic disc with an early primitive streak. These results 
make these pluripotent cells strong candidates for marmoset embryonic stem cells.

Intraventricular infusion of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) in the
MPTP-treated common marmoset.

Author information: 
(1)Neurodegenerative Diseases Research Centre, King's College, London, UK.

Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) prevents damage to the nigrostriatal system
in rodents. We now report the effects of bFGF administered by intraventricular
infusion to adult common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) previously rendered
parkinsonian by the administration of 1-methy-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine
(MPTP). Infusion commenced 10 weeks after MPTP treatment and the animals received
bFGF in low (1.8 micrograms/l), medium (18 micrograms/l), or high (180
micrograms/l) doses over a 28-day period. At weekly intervals, automated activity
measurements, behavioral disability scoring, and videotape analyses were made.
There was no improvement in the motor deficits exhibited by MPTP-treated common
marmosets receiving bFGF infusion compared to vehicle-treated controls. Three of 
five high dose animals showed neurological impairment prior to the end of the
study. No significant differences were found between control and bFGF-infused
MPTP-treated common marmosets with respect to nigral tyrosine hydroxylase
immunoreactive cell counts and striatal [3H]mazindol binding. All high dose
animals showed hydrocephalus which was also observed in four other animals
receiving bFGF. Histological examination revealed proliferation of the choroid
plexus and ependyma which was most marked in the high dose animals. Adverse
effects, in the form of hydrocephalus and neurological deterioration, were
presumably secondary to an ependymal and choroid plexus reaction induced by bFGF.

Gongylonematiasis in the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).

Brack M(1).

Author information: 
(1)Deutsches Primatenzentrum GmbH, Abteilung Pathologie und Tierärztiche
Versorgung, Göttingen, Germany.

Two cases of gongylonematiasis in common marmosets of two research facilities in 
Germany are reported. The helminthiasis was transmitted from colony A to colony B
by one infected female and within colony B by cockroaches (Blatella germanica).
Four of 40 cockroaches examined in colony B were infected with rhabditiform
larvae. Clinical signs of disease in the infected animals consisted of intense
itching and scratching of the edematous and slightly hyperemic perioral tissues. 
Histologically the adult helminths lodged predominantly in the mucous membranes
of the upper and lower lips; they were less frequently present in the labial
cutaneous parts or in the tongue and could not be seen in the esophageal wall,
bronchi, or abdominal organs. The helminthic infection probably caused minor to
moderate mixed inflammatory infiltrates of the periesophageal connective tissues 
and intense inflammation of the deep lingual muscular tissues. Lesions of the
mucosal membranes of the lips and tongue had predominant accumulations of
neutrophilic granulocytes, lymphocytes, and mostly degranulated mast cells with
only a few eosinophilic granulocytes. In the cutaneous part of the lips
multifocal microabscesses were considered to be secondary lesions from the
intense scratching.

Effects of early parenting on growth and development in a small primate.

Author information: 
(1)Developmental Endocrinology Branch, National Institute of Child Health and
Human Development, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.

We report here a study of the impact of caregiver-infant relationships on
physical growth and behavioral development in a small primate, the common
marmoset. Somatic growth was assessed from measurements of body weight, knee-heel
length, head-tail length, head circumference, and pudendal pad width in females
or testis volume in males obtained from unanesthetized monkeys. Behavioral
information was gathered by focal animal samples for discrete rearing behaviors. 
Our data suggest that the frequency of positive parental behaviors during infancy
is correlated with stature when the monkeys reach 10 and 20 wk of age.
Furthermore, we found that juveniles that were mistreated by their parents during
infancy were smaller in body weight, knee-heel length, and head-tail length, and 
they demonstrated abnormal social behavior. Finally, to address whether the
apparent decreased growth observed in the young animals that had experienced
negative parenting was also associated with alterations in
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function, we examined the plasma ACTH
and cortisol responses to synthetic ovine corticotropin-releasing hormone (oCRH) 
in these animals. We found that the incremental cortisol response to exogenous
oCRH was significantly lower in the young adults that had experienced negative
parenting during infancy compared with those who had nonabusive parents,
indicating altered hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function in these animals.
Our findings suggest that the quality of parental care influences later growth
and behavior in the young marmoset.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection of the common marmoset causes long-term
infection, with production of antibodies to virus-induced antigens, without
clinical illness. Attempts to show the presence of EBV DNA in saliva of infected 
animals by PCR were initially unsuccessful, although slot-blot hybridization
analysis demonstrated that viral DNA was present. Further investigations showed
that most samples of pilocarpine-induced saliva, and 33% of the samples of whole 
mouth fluids (WMF) tested, were inhibitory to PCR. Similar results were found
using human WMF. A method of assessing samples of marmoset WMF for the presence
of EBV, by PCR using an EBV BamHI W probe, and removing inhibition with Chelex
100, is described. A total of 202 samples from 21 EBV infected, and seven
non-infected animals was tested. Five seropositive animals shed virus on every
occasion, and 15 intermittently. Two marmosets, infected as neonates, showed
progressively increasing humoral responses to viral antigens, and shed virus on
every occasion tested over 3 years. When mated with uninfected animals, the
latter seroconverted 4 and 6 weeks later, respectively, and later shed virus into
their WMF. The naturally infected animals were paired with naive marmosets, and
were able to pass on infection. These results establish that long-term,
permissive EBV infection occurs in the common marmoset, and demonstrate again the
similarities in the response to EBV between marmoset and man.

Amphetamine induces Fos-like immunoreactivity in the striatum of primates.

Author information: 
(1)Neuroscience Research Division, Pharmaceutical Discovery, Abbott Laboratories,
Abbott Park, IL 60064, USA.

Injections of D-amphetamine (5 mg/kg) three hours before sacrifice were found to 
elicit robust Fos-like immunoreactivity in the striatum of cynomolgus monkeys and
of the common marmoset. Labeled cells were most frequently observed in the medial
portion of the caudate nucleus and were distributed in a patchy fashion.
Comparison with adjacent sections stained for the calcium binding protein
calbindin indicated that the patches of amphetamine induced labeling corresponded
to the calbindin-poor striosomes. These results are consistent with those
reported in rats and thus suggest similarities in the basic organization of
striatal mechanisms underlying the response to amphetamine in rodents and
primates.

The digestive strategy of the common marmoset, Callithrix jacchus.

Caton JM(1), Hill DM, Hume ID, Crook GA.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Archaeology and Anthropology, Australian National University,
Canberra, Australia.

Digestive tract morphology and function were studied in the common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus), a small (350 g) exudivore with a well-developed caecum.
Transit times (times of first appearance of the markers in the faeces following a
pulse dose in the food) were similar for Co-EDTA, which marks the fluid phase of 
the digesta, and Cr-mordanted cell walls, which marked the large (600-1200
microns) particulate phase of the digesta. However, mean retention time (the
average time taken for the markers to transverse the whole digestive tract) for
Co-EDTA was significantly longer than for Cr-cell walls, indicating selective
retention of fluid digesta relative to large particles, probably in the caecum.
These data are consistent with a digestive strategy of the common marmoset that
appears to be based on rapid digestion of higher quality foods (animal prey,
fruits) in the small intestine, followed by microbial fermentation of the complex
polysaccharides of plant exudates in the caecum, which would allow for
considerable dietary flexibility in its natural habitat of scrub forests.

Maturation of sperm motility in the epididymis of the common marmoset (Callithrix
jacchus) and the cynomolgus monkey (Macaca fascicularis).

Yeung CH(1), Morrell JM, Cooper TG, Weinbauer GF, Hodges JK, Nieschlag E.

Author information: 
(1)Institute of Reproductive Medicine of the University, Münster, Germany.

The acquisition by spermatozoa of the capacity for movement upon liberation from 
the epididymal duct into buffer is one of the obvious changes associated with
sperm maturation and, hence, studies of sperm kinematics might provide good
indices for sperm maturation. Profiles of development in the movement pattern of 
spermatozoa taken from six regions of the epididymis were established in marmoset
and cynomolgus monkeys using computer-assisted sperm analysis. Motion of
spermatozoa from initial regions was sluggish and irregular, then developed in
the more distal region into erratic movement effected by an increase in the
vigour of flagellation as reflected by curvilinear velocity. The tendency of
immature spermatozoa to display circular motion was more common in the marmoset
than in the cynomolgus monkey. In the marmoset the most drastic changes in
percentage motility and kinematic parameters of spermatozoa occurred between the 
distal caput and the proximal corpus; maximal values for these parameters were
found around the distal corpus epididymis. For the cynomolgus spermatozoa the
sharpest gain in percentage motility was also achieved between the caput and
proximal corpus epididymis, but with full kinematic development in the proximal
cauda epididymis. These maturational changes were not synchronous among
spermatozoa from the same site as they moved along the epididymis, as reflected
in the heterogeneity of each sample in the kinematic properties of individual
spermatozoa, especially those from the proximal corpus epididymis. The
maturational profiles in the monkeys are comparable to the situation in the
human, for which they may provide a useful model.

The potential of the zona pellucida as a target for immunocontraception.

Aitken RJ(1), Paterson M, van Duin M.

Author information: 
(1)MRC Reproductive Biology Unit, Edinburgh, Scotland.

PROBLEM: To investigate the contraceptive potential of the zona pellucida.
METHOD: Generation of antibodies against native and recombinant zona
glycoproteins which have then been assessed for their capacity to disrupt
sperm-zona interaction in vivo and in vitro. The animal model selected for these 
studies was the common marmoset and the end points examined were antibody titre, 
ovarian cyclicity and fertility.
RESULTS: The fact that antibodies against the major zona glycoprotein, ZP3, block
both the primary and secondary phases of sperm-zona interaction suggests that
this molecule might have potential for contraceptive vaccine development. Active 
immunization of marmoset monkeys with native porcine ZP3 or recombinant human ZP3
produced long term infertility but also precipitated a premature decline in the
primordial follicle population.
CONCLUSIONS: Future studies will have to determine whether a safe, effective
vaccine can be engineered by coupling unique B-cell epitopes from ZP3 to foreign 
T-cell antigens.

Influence of semen collection method on ejaculate characteristics in the common
marmoset, Callithrix jacchus.

Morrell JM(1), Küderling I, Hodges JK.

Author information: 
(1)Deutsches Primatenzentrum, Göttingen, Germany.

A source of normal spermatozoa (sperm) is required for many andrological and
reproductive studies. Ideally the method used for semen collection should be
repeatable and reliable but should not influence sperm characteristics or sperm
function. Two methods of semen collection from marmosets, vaginal washing after
copulation and electroejaculation, were compared in terms of the success rate in 
obtaining samples and the characteristics of the sperm suspensions. Vaginal
washing was shown to be a reliable, repeatable, and apparently non-stressful
method of obtaining ejaculates, with 8 out of 10 males ejaculating on at least
four of the five attempts. The semen was of good quality as assessed by
conventional means, and the sperm were highly fertile when used for artificial
insemination (Al; 100% conception rate). In contrast, fewer ejaculates were
obtained from the same males by electroejaculation (success rate 30%), sperm
survival in vitro was reduced compared to sperm collected by vaginal washing
(0.93 +/- 0.15 days for electroejaculated sperm compared to 1.98 +/- 0.3 days for
sperm from vaginal washing), and the number of animals giving birth after Al was 
smaller (0 vs. 6; P < 0.05). The proportions of motile (74.8 vs. 70.7%), live
(84.7 vs. 81%), and morphologically normal (91.9 vs. 87.6%) sperm in the
ejaculates were not affected by the semen collection method, but velocity
parameters, such as curvilinear velocity, straight line velocity, and average
path velocity, as assessed by computerized motility analysis, were significantly 
lower in vaginal washings than in electroejaculates (P < 0.023, 0.008, and 0.008,
respectively). Mean angular deviation and beat cross frequency were greater in
vaginal washings than in electroejaculates (P < 0.016 and 0.008, respectively).
Therefore the effect of semen collection method on sperm function should always
be considered when designing reproductive studies.

The effect of stress on semen reduction in the marmoset monkey (Callithrix
jacchus).

Author information: 
(1)Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University of Adelaide, Queen
Elizabeth Hospital, Woodville, Australia.

This study compared a number of semen parameters of two separate groups of the
common marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus) in order to determine the effect of a
continuous potentially stressful situation on these parameters, and thus on the
monkey's reproductive ability. The semen from 16 adult male marmoset monkeys was 
collected and analysed to compare semen parameters between a 'normal' (control)
group (n = 9) and a 'blood withdrawn' ('stress') group (n = 7). The semen
parameter values observed in the control were: pH 7.51 +/- 0.22, volume 40.2 +/- 
27.2 microliters, concentration 27.3 +/- 14.8 x 10(4)/microliters, motility 47.4 
+/- 15.9%, grade of velocity 3.5 +/- 1.2, and normal morphological forms 51.8 +/-
13.7%. The 'blood withdrawn' group of marmoset monkeys showed significantly lower
semen volume and sperm concentration than the 'normal' group. In addition, total 
count of spermatozoa, normal spermatozoa, motile spermatozoa and normal motile
spermatozoa per ejaculate per monkey was significantly reduced in the 'blood
withdrawn' group. The semen of these monkeys also revealed a significantly higher
percentage of abnormally-shaped sperm heads than the normal group, and cases of
impotence and sham ejaculation were recorded. Our study revealed that the
continuous withdrawal of a small volume of blood from a group of marmoset monkeys
appeared to be stressful to these monkeys and as a result, influenced their semen
parameters, possibly making them less fertile. In addition, electroejaculation
was found to be possibly harmful to the monkey's reproductive ability.

The distribution of the dopamine D3 receptor was studied by receptor
autoradiography using [3H]7-OH-DPAT in striatal and extrastriatal brain regions
of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). Saturation studies demonstrated that
[3H]7-OH-DPAT bound with similar affinity to different regions of marmoset brain.
In normal marmosets, specific [3H]7-OH-DPAT binding was found in both striatal
and extrastriatal regions. Very high levels of specific [3H]7-OH-DPAT binding
were detected in the islands of Calleja and nucleus accumbens but in addition
high levels of binding were detected in rostral caudate nucleus and putamen. In
common marmosets treated with the selective nigral neurotoxin
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), the levels of specific
[3H]7-OH-DPAT binding in striatal and extrastriatal regions were not different to
those in normal animals. Chronic treatment of MPTP-treated marmosets with L-DOPA/
carbidopa did not alter the levels of specific [3H]7-OH-DPAT binding in any brain
region. These results demonstrate that in common marmosets D3 receptors are
located in both striatal and limbic regions. The receptor density is not altered 
by dopaminergic denervation or by chronic L-DOPA administration. The D3 receptor 
may, therefore, be important in both the therapeutic and adverse effects of drugs
used to treat Parkinson's disease.

Details of the endocrinology of reproduction in the genus Callithrix are known
only for the common marmoset, C. jacchus. This paper presents the patterns of
urinary pregnandiol-3-glucuronide (PdG), urinary estrone conjugates (E1C), and
gonadotropin excretion throughout the reproductive cycle of Wied's black
tufted-ear marmoset (C. kuhli) as determined via steroid conjugate enzyme
immunoassays (EIA) and gonadotropin radioimmunoassays (RIA). Postpartum ovulation
occurred at 13.6 ± 1.2 days after parturition (n = 12) and was characterized by
low PdG and E1C concentrations accompanied by a spike in luteinizing hormone
(LH)/chorionic gonadotropin (CG) concentration. After conception, PdG
concentrations increased dramatically until they dropped to periovulatory
concentrations in the third trimester of pregnancy. Mean PdG concentrations in
the first and second trimesters (33.7 ± 8.4 and 39.0 ± 10.9 μg/mg creatinine,
respectively) were three times that of third trimester concentrations (11.7 ± 1.4
μg/mg Cr; n = 8). Urinary concentrations of E1C rose more gradually during
pregnancy and remained higher prepartum than urinary concentrations of PdG.
Urinary gonadotropin concentrations also increased after conception (first
trimester concentrations = 24.5 ± 4.5 ng/mg Cr) and continued to increase in the 
second trimester (51.4 ± 7.6 ng/mg Cr), until they finally decreased in the third
trimester (mean = 7.9 ± 1.4 ng/mg Cr; n = 8). The interbirth interval was 156.3 ±
2.9 days (n = 6), with a gestation of 143.1 ± 1.6 days (n = 8). Nonconceptive
cycle length was 24.9 ± 0.6 days (n = 4). The results of this study suggest
strong similarities in reproductive parameters in the genus Callithrix. © 1996

Gonadal steroids were measured in daily fecal samples providing comparative data 
on steroid metabolism in two genera of New World primates. Circulating bioactive 
LH and progesterone concentrations and fecal progesterone, pregnanediol,
estradiol, and estrone concentrations were measured by collecting blood and daily
fecal samples from four captive common marmoset females and four cotton-top
tamarin females for 30 days. High recoveries (> 80%) of labeled steroids that
were added directly to the feces before extraction were recovered from feces of
both species. Because of the presence of complex steroid conjugates, only one
fifth the amount of estradiol was measured without solvolysis as compared to the 
amount measured with solvolysis. In tamarins, steroids were metabolized rapidly, 
with all postovulatory increases occurring within two days after the circulating 
LH peak (an increase of 2 SD higher than mean follicular levels). In marmosets,
steroid excretion was slower; increased steroid levels occurred 2-4 days after
the LH peak except in the case of estrone, which did not consistently increase
after the LH peak. Circulating estrone and estradiol both contributed to the high
excretion of estradiol in the feces from both species. The timing in the delay in
excretion of fecal steroids was used to accurately determine the ovulatory period
to within a 2-day window. This degree of accuracy is possible when the duration
of the delay to the LH peak is known for a given species. Additionally, steroid
concentrations were highly correlated between frozen and lyophilized fecal
samples (0.81 +/- 0.07 SEM), indicating that fluid removal from the feces did not
effectively alter steroid profiles.

human data.

In the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus jacchus) immunoglobulin E (IgE) serum 
levels and IgE synthesis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in vitro
were investigated in order to look for homologies to the human system. While IgE 
was not found in marmoset blood plasma with three commercial antihuman IgE-kits
with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), two other kits using polyclonal antibodies
against human IgE revealed detectable IgE concentrations of up to 10 kU/liter in 
plasma samples of 19 out of 21 marmosets. In accord with human data, rhIL-4
showed biological functions under in vitro conditions in PBMC of the New World
monkey. Proliferation, measured by 3H-thymidine incorporation, of isolated PBMC
of marmosets could be induced by rhIL-4. FACScan analysis showed an enhanced
expression of the low affinity IgE receptor CD23 (Fc epsilon RII) on CD20+ B
lymphocytes after incubation with rhIL-4. Furthermore, PBMC from marmosets could 
be stimulated by IL-4 alone or in combination with dexamethasone as well as with 
lipopolysaccharide (E. coli) to produce IgE in culture. The results indicate that
Callithrix jacchus is using an IgE system that is rather similar to that of
humans, although not completely identical. Antihuman mAbs and rhIL-4 can be used 
to investigate IgE regulation in vitro of marmoset PBMC. These data encourage the
development of a primate animal model for studying possible modifications of the 
IgE system under pathological conditions to find new therapeutic strategies in
atopic diseases.

Acute MPTP treatment produces no changes in mitochondrial complex activities and

exposure to the toxin.

1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) has been shown to cause a
Parkinsonian syndrome in man and non-human primates. Hypotheses concerning the
pathogenetic mechanisms of MPTP toxicity on nigro-striatal dopaminergic neurons
relate to impairment of mitochondrial function and oxidative stress. However,
surprisingly few primate studies addressed these issues ex vivo. Thus, the
present study assessed the enzyme activities of the respiratory chain, GSH/GSSG
and ubiquinol/ubiquinone content in the MPTP primate model (common marmoset,
Callithrix jacchus; 2 mg MPTP-hydrochloride/kg body wt were injected
subcutaneously (s.c.) on four consecutive days; animals were sacrificed 7 days
after last MPTP exposure). Activities of respiratory chain enzymes were measured 
in crude homogenates of the caudate nucleus, because the probable toxic
metabolite of MPTP, MPP+, is transported into dopaminergic neurons via the
dopamine uptake system in striatal synapses and mitochondria are concentrated in 
axonal terminals. Since MPP+ can damage membranes of axonal terminals of
nigro-striatal neurons we measured GSH/GSSG contents in the putamen and
ubiquinol/ubiquinone concentrations in the substantia nigra and putamen as
indices of oxidative damage. At the time of sacrifice MPTP-induced deficits
comprised severe behavioural Parkinsonian symptoms, profound depletion of
striatal dopamine and its major metabolites as well as pronounced loss of
nigro-striatal neurons. Despite these severe lesions, acute MPTP treatment had no
effect on any of the enzymes of the respiratory chain in the caudate nucleus and 
indices of oxidative damage in both the substantia nigra and putamen. These
results suggest that factors other than mitochondrial impairment and/or oxidative
stress may be involved in MPTP neurotoxicity in primates. Alternatively, early
compensatory mechanisms and/or transient effects could account for the reported
results and will be discussed.

Fifty common marmoset pregnancies were monitored using ultrasound. The objective 
was to ascertain if fetal mortality was related to litter size. Prior to analysis
we determined abortion rate and litter size were not influenced by repeated
ultrasound. Mortality was unrelated to litter size and occurred fairly late in
gestation. All singletons born in this study began gestation as twins. It is
hypothesized that marmosets may be able to adjust litter size late in pregnancy
in response to proximate environmental factors.

(Callithrix jacchus).

The organization of the primary visual cortex (VI) of the common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus) was studied both physiologically and by means of
transneuronal labelling of geniculocortical afferents. We addressed the question 
whether monocular deprivation (MD) could stabilize segregation into ocular
dominance (OD) columns, which are not seen in normal adult marmosets but are
present in juvenile animals (Spatz, 1979, 1989). Properties of neurons in normal 
marmosets closely resembled those of other New-World and Old-World monkeys and
orderly tangential progressions of preferred orientation were observed. However, 
in contrast to species that display well-defined OD columns, neurons of layer 4
in V1 of normal adult marmosets received balanced inputs from the two eyes. Early
MD (even though followed by prolonged binocular experience into adulthood)
resulted in a reduction of cell size in laminae of the lateral geniculate nucleus
with input from the deprived eye and a dramatic overall shift in ocular dominance
towards the nondeprived eye in the cortex. However, isolated clusters of cells
dominated by the deprived eye were found in both layers 4 and 6. Injection of
lectin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) into the deprived eye revealed
elongated patches of terminal label, about 350 microns wide, in flat-mounted
sections through layer 4. Afferent segregation was sharper and more regular in
the region of V1 representing parafoveal visual space than in that representing
the fovea. Our findings support the notion that all Old-World and New-World
monkeys possess the capacity for segregation of geniculocortical afferents into
OD columns.

Cross-reactivity of antihuman monoclonal antibodies with cell surface receptors
in the common marmoset.

Neubert R(1), Foerster M, Nogueira AC, Helge H.

Author information:

In this report we demonstrate that a large number of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs)
against human epitopes cross-react with surface receptors on white blood cells of
Callithrix jacchus, indicating species similarities. However, a variety of other 
mAbs do not exhibit any cross-reactivity, thus also providing evidence for
distinct differences in the structure of these receptors among nonhuman primates.
Such differences have to be known and taken into consideration when attempting
extrapolations between species. The results presented provide the prerequisite
for performing extensive studies on immunological structures and functions in
marmosets under normal and pathological conditions. We conclude that the immune
system of Callithrix jacchus is a convenient model for studies on immunotoxicity 
with relevance for man, and for this purpose it is clearly superior to that of
any rodent species.

Representation of a species-specific vocalization in the primary auditory cortex 
of the common marmoset: temporal and spectral characteristics.

(1)Coleman Laboratory, University of California, San Francisco 94143-0732, USA.

1. The temporal and spectral characteristics of neural representations of a
behaviorally important species-specific vocalization were studied in neuronal
populations of the primary auditory cortex (A1) of barbiturate-anesthetized adult
common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus), using both natural and synthetic
vocalizations. The natural vocalizations used in electrophysiological experiments
were recorded from the animals under study or from their conspecifics. These
calls were frequently produced in vocal exchanges between members of our marmoset
colony and are part of the well-defined and highly stereotyped vocal repertoire
of this species. 2. The spectrotemporal discharge pattern of spatially
distributed neuron populations in cortical field A1 was found to be correlated
with the spectrotemporal acoustic pattern of a complex natural vocalization.
However, the A1 discharge pattern was not a faithful replication of the acoustic 
parameters of a vocalization stimulus, but had been transformed into a more
abstract representation than that in the auditory periphery. 3. Subpopulations of
A1 neurons were found to respond selectively to natural vocalizations as compared
with synthetic variations that had the same spectral but different temporal
characteristics. A subpopulation responding selectively to a given monkey's call 
shared some but not all of its neuronal memberships with other
individual-call-specific neuronal subpopulations. 4. In the time domain,
responses of individual A1 units were phase-locked to the envelope of a portion
of a complex vocalization, which was centered around a unit's characteristic
frequency (CF). As a whole, discharges of A1 neuronal populations were
phase-locked to discrete stimulus events but not to their rapidly changing
spectral contents. The consequence was a reduction in temporal complexity and an 
increase in cross-population response synchronization. 5. In the frequency
domain, major features of the stimulus spectrum were reflected in rate-CF
profiles. The spectral features of a natural call were equally or more strongly
represented by a subpopulation of A1 neurons that responded selectively to that
call as compared with the entire responding A1 population. 6. Neuronal responses 
to a complex call were distributed very widely across cortical field A1. At the
same time, the responses evoked by a vocalization scattered in discrete cortical 
patches were strongly synchronized to stimulus events and to each other. As a
result, at any given time during the course of a vocalization, a coherent
representation of the integrated spectrotemporal characteristics of a particular 
vocalization was present in a specific neuronal population. 7. These results
suggest that the representation of behaviorally important and spectrotemporally
complex species-specific vocalizations in A1 is 1) temporally integrated and 2)
spectrally distributed in nature, and that the representation is carried by
spatially dispersed and synchronized cortical cell assemblies that correspond to 
each individual's vocalizations in a specific and abstracted way.

In the human disease multiple sclerosis (MS), the immune mechanisms responsible
for selective destruction of central nervous system myelin are unknown. In the
common marmoset Callithrix jacchus, a unique demyelinating form of experimental
allergic encephalomyelitis resembling MS can be induced by immunization with
whole myelin. Here we show that the MS-like lesion can be reproduced by
immunization against the extracellular domain of a single myelin protein,
myelin/oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG). By contrast, immunization against the 
quantitatively major myelin proteins myelin basic protein or proteolipid protein 
results in inflammation but little or no demyelination. Furthermore, in the
presence of encephalitogenic (e.g., disease-inducing) T cells, the fully
demyelinated lesion is reconstructed by systemic administration of IgG purified
from whole myelin-, or MOG-immunized animals, and equally by a monoclonal
antibody against MOG, but not by control IgG. Encephalitogenic T cells may
contribute to the MS-like lesion through disruption of the blood-brain barrier
that permits access of demyelinating antibody into the nervous system. The
identification of MOG as a major target antigen for autoimmune demyelination in a
nonhuman primate should facilitate development of specific immunotherapies for
human MS.

Chronic L-DOPA administration induces dyskinesias in the 1-methyl-4-

Dyskinesias occur in the majority of patients with Parkinson's disease
chronically treated with L-DOPA and also occur in several nonhuman primate
species after 1-methyl-4phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) and L-DOPA
treatment. The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) shows parkinsonian motor
deficits after MPTP administration, and we now report dyskinesias occurring in
this species during chronic L-DOPA exposure. Marmosets rendered chronically
parkinsonian after MPTP administration were treated orally with L-DOPA plus
carbidopa for 3 weeks. After several days the animals began to display chorea,
choreoathetosis, and dystonia. The severity of dyskinesias varied between the
animals, with the most severely parkinsonian animals displaying the most
dyskinetic movements. Each animal showed an idiosyncratic pattern of dyskinesias,
which was highly reproducible. These L-DOPA-primed animals also received other D2
D1, and mixed D1/D2 agonist drugs. Quinpirole, bromocriptine, pergolide,
apomorphine, and A-77636 all produce dyskinesias that were identical in character
to those seen after L-DOPA administration, but the D1 agonist A-77636 gradually
abolished dyskinesias while preserving its antiparkinsonian activity. The
MPTP-treated marmoset provides a useful model in which to study dyskinesias in
Parkinson's disease and to examine new therapeutic strategies aimed at
alleviating this common side effect of chronic dopamine replacement therapy.

Previous immunocytochemical studies in rats have indicated that striatal dopamine
depletion leads to an increase in enkephalin-immunoreactivity and a decrease in
substance P-immunoreactivity in the striatum. Similar studies in primates have
lead to contradictory results. In the present study changes in tyrosine
hydroxylase-, met-enkephalin- and substance P-immunoreactivity were determined in
the basal ganglia of 6 common marmosets Callithrix jacchus following dopamine
depletion by unilateral intracerebral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) injections using
three different survival times. The non-lesioned side served as an
intra-individual control. Tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity was strongly
reduced in the entire ipsilateral striatum. Enkephalin-immunoreactivity was
increased throughout the striatum. Substance P-immunoreactivity was significantly
increased in only one case in the caudate nucleus and in two cases in the
putamen, while in other cases either a non-significant increase or decrease was
found. Therefore, the results of the present study indicate that in marmosets
dopamine has a inhibiting effect on the levels of striatal enkephalin, while its 
effect on substance P (SP) appears to be absent.

Patterns of relaxin and steroids in the reproductive cycle of the common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus): effects of prostaglandin F2 alpha on relaxin and
progesterone secretion during pregnancy.

We measured the concentrations of relaxin (Rlx), progesterone, and estradiol-17
beta in serum samples obtained twice or three times weekly from marmosets during 
the estrous cycle and pregnancy. The cyclic patterns and concentrations of
progesterone and estradiol-17 beta were similar to those reported by previous
investigators. Rlx was not detected in individual serum samples ( < 0.62-1.25
ng/ml) obtained from nonpregnant marmosets. However, pooling of luteal serum from
all animals permitted assay of much larger volumes of serum (0.4 ml vs. 0.1 ml), 
and a concentration of about 1 ng/ml was detected. Rlx was first detected in
serum in the second or third week of the 21-wk marmoset pregnancy, rose to a peak
during Weeks 10-14, and then declined slowly as the time of parturition
approached. The pattern of Rlx was unlike that observed during pregnancy in Old
World monkeys, chimpanzees, or women, and resembled, instead, that seen in
rodents, carnivores, and equids. Progesterone and estradiol-17 beta likewise
increased throughout pregnancy, and their patterns were similar to those
previously described for marmosets by other investigators. The concentrations of 
the steroids and Rlx in serum of pregnant marmosets was 10-fold or more higher
than those found in Old World monkeys, baboons, chimpanzees, or women.
Spontaneous abortions in two of the marmosets were accompanied by precipitous
falls in serum levels of progesterone, estradiol-17 beta, and Rlx. Following s.c.
injection of the luteolytic agent prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha) into two
marmosets at midpregnancy, serum progesterone and Rlx fell to low levels. These
animals received a progestin, 17 alpha-ethyl-19-nortesterone, to preclude
abortion. Serum progesterone rose again, but serum Rlx remained low for the
duration of pregnancy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Luteinizing hormone/chorionic gonadotropin bioactivity in the common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus) is due to a chorionic gonadotropin molecule with a structure
intermediate between human chorionic gonadotropin and human luteinizing hormone.

Elizabeth Hospital, Australia.

Chorionic gonadotropin (CG), a pregnancy-specific heterodimeric hormone found in 
primates, is responsible for CL rescue with pregnancy maintenance. Of the
primates, the human and baboon gene sequences are the only structures so far
determined. In order to study the structure and function of CG in other primates,
we have isolated and sequenced the coding regions for the two subunits of
marmoset CG (mCG) by the reverse transcription/polymerase chain reaction method. 
Study of multiple clones confirmed a high degree of homology with the human
sequences (88% and 80% for the alpha and beta nucleotide sequences,
respectively). Marmoset CG alpha has an extra four amino acids compared to hCG
alpha, whereas the mCG beta sequence has a 3-bp deletion that maintains the
reading frame and C-terminal amino acid sequence. Most of the differences between
hCG beta and mCG beta peptides occur in the C-terminal region, which includes the
loss of two of the O-linked glycosylation consensus sequences and the presence of
an N-linked glycosylation consensus sequence. When mCG alpha and beta were
co-expressed in CHO cells, assembly of biologically active hormone was confirmed 
by induced steroid secretion by MA10 cells. Partially purified mCG beta was used 
to raise anti-mCG antibodies. To date, an antibody has been obtained that is
capable of detecting recombinant mCG beta, recombinant mCG dimer, and mCG dimer
secreted by cultured marmoset trophoblast. Marmoset CG alpha and beta were also
detectable at the transcriptional level in cultured trophoblast by in situ
hybridization. This suggests that the LH/CG bioactivity reported from marmoset
placentae and embryos is due to a molecule with structural features common to hLH
(glycosylation pattern) and hCG (CG beta C-terminal structure).

presented. The common marmoset is one of the New World monkeys with a body weight
of 300-350 g. It is small enough to be easily handled and to be kept as a group
in a room. In the fields of pharmacology, it has been used in studies of plasma
renin activity inhibitors, lipoprotein, memory/learning, obstetrics,
transplantation, toxicology, anxiolytic agents and virology/immunology. We showed
that the common marmoset was a useful animal for studies on Parkinson's disease, 
dopamine metabolism by microdialysis and nausea/vomiting. The common marmoset was
sensitive to 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) and developed
permanent parkinsonism after MPTP injection. MPTP-treated common marmosets showed
tremor and akinesia, and it remarkably responded to antiparkinsonian agents. A
dopamine D1 agonist, which caused stereotyped behavior in rats, did not reverse
parkinsonism in humans. We showed this agent did not have any antiparkinsonian
effects on MPTP-treated common marmosets. MAO has subtypes, A and B, that have
differences of distribution in different species. MAO type B inhibitors were
applied for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. MAO subtype B inhibitors do not
cause any change in behavior or extracellular concentration of dopamine or its
metabolites in rodents. In MPTP-treated common marmosets, however, administration
of a MAO type B inhibitor increased the antiparkinsonian effects of levodopa and 
decreased dopamine metabolites. The common marmoset is a suitable animal for the 
study of MAO type B inhibitors.

The distribution of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) within the brain of the common
marmoset, a non-human primate species, was investigated using the
[3H]L-citrulline formation assay and Western blot analysis. No hemispheric
asymmetry of specific NOS activity was shown. The highest levels of NOS were
found in the putamen and caudate nucleus--more than twice those in the cortex and
the cerebellum, the brain regions with the lowest activities. The regional
distribution pattern was similar to that in the ferret brain and contrasted to
that in the mouse and bovine brain. Analysis of NOS catalytic activities in
subcellular fractions revealed marked differences in the subcellular
localization. Neuronal NOS accounted mainly for the measured catalytic activity
in the brain. Differences in the regional distribution pattern of brain NOS
activity among species may be indicative of diversities in the functional role of
nitric oxide and NOS in mammals.

Short- and long-term changes in striatal and extrastriatal dopamine uptake sites 
in the MPTP-treated common marmoset.

The 'short-term' (15-30 days) and 'long-term' (18-42 months) effects of the
systemic administration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) on
[3H]mazindol binding to dopamine uptake sites was investigated in the common
marmoset. In the 'short-term' MPTP-treated group, [3H]mazindol binding was
reduced in the caudate-putamen (by -82 to -98% with respect to controls),
substantia nigra pars compacta (-71 to -84%), ventral tegmental area (-72%) and
nucleus accumbens (-54%). [3H]Mazindol binding in the globus pallidus, frontal
cortex and substantia nigra pars reticulata was much lower and was unaffected by 
MPTP treatment. In the 'long-term' MPTP-treated group [3H]mazindol binding was
still greatly reduced in the substantia nigra pars compacta (by -76 to -89%),
ventral tegmental area (-71%) and most of the caudate-putamen (-69 to -98%),
although the reduction in [3H]mazindol binding in the nucleus accumbens (-27%)
and rostroventral caudate nucleus (-69%) was less than in the 'short-term'
MPTP-treated group. The motor deficits induced by MPTP treatment in the common
marmoset are largely reversible with increasing survival times (Ueki et al.,
1989, Neuropharmacology 28, 1089). In the present study, the apparent 'recovery' 
in [3H]mazindol binding in the rostroventral caudate nucleus and nucleus
accumbens may indicate regeneration of dopamine neurone terminals in these
regions and this may contribute to the behavioural recovery seen in this primate 
model of Parkinson's disease.

The connections of the lateral terminal nucleus (LTN) of the accessory optic
system (AOS) of the marmoset monkey were studied with anterograde 3H-amino acid
light autoradiography and horseradish peroxidase retrograde labeling techniques. 
Results show a first and largest LTN projection to the pretectal and AOS nuclei
including the ipsilateral nucleus of the optic tract, dorsal terminal nucleus,
and interstitial nucleus of the superior fasciculus (posterior fibers); smaller
contralateral projections are to the olivary pretectal nucleus, dorsal terminal
nucleus, and LTN. A second, major bundle produces moderate-to-heavy labeling in
all ipsilateral, accessory oculomotor nuclei (nucleus of posterior commissure,
interstitial nucleus of Cajal, nucleus of Darkschewitsch) and nucleus of
Bechterew; some of the fibers are distributed above the caudal oculomotor complex
within the supraoculomotor periaqueductal gray. A third projection is ipsilateral
to the pontine and mesencephalic reticular formations, nucleus reticularis
tegmenti pontis and basilar pontine complex (dorsolateral nucleus only), dorsal
parts of the medial terminal accessory optic nucleus, ventral tegmental area of
Tsai, and rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus.
Lastly, there are two long descending bundles: (1) one travels within the medial 
longitudinal fasciculus to terminate in the dorsal cap (ipsilateral >>
contralateral) and medial accessory olive (ipsilateral only) of the inferior
olivary complex. (2) The second soon splits, sending axons within the ipsilateral
and contralateral brachium conjunctivum and is distributed to the superior and
medial vestibular nuclei. The present findings are in general agreement with the 
documented connections of LTN with brainstem oculomotor centers in other species.
In addition, there are unique connections in marmoset monkey that may have
developed to serve the more complex oculomotor behavior of nonhuman primates.

Experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) is an autoimmune disease of the
central nervous system that serves as a model for the human disease multiple
sclerosis. We evaluated rolipram, a type IV phosphodiesterase inhibitor, for its 
efficacy in preventing EAE in the common marmoset Callithrix jacchus. In a
blinded experimental design, clinical signs of EAE developed within 17 days of
immunization with human white matter in two placebo-treated animals but in none
of three monkeys that received rolipram (10 mg/kg s.c. every other day) beginning
1 week after immunization. In controls, signs of EAE were associated with
development of cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis and cerebral MRI abnormalities. In
the treatment group, there was sustained protection from clinical EAE, transient 
cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis in only one of three animals, no MRI abnormality,
and marked reduction in histopathologic findings. Rolipram-treated and control
animals equally developed circulating antibodies to myelin basic protein. Thus,
inhibition of type IV phosphodiesterase, initiated after sensitization to central
nervous system antigens, protected against autoimmune demyelinating disease.

Active and passively induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in common

A chronic relapsing-remitting form of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis
was induced in the common marmoset Callithrix jacchus following a single
immunization with human white matter. Individual animals in this species are born
as natural bone marrow chimeras, allowing transfer of functional T-cell
populations between genetically distinct siblings. The acute disease was
characterized clinically by mild neurological signs. Pathologically, the disease 
was characterized by perivascular mononuclear cell infiltrates, large foci of
primary demyelination, and reactive astrogliosis. No animal displayed
hemorrhagic-necrotic lesions or polymorphonuclear cell infiltrates characteristic
of other acute forms of primate experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. A late
spontaneous relapse occurred in each of 2 animals followed for 3 to 12 months
subsequent to recovery from the acute attack. In these animals, chronic lesions
consisted of mononuclear cell infiltrates within large sharply defined areas of
demyelination and astrogliosis, and resembled active plaques of chronic multiple 
sclerosis. Proliferative responses to myelin basic protein but not to myelin
proteolipid protein were present in peripheral blood lymphocytes of immunized
animals. Furthermore, myelin basic protein-reactive T-cell lines derived from
immunized donors induced clinical signs of experimental autoimmune
encephalomyelitis when adoptively transferred into a sibling, indicating that
myelin basic protein-reactive T cells can induce disease in this species. Because
of its clinical and pathological similarity to human multiple sclerosis and the
ability to adoptively transfer experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, this
model system should prove useful in the analysis of the immunological mechanisms 
responsible for autoimmune demyelination in outbred primates.

Quantitative receptor autoradiography of eight different transmitter-binding
sites in the hippocampus of the common marmoset, Callithrix jacchus.

Author information:

The regional and laminar distributions of eight different transmitter-binding
sites were measured in the marmoset hippocampus by means of quantitative in vitro
receptor autoradiography. Receptors for 5-HT1, L-glutamate, N-methyl-D-aspartate 
(NMDA) and GABAA were similarly distributed. The highest concentrations of these 
receptors were found in the pyramidal layer of CA1 and the molecular layer of the
dentate gyrus. The 5-HT2 receptors showed the highest concentrations in the
oriens layer of CA2. The highest concentrations of muscarinic M1 receptors were
seen in the pyramidal layer of CA1. Muscarinic M2 receptors were most densely
concentrated in the pyramidal layers of CA1, CA2 and CA3. The noradrenergic alpha
1 receptors were most densely packed in the radiatum-lacunosum-molecular layer of
CA2 and the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. Statistically significant
co-distributions of serotoninergic, glutamatergic and GABAergic receptors point
to possible interactions between these receptor systems in the same hippocampal
regions and layers. Comparisons of marmoset distribution patterns for GABAA,
NMDA, L-glutamate and 5-HT1 receptors with those in human hippocampi and those of
other primates showed similarities between them. Clear differences in the
patterns of alpha 1, M1, M2 and 5-HT2 receptors could be seen between marmoset
and human hippocampi, indicating a high degree of species specificity in a
presumably "conservative" brain region. More similarities, however, could be
found between marmoset and human hippocampi than between those of rat and human
brains, especially in relation to 5-HT1 and GABAA receptors and
L-glutamate-binding sites.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Differential anti-parkinsonian effects of benzazepine D1 dopamine agonists with
varying efficacies in the MPTP-treated common marmoset.

Author information: 
(1)Parkinson's Disease Society Experimental Research Laboratories, King's College
London, UK.

In common marmosets systemically treated with MPTP
(1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine), the behavioural effects of
benzazepine D1 dopamine (DA) agonists with full/supramaximal (SKF 80723 and SKF
82958), partial (SKF 38393, SKF 75670 and SKF 83565) and no efficacies (SKF
83959) in stimulating adenylate cyclase (AC) activity were investigated. The
benzazepine derivatives, with the exception of SKF 82958 (8 fold D1 DA receptor
selectivity), demonstrated high D1 DA receptor affinity and selectivity
(approximately 100 fold or more) in rat striatal homogenates. Administration of
MPTP in marmosets induced locomotor hypoactivity, rigidity and motor disability. 
SKF 38393 (7,8-dihydroxy-1-phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3- benzazepine) and SKF
75670 (3-CH3 analogue) further reduced locomotor activity (by -70 to -80%) and
increased motor disability (by +22 to +67%) in these animals. SKF 83565 (6-Cl,
3-CH3, 3'-Cl analogue) and SKF 82958 (6-Cl, 3-C3H5 analogue) had only a slight
effect on locomotor activity but decreased motor disability at high doses (-46 to
-60%). In contrast, SKF 83959 (6-Cl, 3-CH3, 3'-CH3 analogue) and SKF 80723 (6-Br 
analogue) produced pronounced increases in locomotion (6-10 fold) and a reversal 
in motor disability (by -64 to -77%). Oral activity, consisting largely of
abnormal, 'dyskinetic' tongue protrusions and vacuous chews, was increased in
animals treated with SKF 38393, SKF 83565, SKF 82958 and more especially with SKF
80723 and SKF 83959. Grooming was increased with SKF 82958 and more especially
with SKF 80723 and SKF 83959. In contrast, quinpirole (D2 DA agonist), reversed
the MPTP-induced motor deficits in the marmoset, with no effect on grooming and
oral activity. The present findings further demonstrate the antiparkinsonian
actions of some D1 DA agonists in MPTP-treated primates. However, in general the 
behavioural effects of benzazepines failed to correlate with either their D1 DA
receptor affinity/selectivity or their efficacy in stimulating adenylate cyclase 
(AC) activity. These observations further implicate a behavioural role for D1 DA 
receptors uncoupled to AC and/or a role for extrastriatal D1 DA receptors in
mediating the behavioural response to D1 DA agonists.

The increasing use of non-human primates to study fetal development and neonatal 
management has necessitated the availability of fetuses of known gestational
history. In this study, prenatal development and growth were investigated in the 
common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) using ultrasound. The objectives of this
study were: (1) to determine the accuracy of ultrasound for monitoring prenatal
growth and development in common marmosets, (2) to determine if litter size
influences prenatal growth trajectories, and (3) to assess growth discordancy
among litter mates. Fifty pregnancies were monitored longitudinally using
real-time abdominal sonography. During each examination the number of fetuses was
recorded, and crown-rump length (CRL) and biparietal diameter (BPD) were
measured. The results indicate that ultrasound is a reliable method for
observation of gross morphological changes during prenatal development in this
species. Measures of CRL and BPD taken early in gestation using ultrasound were
in agreement with those from gross specimens. Triplets were significantly (P <
0.05) smaller than twins for both BPD and CRL. No significant relationship was
found between litter size and within litter variation in CRL or BPD. This study
is the first longitudinal investigation of prenatal growth and development in C. 
jacchus. The observations from this study will be of use for determining
approximate gestational age of fetuses, as well as providing guidelines for
routine monitoring of pregnancy in this species. © 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Detection of pregnancy and monitoring patterns of uterine and fetal growth in the
marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus) by real-time ultrasonography.

Author information:

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential of real-time
ultrasonography for detecting and monitoring pregnancy in the common marmoset.
Ultrasound was performed transabdominally on unsedated females using a 7.5 MHz
linear or intraoperative sector probe. Pregnancies were timed using progesterone 
measurements in twice weekly blood samples to determine the day of ovulation.
Eight pregnancies were examined three times a week until day 30, twice a week
until day 80, and once a week until birth. Detection of pregnancy was possible on
day 15, on average, by the appearance of a double endometrial echo indicating
fluid accumulation in the uterus. The uterine lumen thus formed was first
measurable on day 21 on average. Diameter of the pregnant uterus was
significantly greater than that of the nonpregnant organ by day 38. Thereafter,
the dimensions of uterus and uterine lumen showed a similar pattern of growth
until day 75, when measurements became inaccurate due to increasing uterine
pliability. Embryonic development was characterized by the initial expansion of
the gestation sacs and the appearance of individual embryos by day 33. Detection 
of heart beat at approximately day 54 allowed confirmation of number and
viability of the embryos. With the visualization of the skulls by day 82, it was 
possible to determine fetal position and to monitor fetal growth by measurement
of the biparietal diameter. All pregnancies were of normal length (140-145 days) 
resulting in viable offspring. It can be concluded that ultrasonography is
suitable for detecting and monitoring pregnancy in the marmoset monkey and as a
non-invasive method, has the potential for being routinely used in this and other
species of Callitrichidae. © 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Group size, composition, and reproductive success in wild common marmosets
(Callithrix jacchus).

Koenig A(1).

Author information: 
(1)Institute of Anthropology, University of Göttingen, Göttingen, Germany.

Data from published sources about size and composition of wild common marmoset
groups (Callithrix jacchus) were analyzed to see if the number of juveniles in a 
group is closely related to the number of other group members. Mean group size
was 8.7 members including 4.4 adults (1.8 females, 2.5 males), 2.9 subadults, and
1.4 juveniles. The number of juveniles was significantly positively correlated to
the number of adult males. Groups with one or two adult males had significantly
fewer juveniles (mean: 1:1 juveniles) than groups containing more than two adult 
males (mean: 2.0 juveniles). Apart from a different number of subadults, results 
showed obvious similarities between common marmosets and tamarins of the genus
Saguinus in size and composition of subgroups of adults as well as the key role
of adult males in mediating the reproductive success of a breeding female. Common
marmoset females seem to gain direct fitness benefits in increased reproductive
success from the presence of a larger number of adult males. Whether or not other
group members get fitness benefits depends on the reproductive strategy of adult 
males (monogamy vs. polyandry), their kinship, and on the genetic relationship of
nonbreeders to the offspring of the breeding female. © 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Short and long-term changes in cerebral [14C]-2-deoxyglucose uptake in the
MPTP-treated marmoset: relationship to locomotor activity.

Gnanalingham KK(1), Milkowski NA, Smith LA, Hunter AJ, Jenner P, Marsden CD.

Author information: 
(1)Parkinson's Disease Society Experimental Research Laboratories, King's
College, London, United Kingdom.

The "short-term" (0.7 +/- 0.1 months post-MPTP) and "long-term" effects (36.7 +/-
4.4 months) of MPTP treatment on motor behaviour and [14C]-2DG uptake were
investigated in the common marmoset. The subcutaneous administration of MPTP
greatly reduced locomotor activity (-94% with respect to controls) and induced
motor disability in the "short-term" MPTP-treated marmoset group. In the
"long-term" MPTP group, MPTP treatment did not significantly affect locomotor
activity (-27% with respect to controls) and there was partial recovery of motor 
disability. In the "short-term" MPTP group, there were increases in [14C]-2DG
uptake in the GPl (+31 to +37%), SNc (+34 to +42%), VTA (+35%), LC (+23%), PPN
(+19%) and in the VA (+19%), VL (+20%) and AM (+17%) thalamic nuclei. [14C]-2DG
uptake was decreased in the STN (-15%). In the "long-term" MPTP group, [14C]-2DG 
uptake was increased in the GPl (+18%), SNc (+27%), VTA (+25%), PPN (+19%),
ventral caudate nucleus (+18 to +23%), NAc (+22%), F.Ctx (+18%) and in the VA
(+34%), VL (+28%), AV (+33%) and AM (+24%) thalamic nuclei. [14C]-2DG uptake was 
unchanged in the STN. The increase in metabolic activity of the surviving DA
neurones and/or the reactive gliosis may account for the initial increase in
[14C]-2DG uptake in the SNc and VTA. On the other hand, in the "long-term"
MPTP-treated animals the increase in [14C]-2DG uptake in the SNc (though less
than in the "short-term" MPTP group), ventral caudate and NAc may reflect the
regenerative changes in the dopaminergic system in these areas. Despite the
behavioural recovery, [14C]-2DG uptake remained elevated in the target areas for 
medial pallidal output (the thalamic nuclei and PPN). However, the attenuation of
the changes in [14C]-2DG uptake in the GPl and STN of "long-term" MPTP-treated
marmosets suggest that the striato-GPl and GPl-STN outputs closely reflect motor 
function in this primate model of Parkinson's disease.

Hand, mouth and eye preferences in the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).

Hook-Costigan MA(1), Rogers LJ.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Physiology, University of New England, Armidale, N.S.W.,
Australia.

Motor and sensory preferences were measured for 8 common marmosets (Callithrix
jacchus). Three types of motor function were examined: spontaneous feeding, mouth
use when chewing and visuospatial reaching. Eye preference was used as an index
of sensory lateralization. The marmosets displayed individual preferences for the
performance of the motor tasks, but no group biases were revealed. Correlations
between preferences displayed on the motor tests suggest that one hemisphere may 
control spontaneous feeding and lateralized mouth use while the other controls
visuospatial reaching, but no consistent preference was present. In an eye
preference test, 7 subjects displayed right-eye preferences, suggesting
hemispheric specialisation for this function.

Comparative study of oestrogen excretion in female New World Monkeys: an overview
of non-invasive ovarian monitoring and a new application in evolutionary biology.

(1)Anthropologisches Institut, Universität Zürich-Irchel, Schweiz.

Oestrogen was measured in urine samples collected from captive females
representing 7 species of New World monkey to provide an overview of the
applicability of such formation in the noninvasive monitoring of ovarian function
and to assess the potential applicability of such information in phylogenetic
studies. Species available for study were the pygmy marmoset, common marmoset,
red-bellied tamarin, cotton-top tamarin, golden lion tamarin, Goeldi's monkey and
the owl monkey. Oestrone conjugates were measured in serially collected urine
samples to demonstrate ovarian cyclicity. Urine samples obtained during the
luteal phase were subjected to HPLC to identify immunoreactive oestrogens;
oestrone and oestradiol-17 beta accounted for almost all of the immunoreactive
oestrogen detected while oestriol content was negligible. Urine samples obtained 
during the follicular phase and luteal phase were subjected to glucuronidase
hydrolysis, sulphatase hydrolysis and acid solvolysis, which revealed that the
major immunoreactive oestrogen metabolite was: (1) oestradiol sulphate in the
pygmy marmoset and common marmoset, (2) residual oestradiol in the red-bellied
tamarin, (3) residual oestradiol and oestrone glucuronide in the cotton-top
tamarin, and (4) oestrone glucuronide in the golden lion tamarin, Goeldi's monkey
and owl monkey. A phylogenetic tree based on the above shifts in oestrogen
excretion suggested that clawed New World monkeys are specialized and that the
lineages leading to the study species split off in the following order: Goeldi's 
monkey, golden lion tamarin, cotton-top tamarin, red-bellied tamarin, common
marmoset and pygmy marmoset.

Behavioral and neurochemical consequences of ibotenic acid lesion in the
subthalamic nucleus of the common marmoset.

Andrén PE(1), Levin ED, Liminga U, Gunne L.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Psychiatry at Ulleråker, Uppsala University, Sweden.

Five marmosets were unilaterally lesioned within the subthalamic nucleus (STN) by
injection of 10 micrograms ibotenic acid. Seven marmosets served as saline
injected controls. The lesioned marmosets showed an increased locomotor activity,
occasional tongue protrusions, posture asymmetry, and abnormal movements of the
contralateral legs and arms. The animals were sacrificed 21 days after the
ibotenic acid injection and markers of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), dopamine
(DA), and acetylcholine were studied in a variety brain regions. There was a
bilateral increase in the activity of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) in the
caudate, putamen, globus pallidus, superior colliculus, and the ventral
anterior/ventral lateral (VA/VL) thalamus, whereas GABA concentrations were only 
increased ipsilaterally in the ventral posterior
medial/centromedial/parafasciculus (VPM/CM/Pf) complex of the thalamus. Tyrosine 
hydroxylase (TH) activity was bilaterally increased in the medial segment of
globus pallidus and nucleus accumbens. However, there were also changes
restricted to the side contralateral to the lesion. TH activity and DA
concentrations were increased contralateral to the lesion in the putamen. Choline
acetyltransferase (CAT) activity was bilaterally increased in the medial segment 
of globus pallidus and hypothalamus. The ibotenic acid induced STN-lesion in the 
marmoset, thus, seemed to cause a widespread bilateral activation of neurons
within the basal ganglia.

The effect of parturition on the interactions within pairs of common marmosets
(Callithrix jacchus).

The relationship within common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) pairs is based on
pair-bond formation. This pair-bond is important for the successful rearing of
the young and for the enhancement of reproductive success. Female marmosets bear 
twins which are carried mainly by males starting on the first day after the birth
of the infants. Little is known, however, about the patterns of sociosexual
interaction between callitrichid pairs and how these interactions change after
the arrival of offspring. To evaluate the effect of parturition on these
interactions, three heterosexual pairs of common marmosets were observed for four
weeks before and four weeks after the birth of infants. The animals were kept in 
individual outdoor cages of the Nucleo de Primatologia, under environmental
conditions. The time spent in proximity was mainly attributable to the initiative
of females before parturition and the initiative of males after the offspring
arrived. Males were groomed more before than after the birth of infants. In
contrast, the amount of grooming received by females was the same in the two
situations. These observations suggest that the relationship within pairs of
common marmosets is slightly modified by the birth of infants and indicates that 
males and females could be using different strategies to enhance their
reproductive success.

Anatomy of adult female common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) reproductive system.

of Adelaide, Australia.

Better appreciation of the female reproductive anatomy of the common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus) should improve the prospects for nonsurgical embryo transfer
in this model. Vaginal measurements were performed in 8 female adult marmoset
monkeys. Four monkeys were measured at laparotomy for gross internal anatomy, and
1 monkey was analysed at autopsy. The vagina of the marmoset monkey was found to 
be divided into a lower and upper vagina with a marked vaginal isthmus between
them. The mean lengths of the lower and upper vagina were 17 mm (34 mm in total
vagina). The mean uterine size was 8.4 (length) x 10.0 (width) x 6.4 (thickness) 
mm, with the ovary measuring 5.3 x 4.3 x 3.8 mm. The mean length of the fallopian
tube was 10.5 mm with a width of 1.5 mm. Nonsurgical embryo transfer in this
model appears to be feasible, but the proportionally long vagina and short
uterine cavity needs to be recognised.

Molecular mass and isoelectric properties of pituitary and urinary gonadotrophins
in callitrichid primates.

Rosenbusch J(1), Bellmann A, Hodges JK.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Reproductive Biology, German Primate Centre, Göttingen.

In this study, the molecular masses and isoelectric characteristics of pituitary 
LH and FSH in two species of callitrichid primate, the common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus) and the cotton-top tamarin (Saguinus oedipus), were
determined. Comparative data for urine samples from Callithrix jacchus are also
presented. The separation of gonadotrophins from pituitary extracts and urine was
performed under nonreducing conditions using SDS-PAGE and isoelectric focusing
procedures. Hormone activity in gel eluates was determined by in vitro bioassays 
for LH and FSH and by a microtitre plate enzymeimmunoassay for LH. The molecular 
masses of pituitary and urinary proteins were between 36 and 37 kDa for LH and
FSH, and were similar in both species. A dimer form of pituitary LH with a
molecular mass of 33 kDa was also found in the cotton-top tamarin, but not in the
marmoset. Guanidine-HCl dissociation of gonadotrophins from marmoset and tamarin 
pituitaries before electrophoresis gave proteins of 16 and 28 kDa, and 16 and 25 
kDa range, respectively. Isoelectric focusing revealed numerous peaks of
bioactivity for both LH and FSH, indicating the presence of multiple molecular
variants (isoforms) of each hormone. In both species pituitary FSH eluted over a 
narrower and more acidic pH range than LH. Isoelectric focusing profiles for
pituitary and urinary LH in the marmoset were similar (pH range 5.0-8.5), whereas
urinary FSH demonstrated a more acidic profile than the pituitary protein. These 
results give comparative information on the properties of New World primate
gonadotrophins, which should be useful in studies of their physiological action
and in aiding the development of improved reagents and assays for their
detection.

Effects of bifemelane on parkinsonism induced by

The effects of bifemelane on parkinsonism were shown in MPTP-treated common
marmosets. The administration of bifemelane increased locomotor activity in
MPTP-treated marmosets but not in normal control marmosets. In a microdialysis
study, extracellular levels of dopamine and its metabolites increased following
the administration of bifemelane. These results indicate that it is worth
studying the effects of bifemelane hydrochloride on patients with Parkinson's
disease.

3H11, a unique cell surface molecule involved in the function of the CD45RA+
subset of CD4+ cells.

Boston, MA 02115.

We have developed a mAb anti-3H11 by immunizing mice with a T cell line derived
from the Callithrix jacchus (common marmoset). Anti-3H11 is reactive with
approximately 48% of unfractionated T cells, 62% of CD4+ cells and 39% of CD8+
cells. Among CD4 cells, anti-3H11 preferentially reacts with the CD45RA+ T cell
subset. The majority of helper activity for pokeweed mitogen (PWM)-driven B cell 
IgG synthesis and T cell response to recall antigen such as tetanus toxoid was
found within the 3H11-CD4 cell population, whereas anti-3H11+CD4+ cells provided 
poor helper function for PWM-driven B cell IgG synthesis and were more responsive
to concanavalin A and autologous mixed lymphocyte reaction. Biochemical
characterization showed that anti-3H11 precipitated a single protein band with a 
relative molecular weight of 32,000 from 125I-surface labeled cell lysate.
Biochemical, phenotypic and functional studies revealed that the 3H11 molecule
appeared to be different from previously established molecules on the T cell
surface. Interestingly, addition of anti-3H11 to the combination of CD4 and B
cells in the presence of CD8 cells but not to the combination of CD4 and B cells 
resulted in enhancement of the suppression of PWM-driven B cell IgG synthesis.
Moreover, anti-3H11 had a co-mitogenic effect on T cells via the CD2 and CD3
pathways, and this co-mitogenic activity is restricted to the CD45RA+ T cells.
Taken together, our results show that the 3H11 molecule is a novel antigen which 
may play an important role in the activation and function of the CD45RA+ subset
of T cells.

Nonsurgical uterine stage preimplantation embryo collection from the common
marmoset.

A nonsurgical technique for the recovery of uterine stage preimplantation embryos
was developed for the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). In 54 flush attempts,
using 19 different animals, 54 morphologically normal embryos, seven unfertilized
oocytes or degenerate embryos, and five empty zonae pellucidae were recovered,
giving a recovery rate of 1.0 embryo per flush or 1.2 ovulation products per
flush. Because the ovarian cycles of common marmosets can be synchronized with
prostaglandin PGF2 alpha, multiple marmosets can be flushed in a short period,
providing age-matched embryos for controlled experiments.

representatives of the classes Mammalia, Aves and Amphibia.

As part of a wider study on the molecular evolution of alanine:glyoxylate
aminotransferase 1 (AGT1) intracellular compartmentalization, we have determined 
the subcellular distribution of immunoreactive AGT1, using postembedding protein 
A-gold immunoelectron microscopy, in the livers of various members of the classes
Mammalia, Aves, and Amphibia. As far as organellar distribution is concerned,
three categories could be distinguished. In members of the first category (type
I), all, or nearly all, of the immunoreactive AGT1 was concentrated within the
peroxisomes. In the second category (type II), AGT1 was found more evenly
distributed in both peroxisomes and mitochondria. In the third category (type
III), AGT1 was localized mainly within the mitochondria with much lower, but
widely variable, amounts in the peroxisomes. Type I animals include the human,
two great apes (gorilla, orangutan), two Old World monkeys (anubis baboon,
Japanese macaque), a New World monkey (white-faced Saki monkey), a lago, morph
(European rabbit), a bat (Seba's short-tailed fruit bat), two caviomorph rodents 
(guinea pig, orange-rumped agouti), and two Australian marsupials (koala,
Bennett's wallaby). Type II animals include two New World monkeys (common
marmoset, cotton-top tamarin), three prosimians (brown lemur, fat-tailed dwarf
lemur, pygmy slow loris), five rodents (a hybrid crested porcupine, Colombian
ground squirrel, laboratory rat, laboratory mouse, golden hamster), an American
marsupial (grey short-tailed opossum), and a bird (raven). Type III animals
include the large tree shrew, three insectivores (common Eurasian mole, European 
hedgehog, house shrew), four carnivores (domestic cat, ocelot, domestic dog,
polecat ferret), and an amphibian (common frog). In addition to these categories,
some animals (e.g. guinea pig, common frog) possessed significant amounts of
cytosolic AGT1. Whereas the subcellular distribution of AGT1 in some orders (e.g.
Insectivora and Carnivora) did not appear to vary markedly between the different 
members, in other orders (e.g. Primates, Rodentia and Marsupialia) it fluctuated 
widely between the different species. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that the
subcellular distribution of AGT1 has changed radically on numerous occasions
during the evolution of mammals. The new observations presented in this paper are
compatible with our previous demonstration of a relationship between AGT1
subcellular distribution and either present or putative ancestral dietary habit, 
and our previous suggestion that the molecular evolution of the AGT gene has been
markedly influenced by dietary selection pressure.

Spontaneous adrenal and hepatic myelolipomas in the common marmoset.

Kakinuma C(1), Harada T, Watanabe M, Shibutani Y.

Author information: 
(1)Toxicology Laboratory, Mochida Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Shizuoka, Japan.

Myelolipomas occurring simultaneously in the adrenal and liver were found in a
2.7-yr-old, bred female common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). The animal bore
single adrenal and multiple hepatic myelolipomas. The adrenal myelolipoma
consisted of mature adipose cells and focal collections of normal hematopoietic
elements and was unencapsulated. In the liver, the myelolipomas, which were
partially encapsulated, included a large amount of hematopoietic tissue and
adipose cells that resembled normal bone marrow cells in various ways.
Additionally, one of the multiple nodules contained several bony spicules with
osteoblasts. Furthermore, there were invasive figures of hematopoietic cells,
such as myeloblasts, erythroblasts, and megakaryocytes, in the hepatic sinusoids 
around the lesions. Thus, this case has some unusual morphological
characteristics and is the first report, to our knowledge, on multiorganic
myelolipomas in common marmosets.

Mitochondrial abnormalities in nigral neurons of the marmoset and Macaca
fascicularis treated with MPTP.

Italy.

In a previous study we observed the processes determining the cellular death in
nigral neurons of Macaca fascicularis and common Marmoset treated with MPTP. The 
purpose of this study is to consider, in substantia nigra neurons of the same
animals, mitochondrial abnormalities caused by neurotoxin. Three Macaca
fascicularis and 5 common Marmosets, respectively treated with 3 and 4 mg/kg of
MPTP dissolved in saline + 10% ethanol, were suppressed by means of an i.v.
injection phenobarbital. The substantia nigra, isolated from the mesencephalon,
has been examined under Electron Microscope. Different mitochondrial
abnormalities have been observed in nigral neurons: crystal abnormalities occur
more frequently than other alterations. They are correlated with various degrees 
of mitochondrial enlargement. Dissolution of the matrix induces formation of
spherical highly electron-dense inclusions of various volume and in different
number; they are probably lipoprotein. Laminar bodies and myelin-like figures are
determined by alterations of the external membrane. Particular roundish
organules, placed near normal mitochondria, are limited by fragments of membrane 
with a granular material, occasionally flowing in the cytoplasm. The biochemical 
hypothesis concerning the genesis of the observed abnormalities is discussed in
the present study.

Oxytocin gene expression and oxytocin immunoactivity in the ovary of the common
marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus).

Einspanier A(1), Ivell R, Rune G, Hodges JK.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Reproductive Biology, German Primate Centre, Göttingen.

Oxytocin was identified in ovaries recovered on Day 5 (+/- 1) of the luteal phase
from three female marmoset monkeys (Callithrix jacchus). With use of a reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay, expression of mRNA for oxytocin
and oxytocin receptor was detected in both luteal tissue and in the ovarian
remnant. Evidence for ovarian synthesis of oxytocin was provided by
immunohistochemistry, which showed positive staining for oxytocin and neurophysin
in the cytoplasm of the luteal cells. Some luteal cells had a more intensely
stained perinuclear region than others for oxytocin immunoreactivity, whereas the
staining for neurophysin was evenly distributed. Granulosa and theca cells of
antral follicles also showed positive staining for oxytocin immunoreactivity; no 
reactivity was found in fibroblast or endothelial cells. Oxytocin
immunoreactivity was also detected in the luteal tissue of all animals by
immunoassay, with values ranging from 2.8 to 12.1 ng/g wet weight. The oxytocin
concentration for the ovarian remnant was either very low (0.55-0.75 ng/g wet
weight) or nondetectable (< 0.5 ng/g wet weight). Local production of oxytocin
within the ovary was suggested by the measurement of higher oxytocin
concentrations in the blood from ovaries containing corpora lutea compared with
peripheral blood. Collectively, these results provide evidence for ovarian
biosynthesis of oxytocin and suggest the possibility of a paracrine role in the
regulation of primate ovarian function.

1. GR95030X, a potent inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A
(HMG-CoA) reductase, was administered daily to marmosets by gavage. In a Maximum 
Repeatable Dose (MRD) study, doses of up to 30 mg kg-1 day-1 were administered
for 49 days. In a chronic study, animals received dosages equivalent to 0, 1,
2.5, 7.5 and 20 mg kg-1 day-1 for 204 or 205 days. Some animals were maintained
without treatment for a recovery period of 29 or 30 days. 2. Clinical signs
included poor coat condition, weakness with impaired coordination, lethargy and
other behavioural changes. There was also alimentary disturbance, and some deaths
occurred at doses of 20 mg kg-1 day-1 and above. 3. Adverse effects upon body
weight were seen although some recovery was apparent after the cessation of
treatment. 4. Serum cholesterol concentrations were reduced. Very large increases
in serum ALT, AST and CK activities were recorded with CK-MM isoenzymes
accounting for 80% or more of the total CK enzyme activity. 5. Treatment was
associated with muscle fibre atrophy and a sarcolemmal response with little
evidence of regeneration. Histological examination revealed vascular changes,
glial proliferation and cell death in the brain, with no consistent distribution.
Alveolar capillary congestion and alveolar proteinosis indicated that there may
have been a reduction in cardiac function. 6. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have
evident potential to cause myopathy in marmosets. This is believed to be the
first report of such an effect.

[Hypotensive action of human renin inhibitor KRI-1314 in the common marmoset].

[Article in Japanese]

Saitoh H(1), Etoh Y, Murakami M, Kubota T, Miyazaki M.

(1)Department of Pharmacology, Osaka Medical College, Japan.

The possibility of using KRI-1314, a new cyclohexylnorstatine derivative, as an
antihypertensive drug was examined using common marmosets. KRI-1314 strongly
inhibited plasma renin activity (PRA) in both humans and marmosets, with a 50%
inhibitory concentration of 4.7 x 10(-9) and 6.9 x 10(-9) M, respectively. In
anesthetized marmosets, the increase in both blood pressure and PRA induced by
bolus intravenous injection of RH-renin (0.15 microgram/kg) was suppressed by
constant intravenous infusion of KRI-1314 (0.01 and 0.1 mg/kg/min) in a
dose-dependent manner. In the sustained hypertension induced by continuous
intravenous infusion of RH-renin (0.1 microgram/kg/min), a dose-dependent
hypotensive response was produced by bolus intravenous injection of KRI-1314
(0.03-3 mg/kg). In the sodium-depleted model, whose PRA was increased by a
two-week low-sodium diet coupled with furosemide loading, both intravenous
injection (0.1-3 mg/kg) and oral administration (10 and 30 mg/kg) of KRI-1314 to 
anesthetized and conscious animals, respectively, lowered blood pressure
dose-dependently with PRA suppression. The hypotensive activity of orally
administered KRI-1314 (30 mg/kg) was almost equal to that of orally administered 
captopril (1 mg/kg). KRI-1314 did not affect heart rate in any of the
experiments. These results indicate that the potent human renin inhibitor
KRI-1314 may become an orally effective drug for treating renin-dependent
hypertension.

Embryotoxic effects of thalidomide derivatives in the non-human primate
Callithrix jacchus. 5. Lack of teratogenic effects of phthalimidophthalmide.

Toxikologie und Embryopharmakologie, Germany.

The teratogenic potency of the thalidomide (Thd) derivative
phthalimidophthalimide (Phtpht) was assessed in the common marmoset (Callithrix
jacchus), by oral administration of the relatively high daily dose of 50 mg
Phtpht/kg body wt, during the susceptible period (days 48-61 of pregnancy). Since
in this species daily doses of only 100 micrograms/kg body wt of the Thd
derivative EM12 already induce typical gross structural abnormalities in nearly
100% of the fetuses, investigations with a small number of these New World
monkeys allow a rough estimation of the teratogenic potency of Thd-type
substances. Macroscopic inspection and skeletal evaluation of ten fetuses gave no
indication of dysmorphogenesis following treatment with Phtpht. We conclude that 
Phtpht has little, if any, Thd-type teratogenic potency in this non-human
primate.

enantiomers.

Virchow, Freie Universität Berlin, Germany.

The dose-response of the teratogenic potency of the thalidomide (Thd) derivative 
EM12 was evaluated in the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). The smallest
daily dose found to be effective was 30 micrograms EM12/kg body wt. This is the
lowest dose of a Thd derivative ever reported to induce severe skeletal
abnormalities. Ten micrograms EM12/kg body wt may be considered the
no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) under the experimental conditions
chosen. The teratogenic potencies of the two EM12 enantiomers were tested at 100 
micrograms/kg body wt, the dose which just induces an almost 100% effect in the
case of the racemate. The S(-)-EM12 was found to induce typical severe limb
abnormalities such as amelia, phocomelia, and radius aplasia, and none of the
exposed fetuses were devoid of skeletal defects. In contrast, only few and minor 
skeletal defects were observed after application of the R(+) enantiomer. Although
a pronounced teratogenic potency of the R(+)-EM12 can now largely be excluded,
these low-dose studies are not sufficient to completely rule out any teratogenic 
potential of this enantiomer, since racemisation to small amounts of the S(-)
form may occur in vivo. Further studies with Thd derivatives which are unable to 
racemise are necessary to prove the assumed complete ineffectiveness of the R(+) 
enantiomers.

The regulation of maternal behaviour in marmosets and tamarins.

Pryce CR(1).

Author information: 
(1)Anthropologisches Institut, Universität Zürich-Irchel, Zürich, Switzerland.

This article reviews a long-term investigation into the roles of (1) experience
obtained with infants during development and postnatally, and (2) levels of
reproductive-steroid hormones during late pregnancy, in the regulation of
maternal caregiving motivation and behaviour in the red-bellied tamarin (Saguinus
labiatus) and the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) (family Callitrichidae,
Order Primates). Both observational studies, e.g. post hoc analysis of the
relationship between developmental caregiving experience and infant-rearing
success, and manipulative studies, e.g. direct analysis of the effects of
sex-steroid administration on maternal motivation, were performed. In red-bellied
tamarins, a breeding female's infant-rearing success was related to its
caregiving experience obtained during development and postpartum/postnatally. In 
multiparous females lacking developmental caregiving experience, postpartum
maternal caregiving behaviour and infant-rearing success were related to
prepartum urinary oestradiol levels. In nulliparous common marmosets, caregiving 
of infant-siblings increased as a consequence of physical interaction with
parent-infant dyads, late pregnancy, and exposure to late pregnancy-like levels
of progesterone and oestradiol. The evidence for a dual mechanism of endocrine
and experiential regulation of caregiving in these monkeys is discussed in terms 
its evolution and function.

(1)Department of Physiology, Freie Universität, Berlin, Germany.

Monosynaptic projections from the cerebral cortex to the vestibular nuclei were
studied in the common marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus) by injecting
fluorescent dextrans into the brain stem vestibular nuclei. The injection sites
were determined by single unit vestibular responses identified later
histologically. During the recordings sinewave rotation in pitch, roll or yaw or 
steady tilt was applied. The most notable loci of labelling were found inside the
primary sensory cortex, the cortex deep down along the posterior lateral sulcus, 
the premotor region and the anterior cingulate cortex. From studies in other
primates these cortical areas are known to process vestibular information. Their 
connections with the vestibular nuclei may serve as an internal feedback
modulating the vestibular brain stem activity.

and M2 receptors) and serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine1 receptor) are analysed in
the primary visual cortex (area 17) of the common marmoset, Callithrix jacchus,
using quantitative autoradiography. All binding sites show a well-defined laminar
pattern, which changes sharply at the cytoarchitectonic border to area 18. The
quantitative data show that the distribution of different receptors is relatively
invariant across the cortical layers. Almost all receptors show a maximum in
supragranular layers, low densities in layers IVA/IVB and a second maximum in
layer IVC. Statistical analysis of these similarities in laminar distribution
patterns of different receptors (co-distribution) reveals, as in other brain
regions and species, that L-glutamate binding sites are co-distributed with
N-methyl-D-aspartate, GABAA, and muscarinic M1 and M2 receptors. This may reflect
the structural basis of a possible interaction between these receptors and their 
respective transmitters on the level of single cortical layers. Further
co-distributions are found between N-methyl-D-aspartate, GABAA and M1, as well as
between alpha 1 and M1 and finally between M1 and M2 receptors. Since not all
receptors are co-distributed, the similarities in laminar patterns reveal
specific aspects of the neurochemical organization of the cortex when receptors
of different transmitter systems are analysed in the same brain.(ABSTRACT

Behavioral effects of cholinergic grafts.

Ridley RM(1), Baker HF.

Author information:

United Kingdom.

Experimental work in animals and, to a more limited extent, in humans, has
demonstrated that the cholinergic system is involved in mechanisms which control 
learning and memory. Since there is cholinergic loss in a variety of dementing
illnesses, any treatment designed to alleviate the mental symptoms of these
diseases must address the issue of cholinergic dysfunction even if other
treatments are also required to overcome other neurotransmitter imbalances. Work 
in rodents has demonstrated that cholinergic-rich fetal neural tissue transplants
can, under certain circumstances, alleviate the behavioral effects of cholinergic
lesions or of cholinergic decline associated with aging. More complex cognitive
testing can be achieved using primates and, in this case, the common marmoset is 
a suitable species to use because its rapid and reliable reproductive rate aids
the provision of appropriate transplant tissue. Marmosets with transection of the
fornix are deprived of a cholinergic input into the dentate gyrus, posterior
hippocampus and entorhinal cortex and are specifically impaired on learning tasks
which require remembering a rule of responding (non-evaluative memory).
Transplantation of cholinergic-rich fetal septal tissue into the hippocampus of
such animals completely restores their ability to learn this type of task,
whereas transplantation of cholinergic-poor fetal hippocampal tissue into the
same area produces no such improvements. These results demonstrate that where a
learning impairment is produced by a relatively simple procedure which has a
major effect on one neurotransmitter, that function can be restored by
transplantation of tissue containing that neurotransmitter even where the
impairment consists of a very "high level" cognitive dysfunction.

Behavioral effects of the intraventricular administration of 5-HT and dopamine in
the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).

Oliveira Mda P(1), Campos Mde F.

Author information:

Natal, RN, Brasil.

The effects of IVT serotonin [5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)] and dopamine (DA)
administration have been studied in rats and marmosets (Callithrix jacchus). In
rats, 5-HT (114 and 170 micrograms/10 microliters) produced the same behavioral
effects observed after IP administration of its precursors and agonists. The same
doses of 5-HT used for rats produced only part of the behavioral effects in
marmosets after IP administration of 5-HT precursors and agonists. Ataxia,
vomiting, and decreased motor activity were observed, but not drowsiness or
teeth-chattering. However, IVT administration of DA (400 micrograms/10
microliters dose) produced head movements or checking, ataxia, tongue out, and
decreased motor activity. These findings differ from those observed after IP
administration of l-DOPA and DA agonists, which increase motor activity.

The behavioural, biochemical and morphological effects of a chronic
administration of low doses of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine
(MPTP) were studied in the common marmoset. Monkeys received the toxin (1 mg/kg
i.p.) twice a week for four months. Group A monkeys were studied one week after
the last injection of MPTP; group B monkeys were studied eight months after the
last toxic injection. The monkey behaviour was observed throughout the
experiment; the biochemical and morphological correlates were studied post mortem
in the neostriatum and in the substantia nigra, respectively. Data collected from
MPTP-treated marmosets were compared to those obtained from sham-injected control
monkeys. The results can be summarized as follows. (1) In all MPTP-treated
marmosets a progressive Parkinsonism occurred. In group B monkeys, a gradual
behavioural recovery was observed after MPTP was discontinued. (2) Biochemical
analysis of group A marmosets showed a depletion of dopamine, of
3,4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid and of homovanillic acid, and no variations in
dopamine turnover in the neostriatum of MPTP-treated marmosets. In group B,
biochemical analysis showed no differences between controls and MPTP-treated
animals. (3) Morphological analysis showed that the density of midbrain
dopaminergic neurons located in the substantia nigra was unchanged in group A
monkeys, but was reduced by 6.8% in MPTP-treated monkeys of group B. The
measurement of cross-sectional area showed that midbrain dopaminergic neurons
were swollen in MPTP-treated monkeys of group A, with a 11.0% increase of cell
size as compared to controls. In group A the nuclei were also swollen, being
304.8% larger in MPTP-treated monkeys, with a nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio of 65.9%
(as compared to 34.0% of controls). In group B monkeys cell size was increased by
18.4% in MPTP-treated marmosets, but the nuclei were of comparable size. The
present data show that a chronic administration of low doses of MPTP brings about
biochemical and morphological abnormalities. The first occur acutely in terminals
and are reverted early after discontinuance of exposure to the toxin; the latter 
occur in dopaminergic perikarya, last longer than biochemical abnormalities and, 
at variance with them, increase in severity after MPTP is discontinued.
Morphological abnormalities include early events, such as a transient swelling of
nuclei or a long-lasting swelling of neurons, and late events, such as a decrease
in the number of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive perikarya.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT

Pre- and postnatal development of the primary visual cortex of the common
marmoset. II. Formation, remodelling, and elimination of synapses as overlapping 
processes.

Missler M(1), Wolff A, Merker HJ, Wolff JR.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Anatomy, University of Göttingen, Germany.

During ontogenesis changes in the numerical density of synapses are usually
assumed to depend essentially on variations in the formation of synapses. Only
the final adjustment to adult synapse densities is thought to include the
elimination of synapses in some brain regions of certain species. Here, we focus 
attention on quantitative aspects of synapse elimination throughout development
of area 17 of marmoset monkeys (Callithrix jacchus). Mature synapses, various
precursor forms, and indicators of lysosomal degradation of synapses were
quantitatively analysed by electron microscopy and morphometric methods. A total 
number of about 135 x 10(9) synapses was calculated for area 17 in each adult
hemisphere corresponding to a volume density of 600 x 10(6) synapses/mm3. At 3
months of age, the respective values were 508 x 10(9)/area and 1,159 x 10(6)/mm3,
while at birth these values were 69 x 10(9)/area and 328 x 10(6)/mm3.
Consequently, at least three out of four synapses are eliminated between 3 months
and adulthood. However, the real number of synapses being eliminated during
development is probably much larger if the time course of lysosomal degradation
is additionally taken into account. The frequency of lysosomes in presynaptic
endings is highest before net-elimination of synapses occurs, i.e., between 1 and
3 months. This suggests that lysosomal degradation is not directly responsible
for the majority of synapses removed during ontogenesis but apparently represents
a second mechanism for synapse remodelling and elimination. Thus, it appears from
this study that remodelling and elimination of synapses are quantitatively as
important as their formation, and accompany synaptogenesis from its very onset
onwards.

Pre- and postnatal development of the primary visual cortex of the common
marmoset. I. A changing space for synaptogenesis.

Missler M(1), Eins S, Merker HJ, Rothe H, Wolff JR.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Anatomy, University of Göttingen, Germany.

The primary visual cortex of Callithrix jacchus occupies a large portion of the
occipital neocortex and can be safely delineated from fetal stages onwards. In 20
animals ranging in age from fetal to adult age the morphological development of
area 17 was evaluated and compared with the growth of whole brain, skull, and
head size. Cortical thickness, surface area, and volume of the area were
determined in addition to predominant growth directions. The volume of area 17
approximately doubles between birth (241 mm3) and three months of age (506 mm3). 
This maximum value marks an overshoot in growth (volume: 180%, surface area:
150%, thickness: 122%), which is followed by a considerable reduction before
adult values (100%) are reached. Although these values seem to indicate that the 
overall reduction in size is fairly isometric, growth and regression are locally 
anisometric. For example, layers II-IVc contribute disproportionately to the
overshoot; thickening is less pronounced than tangential growth and follows a
slightly different time course. These data suggest that the developing visual
cortex represents a highly dynamic distribution space for the developing synaptic
junctions which should be taken into account in studies on synaptogenesis. By
comparison it is suggested that this growth dynamic is not restricted to area 17 
but also occurs in some other parts of the cerebral cortex. In contrast, most
subcortical brain regions apparently do not undergo overshoot growth. Structural 
changes of the skull compensate the overshoot in cortex growth, so that head size
increases steadily.

Ocular development and visual deprivation myopia in the common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus).

Troilo D(1), Judge SJ.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Psychology, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853.

The normal postnatal ocular development of the common marmoset (Callithrix
jacchus) and the effects of visual deprivation on eye growth and refractive state
are described. The marmoset normally undergoes a developmental process of
emmetropization from high hyperopia at birth. This emmetropization is easily
disrupted by visual deprivation produced by lid-suture. Myopia and axial
elongation of the vitreous chamber are induced by visual deprivations of 12, 5,
and 3 weeks duration. The development of axial myopia after 3 weeks of visual
deprivation differs from longer duration deprivations in that the experimental
eyes are initially shorter than normal and hyperopic at the end of the visual
deprivation period, but subsequently become longer than normal and myopic. Visual
deprivation myopia in the marmoset persists even after the deprivation is
discontinued and a visual signal is restored. In all experimental groups, the
development of the eye in response to the cessation of visual deprivation shows
no slowing of vitreous chamber enlargement; the axial enlargement relative to the
control eye is either maintained or increases and produces significantly greater 
myopia. These results suggest that the visual control of postnatal eye growth in 
the marmoset may be unidirectional in its response to visual experience and able 
only to increase the growth rate of the vitreous chamber, possibly after an
initial delay.

Visual optics and retinal cone topography in the common marmoset (Callithrix
jacchus).

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a small, diurnal, New World monkey
amenable to vision research. In this paper we describe the visual optics and cone
photoreceptor topography of the normal adult marmoset. Paraxial optical
ray-tracing shows that the marmoset eye is well represented as a scaled-down
version of the human eye. The density of foveal and perifoveal cone
photoreceptors in the marmoset is as high, and in peripheral retina higher, than 
those reported in humans and macaques. The foveal acuity predicted by the Nyquist
limits set by the cone mosaic (30 c/deg) is in agreement with behavioral measures
of visual acuity. Foveal depth of focus is remarkably small (< 0.2 D) for an eye 
of this size (axial length about 11 mm). Estimates of the amplitude of
accommodation using infrared photorefraction indicate that the marmoset is
capable of more than 20 D of accommodation.

Alterations in striatal and extrastriatal D-1 and D-2 dopamine receptors in the

College, United Kingdom.

In adult common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus), MPTP
(1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) treatment induced almost total
depletion of cells in the substantia nigra pars compacts (SNc) but partial cell
loss in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). There was severe depletion of
[3H]-mazindol binding to dopamine (DA) uptake sites in the caudate, putamen, and 
SNc. The loss of [3H]-mazindol binding in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and
olfactory tubercle (OT) was less marked. [3H]-mazindol binding in the body of
caudate nucleus showed a small but significant recovery with increasing
post-lesion survival times. The specific binding of [3H]-SCH 23390 to D-1 DA
receptor sites was increased after MPTP treatment in all subregions of both
caudate and putamen but was unaltered in the NAc and OT. Substantia nigra pars
reticulata (SNr), frontal cortex, and medial segment of globus pallidus (GPm) all
demonstrated moderate levels of [3H]-SCH 23390 binding in control animals, which 
were unaffected by MPTP treatment. Specific [3H]-spiperone binding to D-2 DA
receptor sites was not altered by MPTP treatment in the subregions of
caudate-putamen. Moderate levels of [3H]-spiperone binding were observed in
control animals in the NAc, OT, SNc, and the lateral segment of globus pallidus
(GP1). [3H]-spiperone binding in the SNc and OT was partially decreased in
MPTP-treated animals. The changes in specific [3H]-spiperone and [3H]-SCH 23390
binding induced by MPTP-treatment did not alter with post-lesion survival times. 
These results demonstrate that MPTP treatment causes greater dopaminergic
denervation of the caudate-putamen than in NAc/OT. This resulted in an increase
in postsynaptic D-1 DA receptor sites in the caudate-putamen but not in the
NAc/OT. Also, there appeared to be loss of presynaptic D-2 DA receptor sites in
the SNc and OT. In the caudate-putamen, the loss of presynaptic D-2 DA receptor
sites may have masked postsynaptic D-2 DA receptor upregulation.

Alteration of circadian period length does not influence the ovarian cycle length
in common marmosets, Callithrix j. jacchus (primates).

Härter L(1), Erkert HG.

Author information: 
(1)Zoologisches Institut/Tierphysiologie, Universität Tübingen, Germany.

To investigate the coupling between the circadian system and the regulation of
the ovarian cycle in nonhuman primates, the effect of Zeitgeber-induced
alterations of the circadian period (23 vs 26 h) on the ovarian cycle length was 
studied in the long-cycling polyestrous common marmoset, Callithrix j. jacchus.
For that purpose, six female marmosets were isolated for approximately 4 months
each under artificial lighting regimens of 23 h [light-dark (LD) 11.5:11.5] and
of 26 h (LD 13:13; 300:0.03 lx). Samples of "morning urine" were collected in
each circadian period and analyzed by radioimmunoassay for their estrone (E1) and
estradiol-17 beta (E2) concentrations. Clear ovarian cyclic variations of the
creatinine related urinary E1 and E2 concentrations were ascertained in each
individual, with the E2 concentrations being 5-10 times higher than the E1
concentrations. In a total of 48 recorded ovarian cycles, the cycle length varied
between 16 and 39 days and was 28.3 +/- 4.1 days on average. As measured in
circadian periods, the marmosets' ovarian cycle was significantly longer (p <
0.05) under entrainment to LD 11.5:11.5 than under entrainment to LD 13:13. When 
measured in objective days, however, no difference in cycle length was
demonstrated. Hence, in Callithrix, the mechanisms regulating the ovarian cycle
length do not seem to be closely coupled to the circadian system, but rather
corroborate the more classic hypothesis presuming that in polyestrous mammals
different (at most weakly coupled) timing mechanisms or oscillator systems are
responsible for the regulation of the circadian and the ovarian cycles.

The respective roles of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and c-myc in the pathogenesis of
endemic Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) are unclear. In order to help resolve the
question whether constitutive expression of the c-myc gene in an EBV-immortalised
B cell is sufficient to induce a tumorigenic phenotype, B cells from a common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) were immortalised with EBV, transfected with a
constitutively activated c-myc gene and inoculated into the host animals. Despite
the cell line transfected with c-myc displaying enhanced growth characteristics, 
in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that this was not sufficient to
induce a tumorigenic phenotype. This supports our previous findings with
EBV-immortalised human B cells transfected with an activated c-myc gene (Hotchin 
et al., 1990).

A selective MAOB inhibitor Ro19-6327 potentiates the effects of levodopa on
parkinsonism induced by MPTP in the common marmoset.

Nomoto M(1), Fukuda T.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pharmacology, Kagoshima University School of Medicine, Japan.

The effects of the selective and reversible MAOB inhibitor Ro19-6327 on
parkinsonism in common marmosets, induced by MPTP were studied. Combined
administration of Ro19-6327 with benserazide/levodopa potentiated the effects of 
levodopa to reverse akinesia. In a microdialysis study, the administration of
Ro19-6327 was found to minimize the increase in metabolites of dopamine (DA)
following injection of levodopa. These results suggest that Ro19-6327 suppresses 
the metabolism of DA, resulting in increased effects of levodopa on parkinsonism 
induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). Thus, Ro19-6327
should be useful in the treatment of patients with Parkinson's disease.

Two young male common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) were injected
intracerebrally and intraperitoneally with a crude brain homogenate prepared from
a cow with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). Two other marmosets were
similarly injected with brain homogenate from a sheep with natural scrapie. The
two animals injected with scrapie material developed neurological signs 38 and 42
months after injection and the two animals injected with BSE material developed
neurological signs after 46 and 47 months. Post mortem examination of the brains 
revealed spongiform encephalopathy especially in the basal nuclei and
diencephalon of all the animals and, in addition, involvement of the cerebral
cortex of the marmosets injected with scrapie material. The experiment extends
the host range of experimental BSE to include a primate species.

Requirement of inner cell mass for efficient chorionic gonadotrophin secretion by
blastocysts of common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus).

Summers PM(1), Taylor CT, Miller MW.

Author information: 
(1)MRC/AFRC Comparative Physiology Research Group, Institute of Zoology, London, 
UK.

The role of the inner cell mass in the induction of chorionic gonadotrophin
synthesis and secretion by the trophoblast of the peri-implantation primate
blastocyst was studied in common marmoset monkeys. An in vitro system for the
culture of blastocysts commencing with blastocysts collected 8 days after
conception was developed. Chorionic gonadotrophin measured in the spent culture
fluid was first detected in most blastocysts after 3 or 4 days (day 11 or 12) of 
culture at a time equivalent to implantation in vitro. Initial secretion of
chorionic gonadotrophin coincided with development of parietal endoderm and
histological appearance of syncytiotrophoblast in the polar trophoblast. Little
chorionic gonadotrophin was secreted by blastocysts with a poorly developed, or
absent, inner cell mass. Mural trophoblast removed from blastocysts after 2 days 
of culture (day 10) grew in vitro as a unilaminar vesicle but failed to secrete
significant amounts of chorionic gonadotrophin. However, mural trophoblast from
older blastocysts (days 13 and 14) after chorionic gonadotrophin secretion had
commenced continued to secrete chorionic gonadotrophin, with trophoblast from day
14 blastocysts secreting significantly more than that from day 13. It was
concluded from these studies that while mural trophoblast from marmoset
blastocysts will proliferate in vitro in the absence of an inner cell mass,
efficient induction of chorionic gonadotrophin secretion requires the presence of
the inner cell mass or its derivatives. Once chorionic gonadotrophin secretion
has commenced, secretion will continue in the absence of the inner cell mass.

Local regulation of primate granulosa cell aromatase activity.

Hillier SG(1), Miró F.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University of Edinburgh, Scotland.

Granulosa cells produce inhibin and activin, proteins implicated in the local
regulation of preovulatory follicular development. To assess interactions among
FSH, LH, inhibin and activin on primate granulosa cell aromatase activity, we
studied primary granulosa cell cultures from the ovaries of the common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus), a monkey with an ovarian cycle similar in length to the
human cycle. The distinctive action of activin was augmentation of
gonadotropin-responsive aromatase activity throughout antral follicular
development. FSH-stimulated aromatase activity in granulosa cells from immature
follicles was augmented many fold by picomolar amounts of activin. In cell
cultures from preovulatory follicles, the presence of activin stimulated basal
aromatase activity in the absence of gonadotropin, as well as augmenting the
action of LH. Thus, locally produced activin has the potential to modulate
aromatase activity in developing ovarian follicles. By contrast, inhibin or
inhibin alpha-subunit purified from bovine follicular fluid had minimal effects
on aromatase activity. The only significant effect was slight suppression of
FSH-inducible aromatase activity in granulosa cells from immature follicles at an
inhibin concentration of 100 ng/ml. The finding that inhibin has a negligible
effect on aromatase activity in granulosa cells from mature follicles suggests
that it is unlikely to exert a physiologically significant influence on aromatase
activity in vivo. However, evidence from other studies suggests that inhibin
might affect aromatization indirectly through acting locally to modulate thecal
androgen (aromatase substate) production. Therefore, both inhibin and activin
have the potential to contribute at different levels to paracrine and autocrine
regulation of follicular oestrogen synthesis.

Effects of sex steroids on maternal motivation in the common marmoset (Callithrix
jacchus): development and application of an operant system with maternal
reinforcement.

Author information: 
(1)Anthropology Institute and Museum, University of Zurich, Switzerland.

We developed an operant paradigm for measuring effects of reproductive steroids
on maternal motivation in common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus). Conditioned
response regulated females' exposure to maternal reinforcement. Nulliparous
females (n = 15) with experience with infants in social groups were subjects. The
paradigm was validated by examining (a) effects of reinforcing stimuli on
affective behavior in a nonoperant paradigm, (b) responsiveness of operant
performance to changes in reinforcing stimuli and reinforcement schedule, (c)
changes in operant responding due to omission of reinforcement, and (d) relation 
between operant responding and species-typical maternal behavior. In pregnant
females, (n = 4), frequency of bar pressing and estradiol:progesterone ratio were
maximal just before birth. Nonpregnant females (n = 3) treated with progesterone

A novel population of tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactive neurones in the basal
forebrain of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).

We have observed in the basal forebrain of the common marmoset a group of
neurones which display tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity (THir) with three
different polyclonal antibodies and one monoclonal antibody, and which express TH
mRNA as shown by in situ hybridization histochemistry. The population of cells is
composed of large multipolar neurones and is located predominantly in the
substantia innominata and at the ventral, medial and lateral margins of the
external segment of the globus pallidus. The cell morphology and the distribution
of THir cells corresponds closely to the caudal portion of the nucleus basalis of
Meynert. Adjacent sections demonstrate both THir and choline acetyltransferase
immunoreactivity in the cells in this group, as well as strong
acetylcholinesterase activity but not dopamine immunoreactivity. These
observations indicate that many cholinergic neurones in the posterior nucleus
basalis of Meynert of the marmoset contain tyrosine hydroxylase, and suggest that
both acetylcholine and catecholamine may be synthesised as co-localised
neurotransmitters within the same magnocellular neurones. We observe no THir
cells in similar areas of the basal forebrain of either rhesus or talapoin
monkeys.

The stability of the vocal signature in phee calls of the common marmoset,
Callithrix jacchus.

Egham, Surrey, England.

Phee calls were recorded from five captive common marmosets on three occasions.
An initial recording session was followed by further sessions 1-12 days later,
and finally, 12 months after the initial sample. Sonograms from the first
recordings were measured using one duration and five frequency parameters, and
significant differences between individuals were found for all six parameters.
Discriminant function analysis was then applied to classify each call to a
particular individual, witn a resulting classification accuracy of 97.27%.
Analysis of the second and third recordings demonstrated accurate classification 
to the same caller using the measurements obtained from the initial sample. The
accuracy remained high despite intra-individual differences in acoustic structure
among the three recording periods. Such differences may well reflect proximate
changes in the underlying arousal state of the caller. Stability over time in the
vocal signature of the phee call supports the view that this vocalization may be 
important in signalling individual identity over long distances, in a habitat
where visual contact is limited. © 1993 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Observations on effects of neonatal castration upon sexual and aggressive
behavior in the male common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).

Dixson AF(1).

Author information: 
(1)MRC Reproductive Biology Unit, Edinburgh, Scotland.

The behavior of eight adult male marmosets that were bilaterally castrated during
neonatal life (postnatal days 1-7), a single unilaterally castrated male, and
eight age-matched intact adult males was observed during encounter tests with
unfamiliar conspecifics. When neonatally castrated (NC) males encountered
ovariectomized, estradiol-treated females, both partners were intensely
aggressive and 66% of tests were terminated to avoid injuries. No mounts
occurred, and females exhibited little or no sexual initiating behavior
(proceptivity) towards NC males. By contrast, encounters between NC males and
intact adult males were characterized by low levels of aggression and no tests
were terminated. Intact males frequently mounted NC males. However, NC males
initiated only 4% of these mounts by intact males and they refused or terminated 
67% of mount attempts and mounts by intact males. The age-matched intact adult
males provided data which differed markedly from those obtained using NC males.
The intact males were highly aggressive during encounters with other intact
males, whereas they mounted and ejaculated when paired with females. The single
male which had been unilaterally castrated in infancy provided similar results to
the intact males. These experiments indicate that neonatal castration has
profound effects upon the development of sexual and aggressive behavior in male
marmosets. However, the stimulus qualities as well as the behavior of males are
altered by neonatal castration, so that unfamiliar conspecifics react towards
them as females during paired encounters. This finding complicates the
interpretation of effects of neonatal castration upon development of sexually
dimorphic behavioral patterns in male marmosets. Behavioral effects of castration
later in postnatal development romain to be determined. © 1993 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Context and gender-specific differences in the acoustic structure of common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) phee calls.

Norcross JL(1), Newman JD(1).

Author information: 
(1)Laboratory of Comparative Ethology, NICHD, NIH, Poolesville, Maryland.

Captive adult common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) produce whistle-like "phee"
calls in two contexts; in the home cage environment, phee calls may function as
part of territorial marking behavior, and when animals are separated from social 
companions, phee calls may serve to reunite the group. Isolation phee calls tend 
to have more syllables than calls produced in the home cage by the same animals, 
and as a result, are longer in duration. The durations of isolation call
syllables are shorter than in home cage calls, and isolation calls have lower
start and end frequencies, higher peak frequencies, and increased frequency range
compared to phee calls produced by the same animals in their home cages. The
modifications made to the general structure of the phee call by isolated animals 
result in more information that may indicate context or location of an isolated
caller. When the vocalizations were analyzed by sex, between-sex differences in
call structure appeared consistently in both contexts. Males tended to exhibit
higher call frequencies and greater variability between syllables than females.

Mhc-DRB genes of platyrrhine primates.

The two infraorders of anthropoid primates, Platyrrhini (New World monkeys) and
Catarrhini (Old World monkeys and the hominoids) are estimated to have diverged
from a common ancestor 37 million years ago. The major histocompatibility complex
class II DRB gene and haplotype polymorphism of the Catarrhini has been
characterized in several recent studies. The present study was undertaken to
obtain information on the DRB polymorphism of the Platyrrhini. Fifty-five
complete exon 2 DRB sequences were obtained from six species of Platyrrhini
representing both the Callitrichidae and the Cebidae families. Combined with the 
results of a parallel contig mapping study, our data indicate that at least three
loci (DRB1*03, DRB3, and DRB5) are shared by the Catarrhini and the Platyrrhini. 
However, the three loci are occupied by functional genes in the former infraorder
and mostly by pseudogenes in the latter. Instead of the pseudogenes, the
Platyrrhini have evolved a new set of apparently functional genes-DRB11 and
DRB*W12 through DRB*W19, which have thus far not been found in the Catarrhini.
The DRB*W13, *W14, *W15, *W17, *W18, and *W19 genes seem to be restricted to the 
Cebidae family, whereas the DRB*W16 locus has so far been documented in the
Callitrichidae family only. The DRB alleles of the cotton-top tamarin, and
perhaps also those of the common marmoset (both members of the family
Callitrichidae), are characterized by low nucleotide diversity, possibly
indicating that they diverged from a common ancestral gene relatively recently.

A DNA fragment covering marmoset interferon gamma (MaIFN-gamma) was cloned from
the DNA of peripheral blood leucocytes, sequenced and compared to its human
IFN-gamma counterpart. The two nucleotide sequences were found to be highly
homologous (90.3%). The position of the exons are directly comparable with those 
of the human IFN-gamma gene and follows the pattern of structural conservation
found elsewhere. The present work makes available recombinant MaIFN-gamma for
animal experiments.

Social organization in a wild population of Callithrix jacchus. I. Group
composition and dynamics.

Data are presented on group dynamics in a wild population of the common marmoset,
Callithrix jacchus, in northeastern Brazil. Three marked and habituated groups
were observed, and composition noted, for at least 5 days a month over 12-18
consecutive months. Group sizes ranged from 5 to 15 individuals, and changes in
group composition were the result of births, immigrations, and disappearances. No
immigrations into the main study groups were observed throughout the study
period. None of the three known emigrants was known to join an established or
incipient group for up to 10 weeks after their departure. One group contained
only breeding individuals and their offspring. Observations of recruitment and
loss in the other two groups suggest that they, too, were extended family groups.
The group dynamics described in studies of other populations of Callithrix
suggest that extended family groups, or at least groups consisting of breeding
individuals and their close relatives, may be characteristic of those
populations.

Tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive neurons in the nucleus basalis of the common 
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).

Nova Scotia, Canada.

In the course of characterizing the distribution of putative catecholaminergic
neurons in the brain of the common marmoset, we encountered a population of such 
cells in the basal forebrain. Tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive neurons are
abundant within the nucleus basalis magnocellularis throughout its entire
rostrocaudal extent, but not in other cholinergic basal forebrain nuclei. Most
tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive cells are large and multipolar. Double
staining with antibodies to choline acetyltransferase or nerve growth factor
receptor confirmed that these tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive neurons are
cholinergic, and compose at least 40% of the nucleus basalis cholinergic cells.
The presence of a catecholamine-synthesizing enzyme in the neurons that provide
the major cholinergic input to the neocortex may have important consequences for 
cortical function, and may be relevant to the vulnerability of the nucleus
basalis in certain neurodegenerative disorders.

Evidence that most of the radioimmunoassayable inhibin secreted by the corpus
luteum of the common marmoset monkey is of a non-dimeric form.

Author information:

United Kingdom.

Although recent data for several species of primate, including human and
marmoset, indicate that the corpus luteum secretes high levels of
radioimmunoassayable inhibin, the nature of the immunoreactive (ir) inhibin
detected has not been established. In this study, plasma ir-inhibin levels during
the ovarian cycle of the marmoset (n = 12 animals) were measured by
alpha-subunit-directed inhibin RIA, and values were compared with those estimated
by a recently developed two-site immunoradiometric assay (IRMA) specific for
inhibin alpha-beta dimer. Consistent with earlier data, plasma levels of
ir-inhibin measured by RIA (overall mean value 133 +/- 7 ng/ml; n = 171) reached 
values 4-fold higher (p less than 0.001) during the luteal phase (222 +/- 20
ng/ml) than during the follicular phase (58 +/- 8 ng/ml), being directly
correlated with plasma progesterone levels (r = 0.65; p less than 0.001). In
contrast, plasma ir-inhibin levels estimated by IRMA were substantially lower
than those measured by RIA (overall mean value 9.62 +/- 1.08 ng/ml; n = 171) and 
did not vary significantly during the cycle. Administration of a luteolytic dose 
of cloprostenol during the late luteal phase/early pregnancy led to an abrupt
fall in plasma concentrations of progesterone (95%) and alpha-inhibin measured by
RIA (82%), whereas dimeric inhibin levels remained unchanged. Analysis of
marmoset luteal extracts (n = 5) by RIA, IRMA, and inhibin bioassay yielded
inhibin estimates of 102.6 +/- 21.0, 0.632 +/- 0.103, and less than 2.0 ng/mg,
respectively, thus confirming that only a very small proportion of the inhibin
produced was dimeric (i.e., bioactive) in nature.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250

The published knowledge on neurobiological, psychological, and ethological
aspects of development in Callithrix jacchus is still limited. We have collected 
published and unpublished data from several Callithrix colonies and pooled
information on criteria for developmental progress and maturation using a
questionnaire sent to numerous experts in the field. The data suggest that
developmental stages can be defined not only for the embryonic and fetal but also
for the postnatal period. Based on multifactorial definitions, using criteria
selected from maturational changes in the motor and visual systems and behavioral
features, we propose to subdivide postnatal development of the common marmoset
into seven periods ("stages").

Twenty-one epiphyses were examined and five stages of ossification were described
for each. The animals were divided into nine groups, according to age, and a
table of the stage of ossification and age was produced, which may be used for
determining the age of animals of unknown history.

Behavioural effects of anxiogenic agents in the common marmoset.

Author information: 
(1)School of Pharmacy, University of Bradford, West Yorkshire, UK.

The effects of the anxiogenic agents FG7142, caffeine, pentylenetetrazole, and
amphetamine were assessed in two anxiety situations in the marmoset, first in an 
"anxiogenic" test based on the animal's response to a human observer standing in 
front of the home cage and second in a low-anxiety situation where animals
behaviour was videotaped in the absence of the observer. In response to the human
observer, the anxiolytic agent diazepam (0.1-2.5 mg/kg, SC) was shown to reduce
the intensity of behaviours such as postures, while increasing time spent on the 
cage front. In this test, with the exception of amphetamine, which only modified 
responding at stereotypic doses, the anxiogenic agents failed to modify marmoset 
behaviour. In contrast, in the low-anxiety filming protocol the anxiogenic agents
consistently reduced measures of locomotor activity while increasing the amount
of time animals spent in the nest box. It is suggested that the low-anxiety
protocol may be useful to evaluate drug-induced anxiogenesis and in studies of
withdrawal from chronic anxiolytic treatment or drugs of abuse.

The distribution of the binding of [3H]GR65630 (0.2 nM) to putative 5-HT3
recognition sites in the brain of the common marmoset was assessed using
autoradiography. Specific binding was heterogeneously distributed with the
highest densities found in discrete nuclei of the lower medulla (nucleus tractus 
solitarii, dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve, nucleus of spinal trigeminal 
nerve tract and the area postrema). In forebrain areas, relatively high binding
densities were located in the medial habenula nucleus and the hippocampus (CA3,
CA4 and fascia dentata). Low levels of specific binding in the rest of the
forebrain hindered quantification.

Analysis of the contraceptive potential of antibodies against native and
deglycosylated porcine ZP3 in vivo and in vitro.

RJ.

We have undertaken a comparative analysis of the contraceptive activity of
antibodies directed against the porcine sperm receptor zona pellucida antigen
(ZP3) and its Mr = 32,000 polypeptide core (DGZP-32). The strategies employed for
this analysis included the induction of active immunity in a primate, the common 
marmoset, and an in vitro fertilization protocol involving the use of viable
human ova. In both experimental situations, antibodies against ZP3 were shown to 
exhibit contraceptive activity, leading respectively to the induction of
long-term infertility in the primate model and to the complete inhibition of
human fertilization in vitro. The in vivo studies also revealed that the
induction of high titer antibodies against ZP3 was inevitably associated with the
appearance of an ovarian pathology characterized by the progressive depletion of 
the primordial follicle pool within one to two years. This side effect could not 
be alleviated by the use of DGZP-32 as antigen since the induction of immunity
against this polypeptide was also associated with the eventual appearance of an
ovarian pathology identical to that observed with ZP3. Furthermore, the DGZP-32
peptide was less effective than ZP3 in inducing the formation of antibodies
capable of inhibiting the fertilization of human ova in vitro. We conclude that
significant problems remain with the use of deglycosylated zona peptides for the 
development of contraceptive vaccines and that their potential will not be
realized until the epitopes responsible for the induction of infertility and the 
primordial follicle depletion have been identified and segregated.

Sex ratio and mortality in a laboratory colony of the common marmoset (Callithrix
jacchus).

Author information: 
(1)Institute of Anthropology, University of Goettingen, Germany.

In a retrospective study sex ratio and mortality were analysed in a captive
colony of common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus). Seven hundred and thirty-five
infants in 294 litters (20 singletons, 119 twins, 140 triplets, 14 quadruplets)
out of 57 breeding females were evaluated. The sex ratio at birth was 0.95
males:1.0 females. The frequency of males and females, as well as the sex
composition of twins and triplets confirm the assumption of dizygotic twinning in
the common marmoset. According to age at death, 9 categories were differentiated,
with perinatal mortality being the highest. Once early infancy had passed the
probability of a common marmoset infant of our colony reaching childhood is
nearly 95%. Sixty per cent of all liveborn infants survived beyond 18 months.
Mortality of infants at birth from primiparous mothers did not differ from that
of pluriparous females, nor did the survival rate of infants with the filial
generation the respective female had reached (F1 to F6). Females with a high
ratio of triplets and quadruplets had a lower reproductive success than females
with a majority of singleton or twin deliveries. Differential mortality between
males and females was not observed. The frequency of stillbirths was not strongly
related to parity, but was to litter-size. Most stillborn babies were seen in
sets of quadruplets, most abortions in singletons. A normal socialization in a
stable social environment, as well as not pairing the animals before they are
fully adult, are considered important factors in good breeding success and infant
survival.

Synergism of NBQX with dopamine agonists in the 6-OHDA rat model of Parkinson's
disease.

Löschmann PA(1), Kunow M, Wachtel H.

Author information: 
(1)Research Laboratories, Schering AG, Berlin, Federal Republic of Germany.

Advance in understanding of the anatomy, physiology and pharmacology of basal
ganglia organisation over the past decade revealed a functional relation between 
excitatory glutamatergic and the degenerated dopaminergic nigrostriatal
transmitter systems which could serve as targets for pharmacological
interventions in Parkinson's disease. The selective AMPA-antagonist NBQX is not
effective in animal models of Parkinson's disease when given alone but
ameliorates parkinsonian symptomatology and enhances the locomotor response of a 
threshold dose of L-DOPA. These synergistic effects are seen in the MPTP-treated 
(1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) common marmoset and the rat with
unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesions of the substantia nigra. Here we
report that, in the latter model, such synergism of NBQX is also seen with the
direct dopamine agonists lisuride and apomorphine, indicating the potential
usefulness of AMPA antagonists for the symptomatic treatment of Parkinson's
disease.

In situ hybridization histochemistry was used to localize tyrosine hydroxylase
(TH) mRNA and cholecystokinin (CCK) mRNA-expressing cells in the ventral
mesencephalon of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) and to examine the
effects of the dopaminergic (DA) neurotoxin,
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) on these two populations of
neurons in the pars compacta of the substantia nigra (SNc) and ventral tegmental 
area (VTA). X-ray film and liquid emulsion autoradiography of brain sections
hybridized with an 35S-labelled synthetic 45-mer antisense human TH
oligonucleotide probe showed strong hybridization signals and dense populations
of TH mRNA expressing cells in the SNc and VTA at all levels, in the control
marmoset brain. In the MPTP-treated brain, there was a substantial reduction of
TH mRNA in the ventral midbrain. The loss of TH mRNA-expressing cells amounted to
98% in the lateral SNc, 88% in the medial SNc and 33% in the VTA. In situ
hybridization of adjacent sections with an 35S-labelled synthetic 45-mer
antisense human CCK oligonucleotide probe showed a weak hybridization signal for 
CCK mRNA in the ventral midbrain of the control brain. Emulsion autoradiography
demonstrated CCK mRNA expressing cells in the SNc and VTA at all levels with the 
number of cells in the VTA similar to that for TH mRNA. However, the number of
cells in the SNc expressing CCK mRNA was a fraction (1/4) of that expressing TH
mRNA; moreover, the level of expression per cell was substantially less than that
for TH mRNA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

The protein encoded by herpesvirus saimiri transforming gene STP-C488 was
identified and characterized. Antibodies were produced in rabbits by immunization
with keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated synthetic peptides specific for the
predicted sequence of STP-C488. STP-C488-encoded protein was detected in
recombinant Escherichia coli, transformed Rat-1 cells, transfected COS-1 cells,
and in common marmoset T lymphocytes immortalized by herpesvirus saimiri strain
488. STP-C488 protein was sensitive to treatment by bacterial collagenase,
consistent with the 18 uninterrupted collagenlike repeats predicted by the DNA
sequence. The apparent molecular size of STP-C488 in sodium dodecyl sulfate
(SDS)-polyacrylamide gels (20 to 22 kDa) was considerably larger than that
predicted from the DNA sequence (9.9 kDa). Using indirect immunofluorescence
tests and subcellular fractionation, STP-C488 was found to be membrane bound,
primarily in perinuclear compartments. The 18 uninterrupted collagenlike repeats,
sensitivity to collagenase, location in the cell, and anomalous migration through
SDS-polyacrylamide gels suggest an unusual, membrane-associated, fibrous
structure for this transforming herpesvirus oncoprotein.

Distribution and morphology of substance P-immunoreactive structures in the
olfactory bulb and olfactory peduncle of the common marmoset (Callithrix
jacchus), a primate species.

The present study describes the morphology and distribution of substance
P-immunoreactive (SP-ir) elements in the olfactory bulb (OB) and olfactory
peduncle (OP) of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a primate species.
SP-ir neurons are very abundant in the OB and belong to two types. External
tufted cells are present in the glomerular layer (GL), whereas granule cells are 
found in the deeper layers, especially in the granule cell layer (GRL), but also 
scattered in the OP. SP-ir fibers, putatively of central origin, were identified 
in the OP. They ascend into the bulbar layers. The SP-chemoarchitecture of the
marmoset OB and OP does not differ more from rat, guinea pig and cat, than the
SP-chemoarchitecture of these species varies among one another.

Callitrichid hepatitis (CH) is an acute, often fatal viral infection of New World
primates from the family Callitrichidae. The etiologic agent of CH is unknown. We
report here the isolation of an arenavirus from a common marmoset (Callithrix
jacchus) with CH by using in vitro cultures of marmoset hepatocytes and Vero-E6
cells. Enveloped virions 67 to 133 nm in diameter with ribosomelike internal
structures were seen in infected cultures. Immunofluorescence and Western
immunoblot analysis using CH-specific antisera (principally from animals exposed 
to CH during zoo outbreaks) revealed three antigens in cells infected with this
CH-associated virus (CHV). These antigens had the same electrophoretic mobilities
on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels as did the nucleocapsid, GP2, and
GPC proteins of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). Monoclonal antibodies 
specific for these arenavirus proteins also reacted with the three CHV antigens. 
Conversely, the CH-specific antisera reacted with the nucleocapsid, GP2, and GPC 
proteins of LCMV. CHV thus appears to be a close antigenic relative of LCMV. The 
serologic association of CHV with several CH outbreaks implicate it as the
etiologic agent of this disease.

Lipoprotein(a) and apolipoprotein(a) in a New World monkey, the common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus). Association of variable plasma lipoprotein(a) levels with a
single apolipoprotein(a) isoform.

In an earlier report (Chapman et al, Biochemistry 1979;18:5096-5108), we
suggested that the common marmoset may represent an important model for the study
of human plasma lipoprotein metabolism. We now extend the interest of this monkey
model to the study of lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]) and apolipoprotein(a) (apo[a]).
Density gradient ultracentrifugal fractionation of marmoset plasma revealed a
bimodal distribution of Lp(a), with one peak of concentration occurring in
association with very low density lipoproteins (VLDLs) and a second in the
density range 1.040-1.080 g/ml. The dense Lp(a) subspecies displayed
physicochemical properties (chemical composition, particle size, and
electrophoretic mobility) that closely resembled those of its counterpart in
humans and baboons but that were distinct from those of low density lipoprotein
(LDL). Furthermore, the particle size of marmoset Lp(a) was invariant (31 nm)
over the density interval 1.040-1.080 g/ml, whereas that of LDL decreased
progressively with an increase in density (approximately 26-25.2 nm). Use of
polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies to human apo(a) and of a polyclonal antibody
to marmoset Lp(a) allowed immunologic identification of a single apo(a) isoform
in the marmoset whose size was similar to that of apo B-100; apo(a) and apo B-100
were associated in Lp(a) particles by a disulfide linkage. The total protein mass
of apo-Lp(a) was estimated to be 800,000 or more by electrophoresis in sodium
dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide-agarose gels. The amino acid compositions of
marmoset and human apo(a) resembled each other but were distinct from those of
the corresponding forms of apo B-100. Immunologic evidence is provided for a high
degree of cross reactivity between apo(a) in marmosets, baboons, and humans,
supporting the idea of the existence of a marked degree of structural homology
between these proteins. In addition, electroimmunoblotting of marmoset apo(a) and
marmoset plasminogen showed that these proteins shared certain epitopes in
common, suggesting that marmoset apo(a) may possess kringle-like structural
features. Finally, despite possession of a single apo(a) isoform, marmoset Lp(a) 
levels varied over a 100-fold range (0.5-49 mg/dl plasma). Considered together,
our present findings suggest that the common marmoset monkey constitutes a unique
model in which to study the regulation of apo(a) gene expression and the
posttranslational processing of apo(a), as well as factors that modulate the
synthesis, intravascular metabolism, and cellular catabolism of Lp(a).

Elizabeth Hospital, Woodville, South Australia.

The authors examined the seminal characteristics of 16 male common marmosets
(Callithrix jacchus) to provide baseline data for future studies of the
reproductive biology of this species. Semen samples were collected by
electroejaculation. There was considerable inter- and intra-male variation in all
seminal characteristics. The median seminal volume was 30 microliters (range 8 to
85 microliters), and the median total sperm count was 5.1 x 10(6) sperm (range,
0.1 to 43 x 10(6]. The median progressive sperm motility was 48% (range, 10% to
76%), and 49% of the sperm exhibited normal morphology (range, 24% to 81%). Three
types of sperm head abnormalities and eight types of tail defects were noted.
Tail defects were common (median, 50%; range, 17% to 76%), whereas head defects
were relatively rare (median, 4.5%; range, 0% to 24%). The results indicate that 
semen samples can be routinely collected from this species, but considerable
inter- and intra-male variation can be expected. It is therefore important to
examine several semen samples from each male marmoset to obtain an accurate
seminal picture.

Development of a monoclonal antibody, anti-6C2, which is involved in the
interaction of CD4 T helper cells and activated B cells.

We have developed a mAb anti-6C2, by immunizing mice with T cell line derived
from the Callithrix jacchus (common marmoset). Anti-6C2 is reactive with
approximately 50% of unfractionated T cells, 50% of CD4+ cells, and 40% of CD8+
cells. Regarding CD4+ cells, anti-6C2-reactive cells substantially overlap with
the CD29+CD45RO+ Th cell population. Moreover, anti-6C2 can divide these T cells 
into 6C2+ and 6C2- subpopulations. The CD4+CD45RO+6C2+ cells maximally respond to
soluble Ag such as tetanus toxoid and provide strong helper function for
PWM-driven B cell IgG synthesis. Most interestingly, anti-6C2 was also reactive
against activated B cells but not resting B cells; furthermore, this epitope was 
inducible through activation of resting B cells or B cell line. Biochemical
characterization showed that anti-6C2 precipitated two glycoproteins with the
relative molecular weights of 180,000 and 95,000 from 125I-surface labeled cell
lysate. Sequential immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that these two
glycoproteins were the lymphocyte function-associated antigen (LFA-1) Ag complex 
(CD11a/18). Significantly, although this antibody did not inhibit cytotoxic
killer T cell responses and Ag-induced T cell proliferation as did conventional
anti-LFA-1, it did inhibit PWM-driven B cell IgG synthesis. Because 6C2
expression was induced after B cell activation, the above results strongly
suggest that the 6C2 molecule may play a role in the interaction of CD4 helper
cells and activated B lymphocytes.

Neurochemical and behavioural features induced by chronic low dose treatment with
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) in the common marmoset:
implications for Parkinson's disease?

Protracted long-term treatment of common marmosets with 15 doses (0.5-4.5 mg/kg, 
i.p.) of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP; total dose 25 mg/kg,
given over 29 days) caused transitory changes in motor behaviour reminiscent of
human Parkinson's disease. 16 days from the start of MPTP administration, all
animals showed motor impairment, consisting of profound akinesia and a rigid
posture, but in no case resting tremor. Biogenic amines were measured in
nigrostriatal regions one month after finishing MPTP treatment. There was a
profound loss of dopamine and serotonin in the substantia nigra and in the
striatum; noradrenaline was only reduced in the putamen. Continuous analyses of
the concentrations of biogenic amine metabolites in the CSF during this study
revealed persistent dopaminergic disturbances and temporary alterations in
serotoninergic and noradrenergic function.

The present report documents the breeding success of a new colony of common
marmosets (Callithrix jacchus jacchus) and demonstrates a correlation between
environmental stress and reproductive success. Environmental conditions ranged
chronologically over 40 months, through four periods: I) the initial period, when
the colony was formed; II) a phase of relative environmental stability; III) a
stage of "environmental stress" (when the colony was disrupted by nearby
construction); and IV) a return to a stable environment. Examination of
reproductive status during each period indicated that the colony exhibited severe
reproductive suppression during the time of the environmental disruption. Parity 
and the number of live births decreased and the number of spontaneous abortions
increased during this period. Reproductive success remained low during period IV.
More triplets than twins were born during the period of relative environmental
stability.

Synergism of the AMPA-antagonist NBQX and the NMDA-antagonist CPP with L-dopa in

Degeneration of dopaminergic nigrostriatal neurons in Parkinson's disease results
in an overactivity of excitatory glutamatergic projections from the subthalamic
nucleus to the output nuclei of the basal ganglia resulting in rigidity and
akinesia. In theory pharmacological blockade of these overactive systems should
improve parkinsonian symptomatology. The selective AMPA-antagonist NBQX and the
competitive NMDA-antagonist CPP are not effective in animal models of Parkinson's
disease when given alone but ameliorate parkinsonian symptomatology and stimulate
locomotor activity when co-administered with a threshold dose of L-Dopa. These
synergistic effects are seen in the MPTP-treated
(1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) common marmoset and the rat with
unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesions of the substantia nigra. Therefore 
competitive NMDA and non-NMDA antagonists may offer a new therapeutic strategy
for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.

The local domain for divergence of subcortical afferents to the striate and
extrastriate visual cortex in the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus): a
multiple labelling study.

In the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), the cortical projection from the
pulvinar and other diencephalic structures into the striate and prestriate cortex
was investigated with various fluorescent retrograde tracers. Single cortical
injections as well as multiple injections at distances of 1-2 mm with one tracer 
into an extended but coherent cortical region were applied. Fields with multiple 
injections were placed so that they touched each other (minimal distances 2 to 3 
mm). Retrogradely labelled cells in the LGN and/or the pulvinar were arranged in 
coherent columns, volumes or slabs, but cell volumes resulting from neighbouring 
cortical injections overlapped at their border (for details of the
thalamo-cortical topography see the companion paper Dick et al. (1991]. Double
labelled cells (dl) were only found in the zones of overlap of the cell volumes
labelled by the respective tracers. The relative number of dl-cells in these
overlap zones was 6.2 +/- 3.1%. The dl-frequency was the same in the various
nuclei of the pulvinar and the LGN. In the main layers of LGN, dl-cells were
found only in the overlap zone of two injection fields into area 17, but a few
dl-cells were found in interlaminar cells after injections into area 17 and 18.
Maximal cortical distances between injection fields which produced dl in the
pulvinar, were 3 to exceptionally 4 mm but dl was highest at injection distances 
less than or equal to 2.5 mm and decreased sharply at wider distances. Such
overlap zones were concerned with identical or overlapping regions of visual
field representation in the cortex and probably also in the pulvinar. Although in
individual experiments up to four different tracers were injected into different 
striate/prestriate regions, often embracing the same visual field representation,
individual cells in the pulvinar showed dl from maximally only two tracers
injected into neighbouring cortical regions. We conclude that dl in the posterior
thalamic projection nuclei is determined essentially by cortical distance and
thus reflects the local domain of branching of thalamo-cortical afferents.
Pruning of such branches during development may further restrict bifurcating
axons to identical visual field representations, but representation of identical 
visual field regions in different visual areas is not, per se, a sufficient
condition for dl. It is not found if such regions are further apart from each
other than the typical local domain of 2-3 mm, exceptionally up to 4 mm in one
experiment after injections into area 17 and MT.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

Motor activity following the administration of selective D-1 and D-2 dopaminergic
drugs to normal common marmosets.

Author information: 
(1)Parkinson's Disease Society Experimental Research Laboratories, King's
College, London, UK.

In normal common marmosets administration of the D-1/D-2 agonist apomorphine or
the selective D-2 agonist quinpirole caused a dose-dependent increase in motor
activity and induced stereotyped behaviour. Both the selective D-2 antagonist
raclopride and the selective D-1 antagonist SCH 23390 inhibited normal locomotor 
activity and induced catalepsy. Quinpirole- and apomorphine-induced motor
activity were potently inhibited by pretreatment with raclopride. The effects of 
quinpirole, but not apomorphine, were weakly inhibited by SCH 23390. The
selective D-1 partial agonist SKF 38393 decreased motor activity and did not
induce grooming, oral movements or other behaviours. SKF 38393 inhibited motor
activity induced by the administration of quinpirole but did not alter
apomorphine-induced motor behaviour. Locomotor activity in normal common
marmosets appears to be mediated mainly via D-2 systems. In contrast to rodents, 
administration of SKF 38393 does not induce behavioural activation and there does
not appear to be a facilitating effect of D-1 systems on D-2 function in the
normal common marmoset. However, the ability of both SKF 38393 and SCH 23390 to
inhibit quinpirole locomotor activity suggests some interaction between D-1 and
D-2 systems to occur in this species.

Inhibin secretion during the ovulatory cycle and pregnancy in the common marmoset
monkey.

(1)MRC Reproductive Biology Unit, Centre for Reproductive Biology, Edinburgh.

Changes in plasma concentrations of immunoreactive inhibin in the reproductively 
cyclic, pregnant and ovariectomized female marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus)
were measured with a heterologous radioimmunoassay. The pattern of inhibin
secretion in five marmosets studied individually during four consecutive cycles
was shown to resemble that of progesterone. In these animals, data were pooled
according to stage of cycle on the basis of plasma progesterone concentrations.
Mean values for inhibin were 5465 and 4972 U/l during the early and late
follicular phase. Concentrations rose during the luteal phase to 8431, 12,246 and
12,557 U/l for the early, mid- and late luteal phase respectively. The hormonal
profile of inhibin during the normal cycle is similar in both marmoset and
stumptailed macaque; however, the marmoset has a 28-fold greater level of inhibin
during the luteal phase. In six marmosets in which pregnancy occurred, inhibin
concentrations showed no decline at the end of the conceptual cycle and remained 
increased with respect to the follicular phase throughout the subsequent
gestation. Inhibin levels were non-detectable (less than 1000 U/l) in
ovariectomized and acyclic marmosets. These results suggest that the corpus
luteum is the major source of inhibin in this New World monkey, in common with
man and the Old World primates.

Central Oxytocin Stimulates Luteinizing Hormone Release in the Marmoset, a
Primate which Fails to Show Lactationally-lnduced Infertility.

O'Byrne KT(1), Lunn SF, Coen CW.

Author information: 
(1)MRC Reproductive Biology Unit, 37 Chalmers Street, Edinburgh EH3 9EW, UK.

In several species, including humans, suckling is known to suppress pulsatile
gonadotrophin secretion and substantially reduce fertility (1). During suckling
high titres of oxytocin are present in both plasma (2, 3) and cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF) (4) and there is some evidence that oxytocin is inhibitory to gonadotrophin
secretion by an action on t h e central nervous system, (5, 6). The common
marmoset, however, has a different physiological response and fails to show
lactational infertility; ovarian cyclicity is resumed immediately post-partum
(7). We have therefore examined the effect of centrally administered oxytocin on 
luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion in this species. We report that LH release was
stimulated with a rapid:esponse and in a dose-dependent manner by oxytocin
injected into t h e third cerebral ventricle. In contrast, oxytocin administered 
intravenously was without effect on LH secretion. These results clearly indicate,
for the first time, a stimulatory role for oxytocin in LH secretion in the
marmoset, a species which fails to demonstrate lactational infertility.

The facial artery of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).

Takeda Y(1), Okuda H.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Anatomy, Osaka Dental University, Japan.

The facial artery and its ramifications in 7 adult common marmosets (Callithrix
jacchus) were studied by the plastic injection method. The findings obtained are 
discussed in comparison with those for other primates. In the submandibular
region, the facial artery arose from the external carotid artery at the height of
the atlas via the linguofacial trunk on 10 of the total of 14 sides examined and 
independently on the other 4 sides. This common trunk always gave rise to the
superior thyroid artery. The facial artery passed anterolaterally between the
styloglossus muscle and the intermediate tendon of the digastricus muscle, giving
off the styloglossal and the submandibular glandular branches, and
anteroinferiorly medial to the pterygoideus medialis muscle. In a position
anterior to this muscle, the submental artery and masseteric branch were derived.
The submental artery gave off the medial pterygoid, the digastric, the cutaneous,
the sublingual glandular and the mylohyoid branches, and then continued up to the
median line, where it terminated to supply the genioglossus muscle. In the facial
region, the facial artery passed anterosuperiorly along the anterior margin of
the masseter muscle on 12 sides and away from it forwards on 2 sides, giving off 
the premasseteric branch in one of these 2 sides. It gave rise to the cutaneous, 
the buccal and the buccinator branches, the inferior labial artery and the
communicating branch with the zygomatic artery. It terminated to divide into the 
superior labial and the naris lateral arteries, although the latter was lacking
on 4 sides. The inferior labial artery gave off the mandibular marginal, the
inferior labial marginal and the inferior labial glandular branches and
terminated to anastomose with the mental artery. The superior labial artery
divided into the superficial and deep branches, each of which continued as a
nasal septal branch. The facial artery of the common marmoset usually ascended
along the anterior margin of the masseter muscle and did not reach the medial
angle of the eye.

Screening procedure for assessment of ototoxicity in the common marmoset.

Author information: 
(1)Division of Pathology and Toxicology, Glaxo Group Research Ltd., Ware,
Hertfordshire, United Kingdom.

Detection of drug-induced ototoxicity in safety evaluation studies of novel
chemical entities is rarely attempted. Where such examinations are included, they
usually rely on reflex testing. The Brainstem Auditory Evoked Response can be
measured with the use of externally positioned electrodes, and it monitors
electrophysiologic responses to sound from the cochlear nerve and associated
structures of the 8th cranial nerve. These responses have been reproducibly
measured in sedated marmosets and the method shown to be a sensitive detector of 
hearing loss caused by loop diuretics or aminoglycoside antibiotics.
additionally, where hearing damage is reversible, recovery can also be monitored.
It is proposed that where a sensitive marker for ototoxicity is considered
necessary as part of a multifaceted study investigating in vivo drug safety, this
procedure may prove advantageous over existing methods.

atherosclerosis. The lipoproteins of animals fed a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet 
and a high-fat (12% wt/wt lard), high-cholesterol (0.34% wt/wt) diet were
characterized by the combination of sequential ultracentrifugation and Pevikon
block electrophoresis. Based on chemical and physical properties, equivalents of 
human very low density lipoproteins (VLDL), low density lipoproteins (LDL), and
high density lipoproteins (HDL), including and HDL-with apolipoprotein E
subclass, were demonstrated. In control animals, whose plasma cholesterol
concentration was 140.1 +/- 20.2 mg/dl (means +/- SD), approximately 40% of the
plasma cholesterol was transported by LDL as compared with approximately 70% in
humans. The cholesterol-fed marmosets segregated into two groups: hypo- and
hyper-responders. The hyper-responders had plasma cholesterol levels of 450 to
970 mg/ml. The hypercholesterolemia was associated with elevated concentrations
of VLDL, intermediate density lipoproteins, and LDL; in addition, these
lipoproteins were enriched in cholesteryl esters relative to lipoproteins
isolated from control animals. The HDL (d greater than 1.09 g/ml) levels did not 
change in response to cholesterol feeding, although the HDL-with apolipoprotein E
found in the d = 1.02 to 1.09 g/ml fraction increased approximately fivefold.
Based on immunological characteristics and sialic acid content, the common
marmoset appeared to lack a lipoprotein(a) equivalent. The results of a
short-term feeding study (11 months) suggest that this monkey was susceptible to 
the development of diet-induced atherosclerosis. The hyper-responsive animals
developed foam cell lesions and moderately proliferative intimal lesions,
predominantly within the thoracic aorta. In summary, the results of our studies
indicate that the common marmoset monkey potentially is a useful model for the
study of both lipoprotein metabolism and diet-induced atherosclerosis.

To explore the potential of the common marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus) as a 
model for human plasma lipoprotein metabolism, several marmoset apolipoproteins
were isolated and characterized in this study. Based on several properties,
including molecular weight, amino acid composition, and sequence, the marmoset
apolipoproteins are strikingly similar to human apolipoprotein (apo) A-I, A-II,
C-III, and A-IV. The first 54 residues of marmoset apo A-I showed 87% sequence
identity with the corresponding region of human apo A-I. Amino-terminal sequence 
analysis of a minor basic apo A-I isoform revealed that it contained an
amino-terminal hexapeptide extension (Arg-His-Phe-Gln-Gln-) identical to that
found in human proapo A-I. Like apo A-II in most nonhuman primates, marmoset
apo-A-II differed from human apo A-II in that it did not contain cysteine and
therefore existed as a monomer. The complete amino acid sequence of marmoset apo 
A-II was deduced. The protein contains 77 amino acids, as does human apo A-II,
and showed an 82% identity with its human equivalent. In both species, apo C-III 
and E had similar amino-terminal sequences and amino acid compositions. Like
human apo E, marmoset apo E contained minor sialylated isoforms. However, unlike 
human apo C-III, no sialyated isoforms of marmoset apo C-III were observed. In
addition, the marmoset possessed an apolipoprotein whose molecular weight and
amino acid composition were similar to those of human apo A-IV. The close
structural similarities between corresponding marmoset and human apolipoproteins 
indicate that the marmoset monkey will be useful as a model for human lipoprotein
metabolism.

1-Methyl-4-(2'-methylphenyl)-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (2'-methyl-MPTP) is less 
neurotoxic than MPTP in the common marmoset.

Sciences Division, King's College, London, U.K.

Four adult marmosets were treated with increasing doses of
1-methyl-4-(2'-methylphenyl)-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (2'-methyl-MPTP) in the
range 0.23-4.3 mg/kg i.p. to give a cumulative dose of 11.0-11.6 mg/kg over a
6-10 day period. After 4 days of treatment, and as the dosage was gradually
increased, the animals exhibited mild motor deficits. These abnormalities slowly 
declined over the following 1-6 week period. In contrast, similar treatment of
common marmosets with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) (1-4
mg/kg i.p.) for 3-5 days in a cumulative dose of 6.9-9.2 mg/kg produced gross
impairment of motor function which persisted throughout the 5 weeks period of
observation. Administration of 2'-methyl-MPTP for 6-10 days caused some decrease 
in dopamine and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), but not homovanillic acid
(HVA) content in the caudate nucleus in animals 5-6 weeks after the start of
treatment. There was a small decrease in [3H]dopamine uptake into putamen
synaptosomes. This contrasted with the marked decreases in all these parameters
observed after MPTP treatment of common marmosets. Histological examination of
the substantia nigra from the four animals treated with 2'-methyl-MPTP did not
show degeneration or loss of dopamine-containing cell bodies in the zona
compacta. In contrast, MPTP caused severe destruction of these pigmented nigral
neurones. In the common marmoset 2'-methyl-MPTP does not appear to show the same 
neurotoxic action as MPTP itself. This contrasts with findings in the mouse where
2'-methyl-MPTP is more toxic to dopamine-containing cells of substantia nigra
than MPTP.

Genetically distinct cell populations in naturally occurring bone marrow-chimeric
primates express similar MHC class I gene products.

The cotton-top tamarin (Saguinus oedipus) is a naturally occurring "A" +
"B"----"A" bone marrow-chimeric species. These primates usually are born as
dizygotic twins and, due to placental vascular anastomoses, develop sharing each 
others' bone marrow elements. Strikingly, almost 50% of the PBL of a member of a 
twin pair are derived from the hematopoietic stem cells of its cotwin. To clarify
the mechanisms underlying the maintenance of tolerance in these stable chimeras, 
MHC gene products have been biochemically characterized in cloned, genetically
distinct, male and female lymphocytes from two male/female cotton-top tamarin
twin pairs. Extensive MHC class II sharing between the genetically distinct cell 
populations was not seen in the two twin pairs. This was consistent with the MHC 
class II polymorphism seen in the species. However, the MHC class I gene products
expressed by one member of a twin pair were almost identical to those expressed
by its cotwin. A human minisatellite probe demonstrated restriction fragment
length polymorphism in DNA from these animals, indicating extensive polymorphism.
Thus, MHC class I sharing did not occur due to inbreeding in these animals.
Additionally, another bone marrow-chimeric primate species, the common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus), expresses MHC class I molecules with low levels of
variation. These studies suggest that the stable chimerism of bone
marrow-chimeric primates may be facilitated by MHC class I similarity between the
genetically distinct bone marrow derived-cell populations in their circulation.

Immunoregulation in the common marmoset, Calithrix jaccus: functional properties

Non-human primates have been used to study immune function to a much lesser
extent than readily available strains of inbred rodents. Nevertheless, in
situations where it might be desirable, but impossible, to study human immune
responses in vivo, lower primates could provide an acceptable alternative. In
order to extent the knowledge of T- and B-lymphocyte function in lower primates, 
the common marmoset Callithrix jaccus was used as an experimental model. The
functional similarities between this species and humans at the level of T-B
co-operation in the antibody response were examined, and xenoreactive
T-lymphocyte clones were obtained from marmoset spleen cells using Epstein-Barr
virus (EBV)-transformed human B cells as stimulators. These clones could act as
helper cells when co-cultured with human B lymphocytes, inducing the secretion of
both IgM and IgG. Lymphokine production by mitogen-stimulated marmoset T-cell
clones was also examined. Interleukins (IL) 2 and 4 activities were detected in
clone supernatants using bioassays and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) was detected 
using a solid-phase ELISA system. However, SDS-PAGE analysis of biosynthetically 
labelled marmoset and human T-cell clone supernatant proteins revealed major
differences between the soluble T-cell products of the two species. The
proliferative responses of marmoset T and B cells to recombinant human IL-2 and
IL-4 were also examined. Stimulation of [3H]thymidine uptake was detected in both
T cell- and anti-IgM-stimulated B-cell cultures with both of the lymphokines.
These results suggests that the key components of the antibody response are
functionally conserved between lower primates and man and that the common
marmoset may be useful as an in vivo model of immune function, particularly with 
regard to the role of interleukins such as IL-2 and IL-4.

Monoclonal antibodies from Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphocytes of common
marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) immune to malaria.

The B lymphocytes of the common marmoset Callithrix jacchus can be immortalized
by infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in vitro (Desgranges et al., 1976). C.
jacchus is susceptible to infection with the blood stages of several species of
malaria parasite including the line designated MVF1 (Mitchell et al., 1988) from 
which it recovers and shows immunity to reinfection. By exploiting these two
phenomena, EBV-transformed, marmoset lymphoblastoid cell lines secreting
antibodies to malaria parasite antigens have been generated and cloned. We
believe this to be the first time that monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) have been
raised from common marmosets. Since numerous and diverse human pathogens can
infect this small primate in the laboratory, these methods may prove generally
applicable for the generation of MAbs whose specificities derive from immune
responses to infection.

Morphology of neuropeptide Y-immunoreactive neurons in the cat olfactory bulb and
olfactory peduncle: postnatal development and species comparison.

The distribution and morphology of Neuropeptide Y-immunoreactive (NPY-ir) neurons
in the olfactory bulb and the olfactory peduncle was studied in the adult cat and
rat, and the common marmoset Callithrix jacchus. Significant species differences 
were not observed. In all three species, the population of NPY-ir neurons is
localized in the white matter extending from the main olfactory bulb to the
border of the striatum. The neurons are characterized by a conspicuously looping 
axonal ramification pattern with some major collaterals running toward the
olfactory bulb and others running toward the internal olfactory tract. The
former, ipsilateral projection terminates in the granule cell layer of the main
and accessory olfactory bulb and in layer II/III of the anterior olfactory
nucleus. Reconstruction of the latter projection has revealed that the fibers are
continuous with the olfactory limb of the anterior commissure and the anterior
commissure proper suggesting a commissural contralateral projection. The analysis
of the postnatal development of the cat NPY neuron system supports this
assumption in a very clear-cut way. In young animals growing fibers are observed 
to cross the brachium of the commissure. The NPY neuron system develops
postnatally. The maximum cell number is reached during the third postnatal week. 
The appearance of more and more NPY-ir neurons slightly precedes the formation of
the terminal fields and of the fiber projection in the internal olfactory tract. 
The density of this early fiber projection by far exceeds the fiber density
observed in the adult. Later in development the fiber density in the olfactory
limb and the anterior commissure becomes considerably reduced. In contrast, the
plexus density in the anterior olfactory nucleus and the granule cell layer of
the main and accessory olfactory bulb undergoes only a slight reduction, and the 
NPY-ir cell number remains roughly constant. These observations suggest that the 
ipsilateral NPY-ir projection remains largely unchanged, in contrast to the
contralateral projection, which exists to a large extent only for the first four 
postnatal months. The observation that the NPY neuron system gives rise to a
contralateral projection does not support a classification of NPY neurons as
short axon cells.

The topology of the thalamo-cortical projections in the marmoset monkey
(Callithrix jacchus).

This paper addresses the question of a general topological principle of
thalamo-cortical projections. In the lissencephalic primate brain of the common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), large injections of horseradish peroxidase were
made in various parts of the neocortex. These injections were placed in different
animals and hemispheres along various caudo-rostral and medio-lateral gradients. 
Labelled cells in the thalamus were plotted and the labelling-zones resulting
from several injections along a medio-lateral and two caudo-rostral cortical
vectors were drawn into semi-schematic thalamic maps. These composite maps reveal
a topological organization of the whole thalamo-cortical projection. The thalamic
representation of the caudo-rostral and medio-lateral gradients indicate a
rotation of the posterior relative to the anterior thalamus. An attempt is made
to relate the organization of the thalamo-cortical projection to the development 
of the thalamus and the cortex. The cortex is divided into concentric zones
around the sensory-motor and insular cortex. The thalamus is divided into
corresponding projection zones. The topology of thalamo-cortical connections can 
then be regarded as a consequence of corresponding thalamic and cortical growth
gradients. This is not only consistent with the general thalamo-cortical topology
and the inversion of maps from thalamus to cortex, but also explains the
continuity and overlap of thalamic projection zones in the pulvinar to widely
separated cortical areas as the parietal, temporal and frontal association
cortex.

The distribution of the collagen types I, III, IV, V, VI and of the glycoprotein 
laminin have been examined in the healthy gingiva of the marmoset with the
indirect immunofluorescence method. It has been shown that collagen type I formed
thick fibrils in a wave-like pattern, while collagen type III formed thinner
fibrils, especially under the epithelial basal membrane. Collagen type IV and
laminin showed a strong fluorescence in the basal membrane (epithelium, vessels, 
nerves). Collagen type V has been demonstrated as a fine fibrillar pattern in the
lamina propria and occasionally close to the basal membrane. Collagen type VI has
been represented as a microfibrillar network in the connective tissue matrix with
a brilliant pericellular fluorescence around vessels and nerves. The study showed
the structural model of the connective tissue matrix of the marmoset gingiva and 
allows a later comparison between inflamed and healthy gingiva.

1. Hydrogen peroxide-induced haemolysis (HPIH) was studied in the red blood cells
of the common marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus) in relation to the composition
of the membrane fatty acids. HPIH (%) was surprisingly high (mean 41% +/- 34;
median 33.4%) and significantly different (P less than 0.001) from the
corresponding value in healthy human subjects (mean 0.98% +/- 0.6; median 1.3%). 
2. It was negatively correlated with 18:2n-6 (r = -0.76, P less than 0.001),
18:2n-6/20:4n-6 (r = -0.70, P less than 0.005) and 18:2n-6/22:6n-3 (r = -0.44, P 
less than 0.025) in the ethanolamine phosphoglycerides of the erythrocytes. 3. A 
shift in the n-6/n-3 balance in favour of the n-3 in the fatty acid composition
of the membrane may have predisposed the red blood cells to haemolysis. 4. An
increase in 22:6n-3, and a decrease of 20:4n-6 and 18:2n-6, may have been the
result of feeding a diet containing fish products rich in long chain n-3 fatty
acids.

The secretion of plasma melatonin exhibits a diurnal variation in the common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus jacchus) (n = 12) with mean values of 125.8 fmol/ml 
during darkness and below assay sensitivity (mean 70.5 fmol/ml) during the light 
period. Both melatonin secretion and the rest activity cycle appeared to be phase
advanced with relation to the light dark cycle which is consistent with an
endogenous circadian period (tau) of less than 24 h in this species.

Medial hypothalamic lesions and sexual receptivity in the female common marmoset 
(Callithrix jacchus).

Dixson AF(1).

Author information: 
(1)MRC Reproductive Biology Unit, Centre for Reproductive Biology, Edinburgh, UK.

Medial hypothalamic lesions cause major deficits in sexual receptivity in a
variety of mammalian species. Effects of such lesions upon sexual receptivity in 
female primates have not been investigated. Two experiments are described in
which thermal lesions were made in the hypothalamus in 11 ovariectomized or
ovariectomized/adrenalectomized, oestradiol-treated common marmosets.
Proceptivity (sexual initiating behaviour) was reduced or abolished by lesions in
the dorsomedial or ventromedial hypothalamus. Sexual receptivity was unaffected
except in 3 females in which damage to the ventromedial area was associated with 
a 25-42% increase in terminations of males' mounts. However, this effect was
reversed by treating females with oestradiol. Therefore, medial hypothalamic
lesions have pronounced effects upon proceptivity in the marmoset, whereas
effects upon receptivity are much less pronounced or absent. These results are
discussed in relation to the evolution of the hormonal control of receptivity in 
anthropoid primates as compared to other mammals.

Desenkephalin-gamma-endorphin is an antagonist of the hyperactivity response

striatum of marmoset.

Author information:

Bradford, West Yorkshire, U.K.

The ability of desenkephalin-gamma-endorphin (DE gamma E; ORG5878) to antagonise 
a raised limbic dopamine function was investigated in the rat and common
marmoset. Dopamine was infused for 13 days directly into the nucleus accumbens of
the rat and ventral striatum of the marmoset and increased locomotor activity.
Such increases in both the rat and marmoset were antagonised by the subcutaneous 
injection of DE gamma E, administered in a range 10-500 micrograms/kg (t.i.d.),
during the 13 day period of infusion of dopamine. Treatment with dopamine alone
or in combination with DE gamma E failed to influence the level of spontaneous
locomotor activity after discontinuing treatment. In contrast, in experiments
performed in the rat, the level of spontaneous locomotor activity was increased
2- to 3-fold after cessation of a regimen of infusion of dopamine and
haloperidol. The increases in activity were antagonised by DE gamma E (50 and 100
micrograms/kg t.i.d., s.c., for 2 days). In additional experiments in the
marmoset, using animals initially selected as "high activity" responders to
challenge with (-)N-n-propylnorapomorphine, the infusion of dopamine caused a
reversal in responsiveness to the stimulant effects of
(-)N-n-propylnorapomorphine on locomotor activity some 2-4 weeks after
discontinuing the infusion of dopamine. The administration of fluphenazine
(0.01-2.5 mg/kg b.d.), during the infusion of dopamine, failed to prevent the
subsequent change in responsiveness to (-)N-n-propylnorapomorphine, whereas a
regimen of dopamine and DE gamma-E (25-100 micrograms/kg t.i.d.) prevented such
changes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

[Article in Japanese]

Doi H, Tsuji Y, et al.

Infection of HTLV-1 during childhood may be the most probable cause of
leukemogenesis of ATL. The possibility of mother to child transmission of HTLV-1 
was studied. Our epidemiological investigation disclosed that almost all mothers 
of HTLV-1 carrier children were positive for anti-HTLV-1 antibody and children
born from carrier mothers showed statistically higher positive rate for
anti-HTLV-1 antibody than control groups. A large number of HTLV-1 positive
lymphocytes were detected in the milk from carrier mother, but not in the cord
blood from newborn babies delivered from carrier mothers. We inoculated the fresh
milk collected from carrier mothers into the oral cavity of a common marmoset to 
prove the oral infection. The marmoset was found to be seroconverted and viral
antigen expression was detected in short term cultures of its peripheral T
lymphocytes. These results suggest that we can prevent the transmission of HTLV-1
by prohibiting the breast-fed [corrected] by carrier mother. We have so far
followed up 55 children born from carrier mothers but fed with compound milk
only. None of the children in this group became a carrier of HTLV-1, whereas
breast-fed group was found to have higher incidence of sero-positivity for
HTLV-1. Therefore the trial prevention of HTLV-1 transmission is now undertaken
in Nagasaki district.

Two systems are described for the collection of 24 h urine samples from the
common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). Using 84 adult animals, 1210 24-h samples
were collected. Mean urinary excretion was 14.4 +/- 7.5 ml/24 h (n = 1210, mean
+/- SD). No differences were observed between sexes (for 52 females, 24 h volume 
= 15.1 +/- 8.0 ml; for 32 males, 24 h volume = 12.5 +/- 6.0 ml). No significant
differences were observed between pregnant and non-pregnant females with respect 
to 24 h urine volume, and bilateral gonadectomy did not influence subsequent
urinary excretion in either sex. For 161 pairs of observations, the intake of
drinking water (11.7 +/- 10.2 ml/24 h) and the volume of urine excreted (12.6 +/-
7.1 ml/24 h) showed a positive correlation (r = 0.406 d.f. 159, P less than
0.001: y = 0.558x + 4.247).

In-vitro data from experiments on rats implicate granulosa cells as primary sites
of hormone-dependent ovarian inhibin biosynthesis, but no equivalent data exist
for primates. We have used the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) to
investigate inhibin biosynthesis in primate granulosa cells in vitro and to
determine its relationship to preovulatory follicular development. To relate the 
production of immunoactive inhibin to follicular maturity, we studied primary
granulosa cell cultures from follicles at progressive stages of preovulatory
development. Granulosa cells from 'large' (greater than or equal to 2.0 mm
diameter) follicles expressed high rates of inhibin production and
steroidogenesis (progesterone), and were positively regulated by human (h)LH in
vitro. Less mature granulosa cells from 'medium' (1.1-1.9 mm) and 'small' (less
than or equal to 1.0 mm) follicles expressed proportionately lower rates of
inhibin production and steroidogenesis, but each parameter was stimulated in a
dose- and time-dependent manner by hFSH in vitro. The stimulatory action of hFSH 
on immunoreactive inhibin was augmented by the presence of testosterone or
oestradiol; testosterone (but not oestradiol) also augmented the steroidogenic
response to hFSH. Marmoset luteal tissue also produced inhibin in vitro and
expressed an approximately 1.5 kb inhibin alpha-subunit mRNA, confirming the
corpus luteum as a source of ovarian inhibin in primates. These results provide
direct experimental evidence that primate granulosa cells produce inhibin. They
suggest that production of inhibin by immature granulosa cells is initially
induced by FSH and subject to modulation by follicular steroids.(ABSTRACT

Milk-borne transmission of HTLV-I as a major route in the endemic cycle.

Hino S.

Mother-to-child transmission of HTLV-I as a major route in the endemic cycle of
HTLV-I was established by epidemiologic evidence that (1) 22% (17/78) of children
of HTLV-I carrier mothers were themselves carriers, in contrast to approximately 
1% of the young age population of the same area, (2) more than 95% (23/24) of
mothers of carrier children were themselves carriers, and (3) the product of the 
prevalence of carrier mothers and the incidence of carriers in children born to
them corresponded well to the prevalence of carrier children in the same area.
Intrauterine infection was not likely, since none of over 200 cord bloods of
babies born to carrier mothers showed infection markers, such as IgM antibody or 
viral antigens. The possibility of milk-borne transmission was supported by (1)
the presence of sufficient numbers of infected T-cells in the milk of carrier
mothers, (2) the fact that a common marmoset was found to be a carrier after oral
administration of the milk of carrier mothers, and (3) a retrospective analysis
which revealed that none of nine babies fed only compound milk were carriers. An 
ongoing intervention study showed that none of 47 babies whose mothers refrained 
from breast feeding had seroconverted at 12 months of age. Compound milk feeding 
by carrier mothers seems to be an effective measure to reduce dramatically the
infection rate of HTLV-I.

Progesterone antagonist lilopristone: a potent abortifacient in the common
marmoset.

The effects of a progesterone antagonist ZK 98.734 (lilopristone) on
implantation, early pregnancy, and midpregnancy were studied in the common
marmoset, Callithrix jacchus jacchus. Treatment (5 mg/da intramuscularly for 3
consecutive days) on day (n = 8) after the midcycle peak in estradiol levels in
mated animals induced a premature drop in plasma progesterone levels and
shortened the ovarian cycle length. Treatment on day 20 (n = 5) or day 40 (n = 5)
induced a drop in progesterone levels and decidual collapse. In three animals
treated on day 40, vaginal bleeding was observed within 46 hours of the
initiation of treatment. Treatment on day 80 resulted in expulsion of the fetuses
with a mean induction abortion interval of 39 hours (range, 20 to 48 hours). The 
progesterone antagonistic effects of ZK 98.734 could be a result of the decrease 
in progesterone synthesis by the corpus luteum and/or placenta in addition to the
interference with the progesterone binding to its cellular receptors in the
target organ. Our study suggests that ZK 98.734 has potential for fertility
regulation. Clinical trials for postcoital contraception, induction of
menstruation, and early abortifacient effects are warranted.

Naloxone reversal of stress-induced suppression of LH release in the common
marmoset.

O'Byrne KT(1), Lunn SF, Dixson AF.

Author information: 
(1)M.R.C. Reproductive Biology Unit, Edinburgh.

There is considerable evidence suggesting that endogenous opioid peptides (EOP)
might play a role in the defensive response to stressful stimuli. The stress
associated with receipt of aggression from a female conspecific and physical
restraint for collection of serial blood samples (at 10-min intervals) resulted
in a significant (p less than 0.05) suppression of LH secretion in the oestradiol
primed ovariectomized marmoset. Administration of the opioid receptor antagonist,
Naloxone (1 mg/kg) immediately before and after receipt of aggression completely 
prevented the stress-induced decrease in LH release. This suggests that EOP may
mediate, at least in part, this stress induced decline in LH release in the
marmoset.

Blockade of the oestrogen-induced LH surge in the ovariectomized common marmoset 
(Callithrix jacchus) by an LHRH antagonist.

O'Byrne KT(1), Lunn SF, Fraser HM.

Author information: 
(1)MRC Reproductive Biology Unit, Centre for Reproductive Biology, Edinburgh, UK.

Six long-term ovariectomized adult marmoset monkeys were treated at 0 h with 35
micrograms oestradiol benzoate s.c. to induce an LH surge. They were also treated
with detirelix (an LHRH antagonist) at 0 h, 12 h and 24 h (Exp. 1), or at 0 h and
24 h (Exp. 2) at a dose of 300 micrograms/kg s.c., or received the detirelix
vehicle alone at 0 h, 12 h and 24 h (Exp. 3). All animals received the three
treatments, with at least 4 weeks between experiments. Blood samples were
collected at 0 h and at 6-12 h intervals for 72 h after oestradiol for the
determination of plasma LH by bioassay. In control animals, oestrogen treatment
resulted in a decline in plasma LH from 30.0 +/- 5.8 at 0 h to 12.8 +/- 2.6 ng/ml
at 6 h (negative feedback), followed by a positive feedback surge, reaching a
maximum of 148.0 +/- 34.6 ng/ml at 24 h. Values then declined to pretreatment
levels by 56 h. In contrast, antagonist-treated animals showed complete abolition
of the expected increase at 24 h, the low levels of the negative feedback phase
being maintained for 36-72 h. These results show that hypothalamic LHRH release
is essential during the oestrogen-induced LH surge, and that a direct
oestrogen-induced component at the pituitary level is not expressed in the
absence of LHRH in the marmoset.

Characteristics of the circadian activity rhythm in common marmosets (Callithrix 
j. jacchus).

Erkert HG(1).

Author information: 
(1)Institut für Biologie III, Universität Tübingen, Tübingen, West Germany.

The circadian activity rhythm of the common marmoset, Callithrix j. jacchus was
investigated by long-term recording of the locomotor activity of 15 individuals
(5 males, 10 females) from 1.5 to 8 years old, both under constant illumination
and under LD 12:12. The mean period of the spontaneous circadian rhythm was 23.2 
± 0.3 h. Neither sex-specific differences nor a systematic influence of light
intensity on the spontaneous period were observed, but the period was dependent
on the duration of the trial and on the age of the individual. Due to the short
spontaneous period, in LD 12:12 there was a distinct advance of the activity
phase with respect to the light time and a masking of the true onset of activity 
by the inhibitory direct effect of low light intensity during the dark time.
After an 8 h delay shift of the LD 12:12, re-entrainment of the circadian
activity rhythm required an average of 6.8 ± 0.7 days; the average re-entrainment
time after an 8 h phase advance of the LD cycle was 8.6 ± 1.3 day. This
directional effect is ascribed to characteristics of the phase-response curve. No
ultradian components were observed, either in the LD-entrained or the
free-running circadian activity rhythm.

Heinz bodies do not modify the membrane characteristics of common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus) erythrocytes.

Omorphos SC(1), Rice-Evans C, Hawkey C.

Medicine, London, UK.

The possibility was examined that the membrane function of erythrocytes obtained 
from healthy common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) was modified by the presence
in the cells of Heinz bodies. No significant differences were found in
erythrocyte endogenous free malonyl dialdehyde (MDA) or reduced glutathione (GSH)
between normal human erythrocytes and marmoset erythrocytes containing Heinz
bodies. Membrane fluorescent chromolipids, surface charge and thiol levels were
similar in both species but average membrane bulk lipid fluidity was slightly
elevated in the marmosets. It was concluded that, in contrast to the situation in
human erythrocytes, the presence of Heinz bodies in red cells of marmosets does
not adversely affect the properties of the membrane.

The evolution and distribution of morphological changes in the nervous system of 
the common marmoset following the acute administration of
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine.

Author information:

Vale, London.

Six young adult marmosets received 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine
in multiple doses (total 8-16 mg/kg over 2-13 days) sufficient to produce a
parkinsonian syndrome and were killed up to 3.5 months later. Cellular changes
were found in the substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area, and hypothalamus. The
earliest histological abnormalities were axonal swellings in proximal parts of
nigrostriatal axons. Subsequent changes in the substantia nigra were reduced
Nissl staining, reduced cell volume, and aggregation and loss of melanin
granules. Other effects were reduced nuclear and nucleolar volumes, depletion of 
cells, and hyperplasia of glial cells. Shrunken cytoplasm and nuclei stained
uniformly with eosin, and no cells showed cytoplasmic swellings or inclusions.
These cellular alterations, with nuclear changes resembling karyolysis, do not
occur in Parkinson's disease, which is characterised by Lewy body inclusions and 
signs of chromatolysis. The rapid appearance of axonal swellings, disruption of
Nissl substance, and cell shrinkage suggest an insult to energy producing
mechanisms. In this study, the absence of histological evidence of toxicity in
the locus coeruleus and also in the substantia innominata and in serotonergic
cell groups is unlike the more widespread degenerative changes of Parkinson's
disease.

Effects of hypothalamic lesions upon the sexual and social behaviour of the male 
common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).

Lloyd SA(1), Dixson AF.

Author information:

U.K.

The sexual and associated behaviour of 10 adult male marmosets was recorded
during pair tests with ovariectomized females, before and after bilateral thermal
lesions of the hypothalamus. Four sham-lesioned males served as controls. Lesions
varied in volume from 1.49 to 3.28 mm3 and extended from the ventromedial
hypothalamus to the diagonal band of Broca. Precopulatory behaviours
(anticipatory erections, tongue flicking and anogenital investigations of the
female) as well as frequencies of mounting, intromission and ejaculation
decreased in lesioned males. The greatest suppression of sexual behaviour
occurred after lesioning the anterior hypothalamus (AH), beneath the anterior
commissure, or at the junction of the AH with the preoptic area (POA). Lesions
confined to the POA had less profound behavioural effects. Treating
ovariectomized females with estradiol stimulated their proceptivity but had no
consistent effects upon the males' behaviour. Lesioned males did not exhibit
signs of social withdrawal and frequencies of allogrooming or grooming
invitations increased post-operatively. Preliminary studies on intermale
aggression indicated that lesions which had the greatest effect upon sexual
behaviour also tended to decrease aggressive interactions with other males.
Hypothalamic lesions did not affect plasma testosterone levels, except in one
male and only one animal showed signs of ill health (weight loss and hypothermia)
post-operatively. These results show that damage to the AH or AH-POA junction in 
male marmosets causes a profound suppression of sexual 'arousal' and copulatory
behaviour and that such affects are not due to androgen insufficiency or other,
non-specific, side effects of neural damage.

Glomerulonephritis in common marmosets infected with Plasmodium brasilianum and
Epstein-Barr virus.

Plasmodium brasilianum causes chronic quartan malaria in the common marmoset
Callithrix jacchus, whereas Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is followed by an 
infectious mononucleosis-like syndrome that resolves. We infected weanling
marmosets with one or both of these pathogens. Timing of the infections
influenced outcome. Six animals were simultaneously infected with both agents;
four became seriously ill (with accompanying proteinuria and edema) and either
died or were killed. Histopathology indicated that glomerulonephritis had
developed. The two survivors had more-prolonged parasitemia than did animals
infected with P. brasilianum alone, as did animals infected with EBV before P.
brasilianum. Five of the six simultaneously infected animals had absent or low
titers of antibody to Epstein-Barr viral capsid antigens when compared with the
other EBV-infected animals. Our results suggest that combined infection may be
part of the etiology of quartan malarial nephropathy.

Common marmosets were treated daily with
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP, 7-9 mg/kg i.p.) for 25 days, 
and then kept out of drug for three months before biochemical measurements in
various brain areas. This treatment induced a dramatic fall (-80%) in dopamine,
homovanillic acid and dihydroxyphenylacetic acid levels in the putamen and
caudate nucleus, and a significant but less pronounced reduction (less than or
equal to 50%) in the levels of these compounds in the nucleus accumbens. In
contrast, the concentrations of four neuropeptides: met-enkephalin,
leu-enkephalin, substance P, and cholecystokinin, remained unaltered in all brain
areas examined in MPTP-treated marmosets. Therefore the neuropeptide alterations 
previously reported in Parkinson's disease are probably not secondary to the
severe lesion of dopaminergic neurones, but constitute another intrinsic feature 
of the disease.

Effects of acute stress on the patterns of LH secretion in the common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus).

O'Byrne KT(1), Lunn SF, Dixson AF.

Author information: 
(1)MRC Reproductive Biology Unit, Centre for Reproductive Biology, Edinburgh.

Stressful stimuli associated with aggressive encounters and low social rank may
affect female fertility in a variety of mammalian species. In these experiments
we examined the effects of aggressive encounters and physical restraint in a
primate chair on the patterns of LH secretion in ovariectomized, oestrogen-primed
female marmosets. Receipt of aggression from a female conspecific, followed by
physical restraint for collection of blood samples (at 10-min intervals for 4 h),
resulted in marked declines in LH concentrations during oestradiol-induced LH
surges in five animals (from 112 +/- 24 micrograms/l to 45 +/- 12 micrograms/l;
group means +/- S.E.M.; P less than 0.05). This was due to reductions in LH pulse
amplitude rather than to changes in pulse frequency. Decreases in plasma
concentrations of LH were reversed by treating females with exogenous
LH-releasing hormone (LHRH). Cortisol treatment had no effect on LH levels during
oestrogen-induced LH surges. Effects of aggressive encounters and physical
restraint on plasma LH were not therefore due to reduced pituitary responsiveness
to LHRH or to increased plasma concentrations of cortisol. In separate
experiments it was found that physical restraint alone had no effect on plasma LH
in habituated subjects, and that decreases in plasma LH after receipt of
aggression only occurred if animals were subsequently placed in the restraint
chair. A summation of stressful effects is therefore required to produce the fall
in circulating LH. A summation of social and other environmental stressors may
also underlie the reduced fertility seen in free-living animals.

Distribution and some projections of cholinergic neurons in the brain of the
common marmoset, Callithrix jacchus.

(1)Department of Anatomy, University of Cambridge, England.

The distribution of choline acetyltransferase-immunoreactive (ChAT-IR) neurons
was studied in the brain of the common marmoset by using immunohistochemistry.
ChAT-IR neurons were found in the medial septal nucleus, vertical and horizontal 
limb nuclei of the diagonal band, the nucleus basalis of Meynert,
pedunculopontine nucleus and laterodorsal tegmental nucleus, and also in the
striatum, habenula, and brainstem cranial nerve motor nuclei. The organization of
ChAT-IR neurons in the basal forebrain, midbrain, and pons is consistent with the
Ch1-Ch6 nomenclature introduced by Mesulam et al. ('83). The combination of the
retrograde transport of HRP-WGA with ChAT immunohistochemistry revealed the
distribution of neurons in the Ch4 cell group projecting to the dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex. The activity of ChAT was highest in limbic cortical
structures, such as the hippocampus, and lowest in association areas of the
neocortex. Lesions at various loci in the basal forebrain resulted in
differential patterns of ChAT loss in the cortex, which suggests some degree of
topographical organization of Ch4 projections to the cortical mantle.

Cellular aspects of pre-ovulatory folliculogenesis in primate ovaries.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University of Edinburgh Centre for
Reproductive Biology, UK.

According to current concepts of pre-ovulatory folliculogenesis in primate
ovaries, each growing follicle has a 'threshold' requirement for stimulation by
FSH which must be met if it is to enter the oestrogen-secretory phase of
pre-ovulatory development. Until recently, our understanding of the
intra-follicular mechanisms underlying FSH action on granulosa cells was based
largely on information from non-primate laboratory animals, mainly polyovulators 
such as rats. The present paper describes studies on FSH-regulated granulosa cell
function in relation to pre-ovulatory development in vivo and in vitro using a
laboratory primate, the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). Measurement of
aromatase activity is used as an index of granulosa cell cytodifferentiation to
verify three major tenets of the 'threshold' hypothesis: (i) that granulosa cells
acquire increased responsiveness to FSH and LH during pre-ovulatory growth; (ii) 
that these developmentally related changes are directly induced by FSH; and (iii)
that intrafollicular steroids modify FSH action and thereby contribute to the
establishment of follicular FSH thresholds. The results obtained highlight the
value of this experimental animal model for studies of cellular and molecular
aspects of pre-ovulatory folliculogenesis which are relevant to human ovaries.

Effect of antiprogestin ZK 98.734 on the ovarian cycle, early pregnancy, and on

jacchus.

The antiprogestin ZK 98.734 (11 beta-(4-dimethylaminophenyl-17 beta-hydroxy-17
alpha-(3-hydroxy-prop-1(Z)-enyl-4,9(10)-estradien-3-one) was administered i.m. (5
mg/day) for three consecutive days to two groups of common marmosets. In one
group (nonpregnant, n = 6), it was injected during the luteal phase, and to the
second group (pregnant, n = 7), it was injected during early pregnancy, on Days
24-26 of the mid-cycle estradiol peak. Administration of ZK 98.734 during the
luteal phase caused a sharp drop in plasma progesterone levels. The luteal phase 
was shortened whether the drug was administered during the early or the late
luteal phase. Similarly, administration of ZK 98.734 during early pregnancy
caused a significant drop in progesterone levels, and pregnancy was terminated in
all of the animals. The post-treatment cycles in both groups of animals were
ovulatory and of normal duration. 3H-ZK 98.734 showed specific binding to
myometrial cytosol fraction. ZK 98.734 also displaced the binding of
3H-progesterone to progesterone receptors. However, progesterone had higher
binding affinity than did ZK 98.734. The antifertility action of ZK 98.734 could 
be a result either of its luteolytic action or of its blocking the progesterone
receptors in the target tissue. This study, therefore, indicates that in the
common marmoset ZK 98.734 is a progesterone antagonist with a potential to
terminate early pregnancy.

Plasmodium vivax malaria in the common marmoset, Callithrix jacchus: adaptation
and host response to infection.

Infection with Plasmodium vivax was established in splenectomized Callithrix
jacchus marmosets by inoculation of parasitized blood from Aotus trivirgatus
carrying the Vietnam Palo-Alto line of P. vivax. Subsequent blood passage through
intact marmosets resulted in higher peak parasitaemias (about 1% of red cells
infected) and the loss of stainable Schüffner's dots in infected cells. Primary
infections with the adapted line were patent for 74 days or more, and induced
both a substantial antibody response, as determined by indirect fluorescence, and
some lymphocytosis, but no marked anaemia. Marmosets which had recovered from
their primary infection (or in which it was drug-cured) suffered abbreviated
patency with low-grade parasitaemia on re-infection.

Endogenous N-excretion and minimal protein requirement for maintenance of the
common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).

Author information:

Germany.

The protein requirement for maintenance of the marmoset Callithrix jacchus was
investigated by factorial calculation via the N balance technique. Six adult male
marmosets were fed a protein-free pelleted diet for 22 days. When a low protein
diet (6%) was fed in the preperiod, only 7 days were necessary and when fed a
higher protein diet (18%) 10 days were necessary to reach a minimum of N
excretion during protein depletion. Body weight losses averaged 11% and food
intake was 21% lower in the protein free period. The average endogenous urine N
(EUN) was 62.1 mg N and endogenous fecal N (EFN) 49.2 mg N/kg W0.75. Body surface
losses (BSN) were assumed to be 20 mg N/kg W0.75. The total endogenous loss of
131.3 mg N/kg W0.75 is similar to that of other species. Net protein utilization 
(NPU) of well balanced proteins, determined near the N equilibrium, was 51.8%.
The calculated net protein requirement amounts to 313.6 mg N/kg W0.75, which
corresponds to a dietary protein content of 6% in a diet of high caloric density,
(about 19-20 MJ/kg dry matter) when the food intake is 3.3% of body weight.

Expression of C-type viral particles at implantation in the marmoset monkey.

Author information:

UK.

Type C RNA retroviral particles have been observed budding from the plasma
membrane of syncytiotrophoblast during a study of embryo implantation in the
common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). These viral particles appear in profusion
at the interface of syncytiotrophoblast with cytotrophoblast. They appear to be a
non-infective, endogenous viral component of the host genome, although the
precise role of the C-type virus in this context is unclear at present. Such
viral particles have been reported previously from studies of human term
placenta; however, this is the first report indicating that expression of viral
particles occurs at the earliest stages of embryo implantation.

The afferent and efferent connections of the primary auditory cortex (AI) of
common marmosets were traced following small injections of wheat germ agglutinin 
conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) made at best frequency
(BF)-defined sites in the AI. After the injections the animals remained
anesthetized for 15-23 hours; they were then perfused transcardially with
fixative and the brains were processed for WGA-HRP reaction product. Examination 
of the disposition of labelled material revealed the following results. First,
patches of terminal labelling, and to a lesser extent retrograde labelling, were 
found outside the injection site in the ipsilateral cortex rostral and caudal to 
the AI. Second, the region of the contralateral cortex corresponding to the
injection site contained labelled terminals throughout the depth of the cortex;
labelled neurons were found in the middle layers. Third, in each experiment a
discrete region of the medial geniculate body (MG) contained retrogradely
labelled neurons interspersed with anterogradely labelled terminals. These
regions had a banded appearance, were found in the dorsal and rostral half of the
MG, and shifted in location progressively dorsalward as the injection site BF
increased. The presence of projection zones rostral and caudal to the AI of
marmosets, and the disposition of the MG sources of projection in relation to BF,
are similar to observations made on other New World monkeys. The ipsilateral
corticocortical projections confirm electrophysiological evidence suggesting the 
existence of auditory fields rostral and caudal to the AI. The thalamocortical
auditory system of the marmoset appears relatively simple, with a comparatively
undifferentiated MG projecting to a cortical auditory system dominated by a large
AI.

Herpesvirus ateles immortalizes in vitro a CD3+CD4+CD8+ marmoset lymphocyte with 
NK function.

Herpesvirus ateles, nonpathogenic in its natural host, the spider monkey, induces
a fatal lymphoproliferative syndrome in a variety of New World primate species.
Whereas the closely related New World primate virus Herpesvirus saimiri
immortalizes in vitro common marmoset lymphocytes that express a TCR and
phenotypically are CD4-CD8+NKH1+, we now show that H. ateles-immortalized
marmoset lymphocytes are CD3+ and CD4+. Furthermore, these CD4+ lymphocytes
coexpress CD8 and NKH1. The NK function of cloned H. ateles-immortalized
lymphocyte populations is proportional to the extent to which they express the
CD8 antigen. These studies illustrate an interesting example of restricted viral 
tropism and may indicate a potentially useful means of generating phenotypically 
stable, functionally competent, cloned lymphocyte populations for study.

An immunohistochemical study of the acute and long-term effects of
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine in the marmoset.

Author information:

Administration of the drug 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine induces a
parkinsonian syndrome in primates. Intraperitoneal injections of
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine in the common marmoset (Callithrix
jacchus) produced symptoms of rigidity, akinesia and tremor which persisted for
at least one month. However, after this time, considerable behavioural recovery
occurred, although animals were still severely bradykinetic compared with
controls. Marmosets were allowed to survive for 1, 3 1/2 or 7 months prior to
histological and immunocytochemical analysis. Detection of catecholaminergic
neurons using antibodies directed against the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase
revealed a profound (80%) loss of dopaminergic cells from the substantia nigra
one month after initiation of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine
treatment. This was accompanied by a severe gliosis. Fewer cells were lost from
the adjacent ventral tegmental area (45%), but dopamine-containing cells in other
brain areas were not obviously affected. At longer survival times the substantia 
nigra was less damaged, with a proliferation of glia in the pars compacta and a
loss of approximately 20% of the dopaminergic perikarya. Using
immunohistochemical techniques, the distribution of neuropeptides substance P,
[Met]enkephalin and dynorphin 1-17-like immunoreactivity were examined and found 
to exhibit distinctive patterns in the marmoset substantia nigra. The integrity
of these systems appeared intact at all times after
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine treatment. These results support the
hypothesis that the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine
produces a clinical syndrome, indistinguishable from Parkinson's disease, via a
selective destruction only of neurons with perikarya in the substantia nigra pars
compacta and the ventral tegmental area. The findings that the peptidergic input 
to these cells together with most non-nigral dopaminergic cell groups are not
damaged, indicate that the selectivity of the lesion produced by
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine appears greater than that seen in
idiopathic Parkinson's disease. The neurotoxic effects of
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine in the marmoset may not be permanent
since both behavioural and biochemical recovery were observed after several
months.

Successful infection of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) with human
varicella-zoster virus.

Provost PJ, Keller PM, Banker FS, Keech BJ, Klein HJ, Lowe RS, Morton DH, Phelps 
AH, McAleer WJ, Ellis RW.

The common marmoset, Callithrix jacchus, can be infected with human
varicella-zoster virus (VZV), both wild-type strain KMcC and attenuated vaccine
strain Oka/Merck. Infection was accomplished with either whole-cell-associated or
cell extract VZV by combined oral-nasal-conjunctival application and was
characterized by substantial and persistent anti-VZV antibody responses. The
infectivity of VZV for marmosets was destroyed by treatment of inocula with heat 
or UV light. Diluted inocula with as few as 40 PFU/ml were infectious for
marmosets. The lungs were demonstrated to be a major site of viral replication;
both the presence of viral antigens and signs of pneumonia were demonstrated in
lung tissues. Four serial passages of VZV KMcC were carried out in C. jacchus by 
a process of in vitro isolation and culturing of VZV from infected lung tissue
and reapplication of the cultured isolates to fresh animals. The isolated viruses
were identified as VZV both serologically and by restriction endonuclease
analyses. The C. jacchus infectivity model should prove useful for determining
the efficacy of subunit and live recombinant VZV vaccines as well as for the
study of zoster.

Behavioural consequences of the infusion of dopamine into the nucleus accumbens
of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).

Marmosets, shown to have comparable levels of spontaneous locomotor activity,
assessed in cages equipped with infra-red photocell units, could be separated
into "high", "moderate" and "low activity" responders on the basis of their
locomotor hyperactivity response to peripherally administered
(-)N-n-propylnorapomorphine [(-)NPA]. Animals selected as "low" and "high
activity" responders to (-)NPA were subjected to chronic infusion of dopamine, or
its solvent, bilaterally into the nucleus accumbens for 13 days through Alzet
osmotic minipumps. Both "low" and "high activity" responders exhibited an
increased locomotor activity which peaked on days 6-7 of the infusion. This
hyperactivity, caused by infusion of dopamine was antagonised by small doses of
sulpiride and fluphenazine. After the infusion, the level of spontaneous
locomotor activity of the marmosets was unchanged from pre-infusion values.
However, 2-3 weeks after discontinuing the infusion, the animals initially
classified as "low activity" responders showed markedly enhanced activity when
challenged with (-)NPA, and conversely, animals initially classified as "high
activity" responders showed a reduced responsiveness to (-)NPA. It is concluded
that the consequences of a persistent increase in the activity of dopamine in the
nucleus accumbens of the brain of the marmoset are to (a) enhance locomotor
activity during infusion and (b) after discontinuing infusion, to modify the
locomotor responsiveness to challenge with a dopamine agonist, with the direction
of the change dependent on the initial basal locomotor responsiveness to (-)NPA.

The influence of linoleate and vitamin E from sunflower seed oil on platelet
function and prostaglandin production in the common marmoset monkey.

McIntosh GH(1), Bulman FH, Looker JW, Russell GR, James M.

Author information: 
(1)CSIRO Division of Human Nutrition, Adelaide, Australia.

Vitamin E and linoleate, both of which are found in high concentrations in
sunflower seed oil, were examined independently for their influence on general
and blood-vascular parameters in vitamin E-deficient common marmosets. A vitamin 
E-deficient diet (-E, 4 micrograms/g) was supplemented with either 40
micrograms/g vitamin E (+E), vitamin E stripped sunflower oil (+10% SSO-E), or
SSO (+10% SSO w/w) in a 2 x 2 factorial designed experiment, and the diets fed
for 9 months to 4 even groups of common marmosets. Vitamin E deficiency was
associated in marmosets with a loss of skeletal muscle mass and of body weight,
enhanced peroxidative haemolysis of erythrocytes, increased white blood cell
counts, and in the SSO-E group a relative neutrophilia. Platelet reactivity was
increased with vitamin E deficiency, and to a greater degree with the SSO-E
group. Aortic prostacyclin production was significantly increased by the addition
of vitamin E, linoleate and both as SSO to the deficient diet, the effects being 
additive. Fatty acid changes associated with the different treatments reflected
the influence of high linoleate and vitamin E treatments. The platelet and aortic
arachidonate value in the SSO-E group showed the lowest and most variable value, 
and this was associated with greatest platelet aggregability. An adequate vitamin
E intake is essential for stabilising high PUFA diets and biomembranes and
enhancing the protective role of prostacyclin in blood vessels against
thrombogenesis.

Characteristics of trophoblastic tissue derived from in vitro culture of
preimplantation embryos of the common marmoset monkey.

Summers PM(1), Taylor CT, Hearn JP.

Author information: 
(1)MRC/AFRC Comparative Physiology Research Group, Institute of Zoology, London, 
UK.

The features of trophoblastic tissue derived from the in vitro culture of
marmoset monkey embryos have been described. Long-term trophoblast cultures (in
excess of three years in one case) were established from the primary trophoblast 
monolayer of four of 38 embryos; division of one of these embryos produced two
long-term cultures. The trophoblast cells retained their ability to synthesize
and secrete chorionic gonadotrophin (CG) during maintenance in vitro and were
capable of prolonging the luteal phase when transferred to the uterus of
marmosets. A characteristic feature of the cultures was the formation of multiple
fluid-filled vesicles enclosed by a single layer of cytotrophoblast cells and
attached to the culture dish by a small monolayer of syncytiotrophoblast cells.
The tissue was propagated by cutting vesicles into small pieces and placing into 
a fresh culture dish; attempts to subculture using single-cell suspensions were
unsuccessful. These cultures provide a convenient source of marmoset CG for
purification as well as an in vitro system for studying other secretory products 
of primate trophoblast.

Park, London, U.K.

A biologically active gonadotrophin has been purified from the media of long-term
cultures of trophoblast cells of the common marmoset monkey by a combination of
precipitation and chromatography. Marmoset chorionic gonadotrophin (CG) is a
glycoprotein which binds Concanavalin A and wheat germ agglutinin. The protein
purified from culture media exists as several isoelectric species with pI in the 
range pH 3.5-4.5. On gel filtration it eluted with an apparent molecular weight
of 68-72,000 but on PAGE migrated as if it was 58-65,000. A glycoprotein with
similar characteristics has been recovered from plasma samples of pregnant
marmosets. Biological activity of partly purified CG from media, as determined by
a mouse testicular cell bioassay, was 1-3 i.u./mg protein.

Localization of neurotensin receptors in the forebrain of the common marmoset and
the effects of treatment with the neurotoxin
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine.

Waters CM, Hunt SP, Jenner P, Marsden CD.

The distribution of neurotensin binding sites was mapped in the brain of the
common marmoset using [3H]neurotensin as the ligand. Autoradiographic techniques 
show that the density of receptors is particularly high in the substantia nigra, 
ventral tegmental area, olfactory tubercle and cerebral cortex and that the
distribution of neurotensin receptors in the cerebral cortex and striatum is
heterogenous. In the cerebral cortex neurotensin receptors are concentrated in
layers I, II, III and V, whilst receptor density is generally less in all layers 
of middle temporal cortex. Striatal neurotensin receptors conformed to a
striosomal distribution as defined by acetylcholinesterase staining with the
highest density of binding sites in the matrix. The neurotoxin
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine selectively destroyed over 80% of
the dopaminergic neurons of the marmoset substantia nigra and almost 60% of those
in the adjacent ventral tegmental area. The subsequent loss of a large proportion
of neurotensin receptors from marmoset substantia nigra and striatum suggests
their presence on the dopaminergic nigrostriatal pathway.

The measurement of ethylenethiourea and ethyleneurea in the rat and common
marmoset Callithrix jacchus after zineb (zinc ethylenebisdithiocarbamate) dosing.

Searle AJ, Stewart AC, Paul M.

The metabolism of the fungicide zineb, (zinc ethylenebisdithiocarbamate), has
been studied in the rat and the marmoset. 2. It was found in both species that a 
relatively large proportion (21-22%) of the original zineb administered was
detectable in the excreta as ethylenethiourea (ETU) a known mutagen, teratogen
and carcinogen. 3. A further proportion (2-5%) was determined to be ethyleneurea 
which is a metabolite of ETU. 4. Results of comparative experiments in marmosets 
revealed that ETU was photolabile in the presence of excreta, thus showing the
importance of conducting the studies in the dark.

Radionuclide angiographic study of the influence of dietary lipid supplements on

Australia.

Radionuclide angiography was used to examine the influence of dietary fat on
cardiac function in the common marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus jacchus) under
barbiturate anaesthesia. Animals were fed for 6-8 months with a low fat (4.5%)
reference diet or the same diet supplemented (12%) with sunflower seed oil or
sheep fat. Although there was a tendency towards increased heart rate, left
ventricular ejection fraction, peak ejection rate, and peak filling rate in both 
fat supplemented groups, significant increases in heart rate (+50%), peak
ejection rate (+71%), and peak filling rate (+84%) were found with sheep fat
supplementation, whereas only the vegetable oil supplement produced a significant
improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction (+23%). There were no
differences in resting blood pressure, and the main consequence of dietary fat
supplementation was a major increase in apparent cardiac oxygen consumption
(+58%) with the sheet fat diet, as determined by the pressure-rate index.
Infusion of isoprenaline hydrochloride (0.2 microgram.kg-1.min-1) increased all
indices of cardiac function towards common maxima. There were no differences in
either the depth or duration of anaesthesia between dietary groups. It therefore 
is unlikely that this contributed to any of the observed dietary induced
differences in cardiac function. It is suggested that dietary saturated animal
fat increased cardiac work and oxygen consumption at rest to the extent that
functional reserve to respond to stress was significantly diminished. Feeding a
linoleic acid rich polyunsaturated vegetable oil supplement was, however,
accompanied by evidence of some improvement in left ventricular ejection
fraction.

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) can be obtained routinely from the common marmoset

this method is applied is the detection of changes in the biogenic amine
metabolism in CSF. The puncture technique is simple and rapid and does not injure

Influence of dietary fats on blood coagulation and prostaglandin production in
the common marmoset.

McIntosh GH, McMurchie EJ, James M, Lawson CA, Bulman FH, Charnock JS.

Common marmosets were fed a standard marmoset diet (REF) or diets supplemented
with 12% (wt/wt) sunflower seed oil (SSO) or sheep fat (SF) for a period of 90
weeks. The values for coagulation indices, clotting time, and Russel viper venom 
time were consistent with decreased thrombotic tendency of platelets from animals
on the SSO diet relative to the low fat, REF diet animals, while an increased
tendency to thrombosis was observed with SF-fed marmosets. The SSO- and
SF-supplemented marmosets showed a significantly reduced thromboxane (TXB2)
generation from platelets aggregating to collagen (ASC) relative to the REF
group, while at 50 micrograms/ml ASC this difference was maintained only by the
SSO group. The SF diet-fed marmosets showed a reduced prostacyclin (measured as
6-keto-PGF1 alpha) generation from incubated aorta relative to the REF or SSO-fed
groups, which were not different from each other. A reduced proportion of
platelet phospholipid arachidonic acid (20:4, n-6) and increased alpha-tocopherol
concentration was consistent with the decreased aggregability and thromboxane
generation of platelets from SSO-fed marmosets relative to the REF and SF groups.
The SF diet-fed marmosets, on the other hand, showed minimal change in
arachidonic acid, alpha-tocopherol or platelet reactivity from the REF group.
These differing responses to dietary fats are discussed in relation to the
potential for the development of thrombosis and atherosclerosis.

The effects of cryopreservation and transfer on embryonic development in the
common marmoset monkey, Callithrix jacchus.

Summers PM, Shephard AM, Taylor CT, Hearn JP.

Embryos were collected at the 4-10-cell stage from the oviducts (Day 4; Day 1 =
ovulation) or as morulae (Day 7) from the uterus of marmosets and frozen in 1.5
M-DMSO (Days 4 and 7) or 1.0 M-glycerol (Day 4 only), using a slow freezing and
thawing technique. Of 22 Day-4 embryos frozen in DMSO, 18 were recovered and 16
of these were transferred to 10 synchronized recipients; 7 recipients became
pregnant compared with all 7 control recipients receiving 10 unfrozen embryos.
Fifteen frozen-thawed morulae were transferred to 9 Day-6 recipients; the
pregnancy rate (55.6%) was lower than for control embryos (85.7%). Embryos frozen
in glycerol suffered severe osmotic stress during glycerol addition and removal. 
Of 8 recipients, 3 (37.5%) became pregnant but only one fetus was carried to
term. These results on embryo collection, freezing and transfer in the marmoset
have important implications for developing improved methods for freezing human
embryos and the breeding of endangered primates.

Eley RM, Summers PM, Hearn JP.

The prostaglandin F2 alpha analogue, cloprostenol, which is an effective
luteolytic agent in the common marmoset, was administered intramuscularly to
olive baboons to determine if it possessed luteolytic properties in this species.
The results showed that functional luteolysis was not induced when cloprostenol
was administered during the mid- to late luteal phase or during early pregnancy.

Rats and marmosets respond differently to serotonin agonists and antagonists.

Campos MF, Rodrigues F das C.

The actions of the serotonin precursor 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), the agonist
5-methoxy-N,N-dimetyltryptamine (MeODMT) and quipazine (QPZ) and the antagonists 
cyproheptadine, methysergide and metergoline, were studied in the rat and in the 
common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). The precursor and agonists elicited head
shakes, forepaw padding, splayed hindlimbs, tremor and Straub tail in the rat.
However, head shakes were not observed after MeODMT and Straub tail was not
observed after QPZ. Carbidopa plus 5-HTP potentiated only head shakes, while
tranylcypromine (TCP) plus 5-HTP potentiated all the behaviors above. In the
marmoset, the action of these drugs elicited drowsiness, teeth chattering,
ataxia, vomiting and decreased motor activity, although vomiting was not elicited
by MeODMT and ataxia and drowsiness by QPZ. Although TCP plus 5-HTP potentiated
all these behaviors, carbidopa plus 5-HTP was not effective. Rats treated with
the antagonists (1.0, 5.0 and 10 mg/kg doses) did not show any of these
behaviors, but marmosets treated with the same drugs developed "drowsiness",
vomiting, and decreased motor activity; nonetheless, cyproheptadine (5.0 and 10
mg/kg doses) did not elicit "drowsiness", while increasing motor activity and the
number of head shakes. Pretreatment of marmosets with these antagonists blocked
only teeth chattering elicited by MeODMT (4.0 mg/kg) and QPZ (10 mg/kg).
Pretreatment with haloperidol, p-chlorophenylalanine and alpha-methyl-P-tyrosine 
had no effect. The data obtained show that rats and marmosets present
differential behavioral responses to the 5-HT drugs used.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT

Ascorbic acid requirement and assessment of ascorbate status in the common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).

Flurer CI, Kern M, Rambeck WA, Zucker H.

Marmosets can tolerate an ascorbic acid (AA) deficiency for several weeks without
clinical symptoms. After being fed an AA-free diet for 3 months, nonspecific
deficiency symptoms became obvious. Different dietary levels of AA resulted in
corresponding serum ascorbate levels. The kidney threshold of AA in marmosets is 
comparable to that in humans. When the minimal AA requirement is defined as the
amount that is necessary to maintain a serum AA level above the kidney threshold,
then about 20 mg AA/kg body weight is needed. This intake was achieved in our
trial with a diet containing 500 ppm AA. Thus, the AA requirement of marmosets is
severalfold higher than the AA requirement of humans.

Author information: 
(1)University Department of Neurology, Institute of Psychiatry, Denmark Hill,
London, England.

Administration of MPTP (1-4 mg/kg ip daily for 5-7 days) to common marmosets
induced persistent parkinsonian motor deficits. The subcutaneous administration
of (+)-PHNO [(+)-4-propyl-9-hydroxynaphthoxazine; 1-4 micrograms/kg] caused a
dose-dependent reversal of the akinesia and incoordination of movement.
Similarly, oral administration of (+)-PHNO (5-20 micrograms/kg) caused an
equivalent reversal of the motor abnormalities. No dyskinetic phenomena were
induced by (+)-PHNO on oral or subcutaneous administration. Oral or subcutaneous 
administration of (+)-PHNO to normal control marmosets also increased the usual
repetoire of motor behaviour, but this was not as marked as in MPTP-treated
animals. (+)-PHNO is a potent dopamine agonist drug of potential use in the
treatment of Parkinson's disease.

Effects of variable linoleate intake on aortic PGI2-like activity and fatty acid 
composition: difference between rat and marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).

Abeywardena MY, McLennan PL, Charnock JS.

Two animal species, the laboratory rat and a non-human primate (the common
marmoset) were compared with respect to the influence of dietary lipid
supplementation on both fatty acid composition and prostanoid synthetic capacity 
of aorta. Standard chow (REF. diet) was supplemented (12% w/w) with either sheep 
fat (SF) or sunflower seed oil (SSO). Differences were apparent in the aortic
phospholipid fatty acids from both animal models, as a result of the diet,
although the type and the extent of changes displayed a considerable species
variation. For example, after the SSO diet, the proportion of linoleic acid in
rat aorta displayed only a modest increase whilst in marmosets it was doubled. No
change was apparent in the proportion of arachidonic acid in rats, whereas the
marmosets showed a reduction (P less than 0.05) with both lipid supplements. Rats
fed the SF diet showed a considerable increase in aortic PGI2-like activity
compared to REF. And SSO supplemented groups. In contrast, no dietary induced
changes were observed in the aorta from marmosets despite compositional changes. 
The results indicate no direct association between the synthesis of PGI2-like
activity and membrane lipids and demonstrate the need for careful selection of
the proper animal model, particularly in nutritionally orientated experiments.

Lack of change in basal ganglia neuropeptide content following subacute
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine treatment of the common marmoset.

Jenner P, Taquet H, Mauborgne A, Benoliel JT, Cesselin F, Rose S, Javoy-Agid F,
Agid Y, Marsden CD.

Treatment of common marmosets with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine
(MPTP; 1-4 mg/kg for up to 4 days) caused a profound parkinsonian state. Ten days
from the start of MPTP treatment, all animals showed marked motor impairment,
consisting of bradykinesia and akinesia, limb rigidity, postural abnormalities,
loss of vocalisation and blink reflex, and, on occasions, postural tremor.
Measurement of caudate-putamen monoamine content at this time showed a profound
loss in 3,4-dihydroxyphenylethylamine, homovanillic acid, and
3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid concentrations. Measurement of neuropeptide
concentrations in the caudate-putamen, internal and external segments of the
globus pallidus, nucleus accumbens, substantia nigra, frontal cortex, and
hippocampus showed met-enkephalin, leu-enkephalin, and cholecystokinin (CCK-8)
concentrations to be unaffected by MPTP treatment. There was a small decrease in 
the substance P content of frontal cortex, but otherwise the content of this
neuropeptide was unaltered. Parkinsonism in the marmoset, induced by MPTP
treatment 10 days earlier, does not alter neuropeptide concentrations in the
manner observed in Parkinson's disease.

Frequency representation in auditory cortex of the common marmoset (Callithrix
jacchus jacchus).

Aitkin LM, Merzenich MM, Irvine DR, Clarey JC, Nelson JE.

The location and characteristics of the primary auditory cortex of the common
marmoset, Callithrix jacchus jacchus, were determined in five anesthetized male
adult animals by mapping the responses of cortical units and unit clusters to
pure tone stimuli presented to the contralateral ear. The primary auditory cortex
lies largely ventral to the lateral sulcus, the only major fissure on the lateral
cortex of this smooth-brained primate, but in some animals it may extend
significantly down the ventral bank of this sulcus. Responses are distributed
such that low best frequencies are found rostroventrally whereas high best
frequencies occur caudally. The disposition of frequency-band contours is
fan-shaped, with contours separating low-frequency octaves nearly parallel to the
lateral sulcus and high-frequency (greater than 8 kHz) contours perpendicular to 
that sulcus. Best frequencies range from 0.6 to 30 kHz across the primary field, 
but there is a disproportionate representation of the three octaves between 2 and
16 kHz. The most sensitive thresholds (as low as -2 dB SPL) are found between 7
and 9 kHz. The primary auditory cortex is similar in cytoarchitecture to that
reported for the cat, showing a blurring of lamination in the middle layers
(II-IV) and a preponderance of small cells in these merged layers, giving a
highly granular appearance. The accessibility of the cochlear representation on
the gyral surface makes the marmoset an attractive animal for studies of primate 
auditory cortex.

Herpesvirus saimiri strain 11 immortalizes a restricted marmoset T8 lymphocyte
subpopulation in vitro.

Kiyotaki M, Desrosiers RC, Letvin NL.

Herpesvirus saimiri induces a fatal lymphoproliferative syndrome in a variety of 
New World primate species. We now show that cell lines derived from PBL of the
common marmoset by in vitro-immortalization with H. saimiri strain 11 represent a
remarkably restricted lymphocyte population. These cell lines have NK cell
function, phenotypically express both suppressor/cytotoxic (T8) and NK cell
(NKH1)-associated antigens, and express a T cell receptor. This subpopulation of 
lymphocytes is a very minor population of cells in the peripheral blood of common
marmosets (less than or equal to 3%). The specificity in the interaction between 
H. saimiri strain 11 and a subpopulation of common marmoset lymphocytes
represents an example of a restricted viral lymphotropism and may have important 
implications for the disease induced by this virus in New World monkeys.

Bone in the marmoset: a resemblance to vitamin D-dependent rickets, type II.

Yamaguchi A, Kohno Y, Yamazaki T, Takahashi N, Shinki T, Horiuchi N, Suda T,
Koizumi H, Tanioka Y, Yoshiki S.

The common marmoset, a New World monkey, requires a large amount of vitamin D3 to
maintain its normal growth. This monkey is reported to have an end-organ
resistance to 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1 alpha,25(OH)2D3). In this study, 
the bone morphology of marmosets fed a high vitamin D3 diet (intake of vitamin
D3, 110 IU/day/100 g of body weight) was compared by X-ray and histological
examinations with that of rhesus monkeys (Old World monkey) fed a normal diet
(intake of vitamin D3, 5 IU/day/100 g of body weight). Three of 20 marmosets were
found by X-ray examination to have osteomalacic changes in their bones despite
the high daily intake of vitamin D3, whereas none of the 5 rhesus monkeys showed 
any signs of osteomalacia. Osteomalacic marmosets had distinct increases in
osteoid surface, relative osteoid volume, and active osteoclastic bone
resorption, whereas non-osteomalacic marmosets had no increase in osteoid tissues
in their bones. None of the marmosets, either osteomalacic or non-osteomalacic,
was hypercalcemic despite the extremely high circulating levels of 1
alpha,25(OH)2D3. However, the serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25OHD3) and
24R,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (24R,25(OH)2D3) levels were significantly lower in the
osteomalacic than in the non-osteomalacic marmosets. These results suggest that
the marmoset is likely to exhibit osteomalacic bone changes despite the high
daily intake of vitamin D3. These changes resemble those in vitamin D-dependent
rickets, type II.

Anteromedial hypothalamic lesions block proceptivity but not receptivity in the
female common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).

Kendrick KM, Dixson AF.

The sexual behavior of 8, estradiol-treated, ovariectomized common marmosets was 
recorded prior to and after bilateral radiofrequency lesions of the hypothalamus.
Lesions of the anterior hypothalamus, which extended to varying degrees into the 
medial hypothalamus, virtually abolished proceptive tongue-flicking and staring
displays. Tongue-flicking during copulation also decreased, but the females did
not show any significant increase in the number of mounts which they refused or
terminated with the exception of one animal which had received more extensive
damage to the medial hypothalamus. Significant increases in the frequencies of
allogrooming and grooming invitations also occurred after the females had been
lesioned. Sexual behavior was not significantly altered in 3 females which
received sham lesions. These results provide the first direct evidence for a
neuroanatomical distinction between hypothalamic mechanisms which regulate
proceptivity and receptivity in primates.

The dopamine neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)
produces histological lesions in the hypothalamus of the common marmoset.

Gibb WR, Lees AJ, Jenner P, Marsden CD.

The administration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) to
marmosets resulted in parkinsonism and degeneration of the substantia nigra pars 
compacta. Examination of the hypothalamus showed neuronophagic-like rosettes of
glial cells and diffuse increase in glial numbers in areas of the dopaminergic
A11-A14 groups. These findings suggest that MPTP may be toxic to dopamine neurons
of the hypothalamus as well as to the substantia nigra.

Nononcogenic deletion mutants of herpesvirus saimiri are defective for in vitro
immortalization.

Desrosiers RC, Silva DP, Waldron LM, Letvin NL.

Herpesvirus saimiri L-DNA sequences between 0.0 and 4.0 map units (4.5 kilobase
pairs) are required for oncogenicity; these sequences are not required for
replication of the virus. To investigate the basis for the lack of oncogenicity
of mutants with deletions in this region and to study the function of this
region, we developed a reliable system for in vitro immortalization by
herpesvirus saimiri. In contrast to peripheral blood lymphocytes from cotton-top 
tamarins (Saguinus oedipus) and owl monkeys (Aotus sp.), infection of peripheral 
blood lymphocytes from common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) in vitro with
herpesvirus saimiri consistently yielded continuously growing lymphoblastoid cell
lines. Such cell lines were established using strains of herpesvirus saimiri from
group A and group non-A, non-B; however, repeated attempts to immortalize common 
marmoset peripheral blood lymphocytes using strains from group B were not
successful. Common marmoset cell lines immortalized by herpesvirus saimiri were
T12+, T8+, T4-, and B1-, indicating that they were derived from
suppressor/cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Cell lines could not be established using the
nononcogenic mutants 11att and S4, both of which were derived from the group A
strain 11 virus. Strain 11att has a spontaneous deletion and S4 has a constructed
deletion in the 0.0 to 4.0 map unit region. Constructed strains which had these
deleted sequences restored did immortalize common marmoset peripheral blood
lymphocytes. Thus, the nononcogenic deletion mutants are defective for
immortalization. This system should facilitate attempts to define the sequences
responsible for immortalization and to determine their function.

The involvement of parents and siblings in infant care in similarly composed
groups of common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) and cotton-top tamarins (Saguinus
oedipus) was compared during the infants' first 8 weeks of life. The results
indicate an earlier infant independence in C. jacchus than in S. oedipus due
primarily to a more frequent rejection of carried infants in C. jacchus. There
was no species difference in extent of maternal involvment in carrying infants.
However, S. oedipus fathers carried infants significantly more often during weeks
5-8 than did C. jacchus fathers. Siblings were generally more involved in infant 
care at an earlier infant age in C. jacchus than in S. oedipus.

Proceptive displays of the female common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus): effects
of ovariectomy and oestradiol 17 beta.

Dixson AF.

Proceptivity in the common marmoset consisted of brief periods when females
remained with body and limbs immobile (IM) or crouched, and then stared,
lipsmacked and tongue-flicked at males. Treatment of ovariectomized females with 
oestradiol activated all these proceptive displays but did not influence the
combinations in which they occurred during IM periods.

Administration of MPTP to the common marmoset does not alter cortical cholinergic
function.

The administration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) to
common marmosets induced persistent motor deficits and decreased concentrations
of dopamine, homovanillic acid, and 3,4-dihydroxy-phenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and
[3H]dopamine uptake in the caudate-putamen. There was an 80% reduction in
tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactive cells in substantia nigra. At 10 days
following the start of MPTP administration, the activity of choline
acetyltransferase in the thalamus and frontal cortex was unchanged compared with 
control animals. Similarly, specific [3H]QNB binding was unaltered. At 4-6 weeks 
following the start of MPTP treatment, choline acetyltransferase activity and
[3H]QNB binding in the frontal cortex and thalamus remained unaffected. There was
no evidence for cell loss in the nucleus basalis of Meynert or alteration in the 
intensity of staining for acetylcholinesterase. MPTP treatment of the common
marmoset produces a nigrostriatal lesion. In contrast, MPTP did not alter
cortical cholinergic function and was not neurotoxic to the cholinergic cells in 
the nucleus basalis of Meynert.

Plasma testosterone concentrations during postnatal development in the male
common marmoset.

Dixson AF.

Repeated measurements of plasma testosterone (T) were made in 56 male marmosets
from the day of birth until 300 days of age and in 44 adults (greater than 3
years). The resulting profile of plasma T during postnatal development shows
higher levels during infancy (1-90 days) followed by a nadir between 100 and 170 
days and then a progressive rise in T during puberty. Although T levels of up to 
21 ng/ml were measured in infant males, mean levels (+/- SEM) were 5.4 +/- 0.6
ng/ml (days 1-10), declining gradually to 1.7 +/- 0.1 ng/ml (days 100-110). No
increase in mean T levels between 15 and 100 days was identified, and the onset
of puberty was earlier in some males than measured previously in this species.

Oral infection of a common marmoset with human T-cell leukemia virus type-I
(HTLV-I) by inoculating fresh human milk of HTLV-I carrier mothers.

Kinoshita K, Yamanouchi K, Ikeda S, Momita S, Amagasaki T, Soda H, Ichimaru M,
Moriuchi R, Katamine S, Miyamoto T, et al.

To obtain definitive evidence that milk-borne infection plays a critical role in 
the endemy or mother-to-child transmission of human T-cell leukemia virus type-I 
(HTLV-I), we inoculated concentrated fresh human milk cells obtained from HTLV-I 
carrier mothers into the oral cavity of a common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).
Twenty-eight milk samples were collected (5-10 ml each) from 17 carrier mothers
in the first week after delivery. Cells in the milk were centrifuged down and
resuspended in 1/10 vol of the milk fluid. The concentrated cell suspensions were
successively inoculated into the oral cavity of a common marmoset. The marmoset
was found to be seroconverted by indirect immunofluorescence assay at 2.5 months 
after the first inoculation of the milk (3.5 X 10(8) cells in total), and was
later confirmed to be infected with HTLV-I by the detection of viral antigen
expression in short-term cultures of its peripheral blood T-lymphocytes. The
results strongly support the working hypothesis that milk-borne infection plays a
significant role in the mother-to-child transmission of HTLV-I.

The dopamine D2 agonist LY 141865, but not the D1 agonist SKF 38393, reverses
parkinsonism induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) in
the common marmoset.

Nomoto M, Jenner P, Marsden CD.

Marmosets treated with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) (1-4
mg/kg i.p. daily for up to 8 days) develop profound parkinsonian akinesia.
Administration of the D1 agonist SKF 38393 (1-20 mg/kg i.p.) 4-6 weeks later had 
no effect on the motor activity of animals pretreated with MPTP. In contrast, the
administration of the D2 agonist LY 141865 (0.1 or 0.5 mg/kg i.p.) caused a
marked increase in motor activity lasting for up to 2 h. We conclude that
stimulation of D2 dopamine receptors is essential for motor activation of
parkinsonian marmosets and that D1 stimulation alone is not sufficient to
overcome the akinesia induced by MPTP treatment.

Plasmodium brasilianum in the common marmoset Callithrix jacchus.

Wedderburn N, Mitchell GH, Davies DR.

Chronic quartan malarial infection has been established in the common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus). Plasmodium brasilianum from a douroucouli monkey (Aotus
trivirgatus) was used to infect splenectomized twin animals, passed to an intact 
animal, and then to 4 other intact adults, 2 pairs of twins. In 2 of the 4 latter
animals there was continuing patency with parasitaemias of less than or equal to 
0.5% parasitized erythrocytes for 30 weeks. The other 2 had lower initial levels 
of parasitaemia; in 1 of these parasitaemias remained low or subpatent. All
marmosets developed lymphocytosis. One animal became ill 30 weeks after infection
with anaemia, weight loss and mild proteinurea, the other 3 remained well.
Histological examination showed minor changes in the kidneys; spleens of infected
animals showed marked follicular hyperplasia and phagocytosis of pigment. The
livers showed sinusoidal hypercellularity and pigment deposition and in
splenectomized animals, a marked lymphoid follicular hyperplasia in the portal
tracts.

Oral transmission of human T-cell leukemia virus type-I into a common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus) as an experimental model for milk-borne transmission.

Yamanouchi K, Kinoshita K, Moriuchi R, Katamine S, Amagasaki T, Ikeda S, Ichimaru
M, Miyamoto T, Hino S.

To obtain experimental support for possible milk-borne infection of human T-cell 
leukemia virus type-I (HTLV-I), short-term-cultured viral antigen-positive
lymphocytes obtained from peripheral blood of adult T-cell leukemia lymphoma
complex (ATLL) patients were inoculated into the oral cavity of two adult common 
marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) in amounts comparable to those of HTLV-I-carrying 
cells fed to a baby in the milk of seropositive mothers. One of the animals
seroconverted 2.5 months after the first inoculation. Cultures of peripheral
blood mononuclear leukocytes of the marmoset revealed HTLV-I antigen expression
in cells, indicating the establishment of oral infection of HTLV-I in an adult
marmoset. The cell number deduced to be responsible for the infection was 5.6 X
10(7) cells (used in the first 2 inoculations). The results suggest that the
concept of milk-borne infection of HTLV-I from a seropositive mother to her child
is plausible.

The mechanism of end-organ resistance to 1 alpha,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol in
the common marmoset.

Takahashi N, Suda S, Shinki T, Horiuchi N, Shiina Y, Tanioka Y, Koizumi H, Suda
T.

The common marmoset, a New World monkey, requires a large amount of
cholecalciferol (110 i.u./day per 100g body wt.) to maintain its normal growth.
In a previous report, we demonstrated that the circulating levels of 1 alpha,
25-dihydroxycholecalciferol [1 alpha,25(OH)2D3] in the marmosets are much higher 
than those in rhesus monkeys and humans, but the marmosets are not hypercalcaemic
[Shinki, Shiina, Takahashi, Tanioka, Koizumi & Suda (1983) Biochem. Biophys. Res.
Commun. 14, 452-457]. To compare the effect of the daily intake of
cholecalciferol, two rhesus monkeys were given a large amount of cholecalciferol 
(900 i.u./day per 100g body wt). Their serum levels of calcium,
25-hydroxycholecalciferol and 24R,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol were markedly
elevated, but the serum 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3 levels remained within a range similar 
to those in the rhesus monkeys fed the normal diet (intake of cholecalciferol 5
i.u./day per 100g body wt). Intestinal cytosols prepared from both monkeys
contained similar 3.5 S macromolecules to which 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3 was bound
specifically. However, the cytosols from the marmosets contained only one-sixth
as many 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3 receptors as those from the rhesus monkeys.
Furthermore, the activity of the 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3-receptor complex in binding to
DNA-cellulose was very low in the marmosets. These results suggest that the
marmoset possesses an end-organ resistance to 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3 and is a useful
animal model for studying the mechanism of vitamin D-dependent rickets, type II.

Observations on the interaction between adult group members, group members
without rearing experience and infants in the common marmoset, Callithrix
jacchus.

Engel C.

This study describes the reactions of adult, rearing-experienced members of three
Callithrix jacchus families to interactions between animals without rearing
experience and infants. The direct involvement of adult group members in
situations in which inexperienced animals interact with infants decreases as the 
infants become older. Inexperienced animals will approach infants more seldom, if
adult, rearing-experienced animals are nearby. Adult, rearing-experienced members
of the group display primarily noninteractive behavior. This is especially true
when no physical contact has taken place between an inexperienced animal and the 
infant, or if contact was initiated by the infant. Most of the dissociative
reactions were observed in the context of competition for objects and play
activity. However, there was a similarly high percentage of associative behavior 
towards inexperienced animals during play activity. In the episodes observed, the
adult, rearing-experienced animals displayed mainly taking care behavior towards 
the infant but never any dissociative behavior. The following points appear to be
of significance for the way adult, rearing-experienced members of the group
behave: spatial distance between inexperienced animal and infant; which party was
the initiator of the interaction; the level of experience already acquired by the
animals without previous rearing experience, and the level of maturation of the

Haematological characteristics of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus
jacchus).

McIntosh GH, Lawson CA, Rodgers SE, Lloyd JV.

Blood cell indices and parameters of haemostasis were studied in the common
marmoset. The majority of the results were similar to those found in man.
Differences from man were that the prothrombin time was shorter in the marmoset, 
higher concentrations of aggregating stimuli were required to cause platelet
aggregation, and marmoset platelets did not aggregate under the influence of
adrenalin. There was sexual dimorphism evident in the data for fibrinogen
concentration and for platelet count, both of which were higher in females than
in males. Marmoset platelets were very similar in ultrastructure to those of man.

Thermogenic capacity and brown adipose tissue activity in the common marmoset.

Rothwell NJ, Stock MJ.

Resting oxygen consumption was measured in anaesthetized male and female common
marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) at 29 degrees C. Injection of noradrenaline caused
a marked increase in oxygen consumption (63%), but this response was lower in
males. Large deposits (750 mg) of brown adipose tissue (BAT) were dissected from 
the cervical, subscapular, axillary and perirenal areas. High levels of guanosine
diphosphate binding to isolated brown fat mitochondria were observed, indicating 
that the thermogenic proton conductance pathway is very active in brown fat from 
the marmoset. High levels of brown adipose tissue thermogenesis in these animals 
may be related to a requirement for diet-induced thermogenesis.

1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-induced parkinsonism in the common
marmoset.

Jenner P, Rupniak NM, Rose S, Kelly E, Kilpatrick G, Lees A, Marsden CD.

The administration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) (1-4
mg/kg i.p.) for 4 days induced dose-dependent parkinsonism in the common marmoset
within 48 h. MPTP produced profound akinesia, rigidity of the trunk and limbs,
postural abnormalities, loss of vocalization and, in some cases, postural tremor.
In a single animal the administration of L-DOPA in conjunction with a peripheral 
decarboxylase inhibitor, reversed the parkinsonian symptoms. Subsequent
biochemical analysis showed a profound loss of dopamine and [3H]dopamine uptake
in the caudate-putamen, but no change in specific [3H]spiperone binding.

Undifferentiated carcinoma of the nasal tissues in the common marmoset.

Baskerville M, Baskerville A, Manktelow BW.

The occurrence of undifferentiated carcinoma of the nasal tissues in 3 adult
marmosets is described. The tumours appeared to arise from the respiratory
epithelium of the turbinate bones and nasal septum. They were poorly
differentiated, invaded the paranasal sinuses and hard palate and metastasized to
the lungs or liver.

Ovariectomy does not abolish proceptive behaviour cyclicity in the common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).

Kendrick KM, Dixson AF.

Unlike in other non-human primates, ovariectomy of the female marmoset did not
alter heterosexual interactions. Proceptive behaviour bouts retained the same
cyclicity, duration and frequency within tests as during the ovarian cycle.
Significant rises in plasma levels of cortisol, progesterone, oestrone and
testosterone were found during these proceptive behaviour bouts and in cortisol, 
progesterone and oestrone at their onset. Results suggest a role for
adrenocortical steroids in both maintaining female sexuality and regulating its
cyclicity during ovarian cycles in this primate.

The effect of haemolysis on some clinical chemistry parameters in the marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus).

Davy CW, Jackson MR, Walker JM.

The effect of haemolysis on the levels of commonly analysed plasma constituents
was investigated in the common marmoset. Results were divided into a) low levels 
of extra haemolysis (less than 2 g/l plasma haemoglobin) and b) high levels of
extra haemolysis (greater than 2 g/l plasma haemoglobin). Mean changes in plasma 
constituent levels were examined and the correlation with increased haemolysis
measured. Large changes in malate dehydrogenase and lactate dehydrogenase were
found at low levels of haemolysis. With higher levels of haemolysis there were
statistically significant changes in the levels of alanine aminotransferase,
isocitrate dehydrogenase, glutathione reductase, bilirubin, aspartate
aminotransferase and sorbitol dehydrogenase. The significance of these findings
is considered in relation to the interpretation of changes of plasma constituents
as indicators of tissue/organ damage.

Canine tooth root infection as a cause of facial abscess in the common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus).

Baskerville M.

Facial abscesses in a colony of common marmosets were found to be caused by
abscessation of an upper canine tooth root. Trauma to the upper canine, resulting
in exposure of the pulp cavity, was thought to be the mode of infection.
Radiography was the most useful diagnostic aid in establishing the nature and
extent of the lesion. Antibiotic therapy alone was inadequate, and provision of
drainage by extracting the tooth, in conjunction with antibiotics, proved the
most effective treatment.

Binding of human lymphocyte-specific monoclonal antibodies to common marmoset
lymphoid cells.

Barton RW, Thrall RS, Neubauer RH.

Commercially available monoclonal antibodies which bind to human lymphocyte
subsets were screened for their ability to bind to lymphoid cells from the common
marmoset Callithrix jacchus. Anti-Leu-5 and T11 were the only pan T-cell
antibodies which reacted strongly. None of the antibodies which bind human
lymphocytes of the helper/inducer subpopulation reacted with C. jacchus cells and
only one antibody, T8, specific for the cytotoxic/suppressor subset, bound to the
marmoset cells. The two antibodies tested which bind human B cells, B1 and
anti-HLA-DR, were also reactive with marmoset cells. The cellular specificity of 
the T11, T8, and B1 antibodies was determined by dual binding studies on the
fluorescence-activated cell sorter. The B1 antibody bound only Ig+ cells and all 
Ig+ cells were B1+. The T11 and T8 antibodies bound only to Ig- marmoset lymphoid
cells and, as in the human, all T8+ marmoset cells were also T11+. Thus, using
these monoclonal antibodies in the common marmoset one can identify three
populations of lymphoid cells: (1) T11+, T8+ cells; (2) T11+, T8- cells; (3) B1+ 
cells.

Spontaneous neoplasms of the marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). Oral and
nasopharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas.

Betton GR.

Eight spontaneous highly invasive oral and nasopharyngeal squamous cell
carcinomas were observed over an 18-month period in a breeding colony of the
common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). Affected marmosets were predominantly males
over four years of age. The incidence of this tumor in the four-year-plus age
group was 4.9%. The tumors were locally invasive through the palate to the nasal 
cavity, retrobulbar space and cranial cavity in some marmosets with lung
metastases present in three cases.

The structure and epididymal maturation of the spermatozoon of the common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).

Moore HD, Hartman TD, Holt WV.

Maturation of the spermatozoon of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) during
epididymal transit was investigated using light and electron microscopy. Except
for the caudal migration of the cytoplasmic droplet there were no apparent
ultrastructural modifications, although interesting morphological features of the
sperm head were observed such as the substructure of the acrosome and a waist at 
the equatorial region. Alteration to the plasmalemma during maturation was
reflected by an increasing capacity of the sperm surface to bind wheat germ
agglutinin (recognising n-acetyl-d-glucosamine) but not ricin communis or
concanavalin agglutinins. This change was concomitant with the development of
sperm fertilising capacity in this species.

Genetic polymorphism and linkage of the sixth and seventh complement components
(C6 and C7) in the common marmoset.

Whitehouse DB.

Using polyacrylamide gel isoelectric focusing and standard specific hemolytic
detection methods, genetic polymorphisms have been found in the sixth and seventh
complement components (C6 and C7) in two laboratory groups of Common marmosets.
The C6 locus is highly variable and the products of six alleles were observed;
three C7 alleles were found. Comprehensive breeding data indicated that both sets
of alleles are inherited in an autosomal codominant manner. Many of the C6
variants differed only by a minute charge interval. The C7 variant bands differed
by large charge intervals and could only be clearly seen in plasmas that had been
preincubated with neuraminidase. A linkage analysis of C6 and C7 phenotypes in
three, two-generation families gives reasonable evidence that the two loci are
linked in marmosets as they are in humans.

Callithrix aurita, an endangered marmoset endemic to eastern Brazil, was observed
from June to October 1982. Preliminary observations suggest that behavioral and
morphological differences exist which distinguish C. aurita from the common
marmoset, C. jacchus. New data are provided on the geographic distribution of C. 
aurita, extending it northward within the known ranges of C. penicillata in the
states of Sao Paulo and Minas Gerais and C. flaviceps in eastern Minas Gerais.

Monitoring ovarian function in marmosets and tamarins by the measurement of
urinary estrogen metabolites.

Hodges JK(1), Eastman SAK(1).

Author information: 
(1)The Institute of Zoology, The Zoological Society of London, Regent's Park,
London NW1 4RY, UK.

Practical aspects of urinary estrogen analysis were considered with regard to
establishing simple and reliable methods for monitoring ovarian function in
marmosets and tamarins. Changes in the hormone:creatinine ratio in small volumes 
of urine from the common marmoset were significantly correlated with changes in
24-h excretion. Comparison of the metabolism and excretion of estrogens during
the ovarian cycle in the common marmoset and cottontop tamarin revealed
interesting species differences. High concentrations of conjugated estrone were
measured in marmoset plasma, but estradiol 17β was the predominant estrogen in
urine. In contrast, estrone was the most abundant estrogen measured in tamarin
urine. Both species excreted very little estriol. Sulfates and glucuronides were 
present in urine in similar proportions before ovulation in the marmoset,
although after ovulation sulfates were the more abundant. Conversely, most of the
estrogens in tamarin urine appeared to be conjugated as glucuronides. Direct
assay for estrone sulfate was applied to the measurement of urinary estrogen
excretion during the ovarian cycle in a marmoset. The results compared well with 
those for total estradiol 17β after hydrolysis and ether extraction. The use of
direct assays for conjugated estrogens in small volumes of urine is suggested as 
a practical method for monitoring ovarian function in marmosets and tamarins.

Ultrastructural aspects of spermatogenesis in the common marmoset (Callithrix
jacchus).

Holt WV, Moore HD.

The pattern of normal spermatogenesis in the common marmoset, Callithrix jacchus,
is described and a system classifying the spermatogenic cycle into nine
successive stages is presented. In contrast to most previous studies of
spermatogenesis, the classification system developed in this study depends more
upon the recognition of characteristic cell associations rather than upon
identification of particular steps of spermatid development. The structurally
simple acrosome of the marmoset spermatozoon displays insufficiently clear
morphological changes during spermatid elongation to allow this to be used as a
key to spermatogenic classification. Ultrastructural aspects of spermatogenesis
in the marmoset are also described; in general, these correspond to similar
descriptions of this process in other primates.

Isolation, characterization and comparative aspects of the major serum
apolipoproteins, B-100 and AI, in the common marmoset, Callithrix jacchus.

Forgez P, Chapman MJ, Mills GL.

The two major apolipoproteins of marmoset serum have been isolated and
characterized, and on the basis of physicochemical and immunological criteria are
homologous with the human AI and B-100 proteins. Marmoset apolipoprotein AI was
the principal protein of high-density lipoproteins (HDL) and was purified by gel 
filtration chromatography and electrophoresis in alkaline-urea polyacrylamide gel
followed by electrophoretic elution. Purified marmoset apolipoprotein AI
displayed an Mr of approx. 27000, was polymorphic (five forms) on isoelectric
focussing, with pI values in the range 4.8-5.0, and migrated similarly to human
apolipoprotein AI in alkaline-urea gels. An overall resemblance was seen in the
amino acid composition of marmoset apolipoprotein AI and that of its human
counterpart with the notable exception that marmoset AI contained 1 isoleucine
residue/mole. An immunological reaction of partial identity between the human and
monkey proteins was seen upon immunodiffusion of their HDLs against antiserum to 
human apolipoprotein AI. Marmoset B-100 was the predominant apoprotein of VLDL
and LDL, resembling the human protein in its elution profile on gel filtration
chromatography in anionic detergent, and in its high apparent Mr (approx.
520000). The marmoset and human B-100 proteins were alike in amino acid
composition and carbohydrate content. Moreover, their immunological behaviour
with an antiserum to marmoset apolipoprotein B showed them to share certain
antigenic determinant(s). We conclude that the physicochemical properties of the 
principle apolipoproteins of Callithrix jacchus, a New World primate, markedly
resemble those of the human AI and B-100 proteins, suggesting therefore that they
may function similarly in lipid transport and metabolism. Counterparts to human
apolipoproteins AII, E, CII and CIII have also been tentatively identified.

Timing of ovulation and implantation in the common marmoset, Callithrix jacchus, 
by monitoring of estrogens and 6 beta-hydroxypregnanolone in urine.

Heger HW, Neubert D.

Urinary estrogen and 6 beta-hydroxypregnanolone excretions have been determined
in female marmosets by means of HPTLC. The levels observed in cycling females
during implantation and abortion are reported. Hormone analysis revealed a
characteristic pattern showing cyclic fluctuations of estrogens and progesterone.
Estrogen metabolites increase during the follicular phase up to 1 microgram/ml,
the progesterone metabolite level rises to 1.2 micrograms/ml urine during the
luteal phase. Maximum values of both are superimposed in many cases. Ovulatory
cycles can be monitored by following estrogen and progesterone metabolites in
urine samples. Thus ovulation and the onset of pregnancy can be estimated with a 
precision of +/- 24 h (or less).

The effect of the ovarian cycle on the sexual behaviour of the common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus).

Kendrick KM, Dixson AF.

The sexual behaviour of 7 pairs of marmosets was observed during 30 minute tests 
for 44-68 days and blood samples were collected from females for measurement of
plasma progesterone, testosterone and oestrone. Copulations occurred throughout
the ovarian cycle of 24-30 days. Females used a "tongue-flicking" display both as
an invitational behaviour (proceptive tongue-flicks) and during copulation
(receptive tongue-flicks) most frequently during the peri-ovulatory period.
Frequencies of proceptivity were correlated positively with high mean levels of
testosterone and oestrone during the cycle and with a short follicular phase.
Males showed significant increases in tongue-flicks, mounts and ejaculations
during the peri-ovulatory phase, together with a shortened post-ejaculatory
interval and increased duration of penile erection after ejaculation. A
retrospective analysis showed that these changes in the males' behaviour occurred
only during tests where females were proceptive and not during other tests in the
peri-ovulatory period. Females refused significantly more of the males' mounting 
attempts during the luteal phase and a corresponding reduction in mount frequency
occurred at this time. Grooming, scent-marking, olfactory inspections and some
other behaviours did not alter significantly in either sex during the ovarian
cycle.

Investigations into the induction of chronic experimental arthritis in the common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).

Hunneyball IM.

In an attempt to produce a superior model of rheumatoid arthritis, experiments
have been performed to investigate the ease of induction of experimental
arthritis in marmosets by immunological means. Marmosets were sensitised with the
following combinations of antigen and adjuvant: ovalbumin in Freund's complete
adjuvant (FCA), ovalbumin in FCA + Bordetella pertussis, methylated-BSA in FCA + 
B. pertussis or human fibrin in FCA + B. pertussis, and subsequently injected
with the corresponding antigen in saline into one knee joint. Animals receiving
ovalbumin, with or without B. pertussis, produced only a weak transient
monoarticular synovitis. Animals receiving Met-BSA + B. pertussis produced a
chronic synovitis but only mild erosive changes were apparent even 21 weeks after
intraarticular injection. Animals receiving human fibrin produced a transient
monoarticular synovitis of moderate intensity. These results indicate that the
marmoset offers no obvious advantages over the rabbit for the induction of
experimental rheumatoid arthritis.

Adult female common marmosets were weighed weekly for periods of 6-30 months. Of 
27 animals, 25 were pregnant at some stage of the investigation. Patterns of body
weight change throughout singleton, twin and triplet pregnancies were obtained
and compared. Maternal weight increase was dependent on the number of young in
utero; however, little or no change in weight was observed during the first 13
weeks of gestation, irrespective of the number of offspring delivered
subsequently. The overall maternal:fetal body weight ratio was 1.00:0.21, ranging
from 1.00:0.11 for singleton to 1.00:0.26 for triplet pregnancies. Lactation had 
little or no effect on maternal body weight during the first 4 weeks postpartum.

Fatal lymphoproliferative disease in a common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus)
following inoculation of Ag876 strain of Epstein-Barr virus and a tumor-promoting
agent: preliminary report.

Ablashi DV, Aulakh GS, Luetzeler J, Sundar KS, Armstrong GR, Faggioni A.

We report here the development of a fatal lymphoproliferative disease in a common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) following inoculation of the Ag876 strain of
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and of the tumor promoting agent
12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). The marmoset showed antibodies
against EBV capsid and early antigens (VCA, EA) but not against nuclear antigen
(EBNA). EBNA was detected in impression smears from lymph nodes and liver, and
the presence of the EBV genome was detected from the same organs by hydridization
techniques. To our knowledge this is the first report of the oncogenicity of this
strain of EBV. The need for further studies to assess the in vivo interaction
between EBV and tumor promoting agents in the development of malignancies is
stressed.

Inhibition of renin in the primate Callithrix jacchus (common marmoset).

Hofbauer KG, Ménard J, Michel JB, Wood JM.

The effects of an antiserum against human kidney renin and of H-142, a peptide
inhibitor of human renin, were studied in the primate Callithrix jacchus (common 
marmoset). In severely volume-depleted (low-salt diet and repetitive injections
of furosemide), conscious marmosets, the antiserum reduced blood pressure to the 
same extent as the converting enzyme inhibitor teprotide (-31 +/- 7 SEM mmHg and 
-30 +/- 5 mmHg). In mildly volume-depleted (normal salt diet and single injection
of furosemide), conscious marmosets, H-142 and teprotide induced a similar fall
in blood pressure (-14 +/- 4 mmHg and -15 +/- 2 mmHg). When H-142 was infused
after the injection of teprotide, it had no further effect on blood pressure.
Conversely, teprotide was ineffective when injected during the infusion of H-142.
These results show that in marmosets blood pressure can be lowered by specific
inhibitors of human renin. A converting-enzyme inhibitor has similar effects.
Hence the renin-angiotensin system appears to contribute significantly to the
maintenance of blood pressure in conscious, volume-depleted marmosets.

Analysis of DR-like molecules on a marmoset Epstein-Barr virus-induced cell line 
using a monomorphic anti-human HLA-DR monoclonal antibody.

Teillaud JL, Charron D, Goujet-Zalc C, Mahouy G.

Mouse anti-HLA D region-related (DR) monoclonal antibodies have been found to
cross-react with peripheral blood leukocytes from one primate species, the common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). Immunoprecipitates of radioactively labeled cells 
extracted from a marmoset Epstein-Barr virus-induced cell line were analyzed by
one- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and compared with the DR antigens of
a human lymphoblastoid B cell line. Two chains of estimated molecular weights of 
34 000 (alpha) and 28 000 (beta), similar to the human alpha and beta chains,
have been observed in marmoset immunoprecipitates. Additionally, a set of spots
located in the same area as the set of invariant spots found in human HLA-DR
antigens is shown by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Thus, cross-reacting
anti-human HLA-DR monoclonal antibodies could be used to analyze the expression
and the structure of marmoset DR-like antigens.

Distribution of catecholamine and indoleamine neurons in the brain of the common 
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).

Schofield SP, Dixson AF.

The distribution of monoamine neurons in the brains of ten common marmosets
(Callithrix jacchus) was examined by means of the Falck-Hillarp formaldehyde
histofluorescence technique. Large populations of catecholamine and indoleamine
neurons were found throughout the brain stem. Catecholamine cell bodies
corresponded essentially to th noradrenaline and dopamine groups defined as A1-A7
and A8-A14, respectively. In contrast to Old World primate species, however, the 
noradrenaline cell populations (particularly the pontine coeruleal A6 group) were
less numerous. Ascending catecholamine fibre pathways were not observed within
the medulla or pons, although numerous axons were found near the mesodiencephalic
border. These were fine and smooth in appearance in contrast to those of other
species and this finding may represent a significant morphological difference.
The catecholamine terminal innervation of the diencephalon was modest in the
marmoset and was less dense than in other primates. In contrast, limbic areas and
the striatum contained very large numbers of terminals. Indoleamine cell bodies, 
equivalent to the serotonin groups defined as B1-B9, were also observed. The most
rostral cell populations (B7-9) were large. In addition, pontine and medullary
indoleamine neurons extended laterally through the tegmentum as noted in other
primates, such that they often adjacent to catecholamine neurons. A prominent
bundle of indoleamine axons was observed in the mesencephalon and corresponded to
a fibre pathway seen in rodents and other primates. No terminal varicosities were
noted.

was very similar in all species, although subtle variations were found.
Catecholamine (noradrenaline and dopamine) and indoleamine (serotonin) cell
bodies corresponding to groups A1-A7, A8-A10, and B1-B9, respectively were found 
throughout the brainstem. A few catecholamine (dopamine) cells equivalent to
groups All and A12 in the diencephalon were also observed. Noradrenaline neurons,
rather than those of the dopamine and serotonin systems, tended to be less
numerous in the New World monkeys. Ascending catecholamine and indoleamine fiber 
bundles were observed in most monkeys. It is interesting that fibers
corresponding to the "ventral noradrenaline bundle" appeared to be much finer in 
the common marmoset and tamarin than in other species. In addition, a substantial
catecholamine (noradrenaline) innervation of the diencephalon was noted in all
the Old World monkeys, while a much lower overall terminal density was apparent
in the New World forms.

(1)Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London, London, England.

Hematological studies have been carried out on a group of 96 common marmosets
(Callithrix jacchus) on which full clinical histories were available. The group
included both healthy and sick animals. Reference values for red-cell,
white-cell, and platelet counts; hemoglobin levels; packed cell volumes; red- and
white-cell absolute values; reticulocyte counts; and fibrinogen levels were
calculated from results obtained in 43 clinically normal individuals. These
reference values have been used to identify hematological abnormalities in sick
animals so that relationships between the blood picture and the clinical findings
could be defined. Leucopenia, raised platelet counts, and high fibrinogen levels 
were found in animals with bacterial infections and carried poor prognosis. Heinz
bodies occurred in a significant number of the group as a whole, and were
associated with a variety of hematological and clinical abnormalities. These
findings illustrate the diagnostic and prognostic value of clinical hematology in
C. jacchus.

Plasma progesterone levels throughout the ovarian cycle of the common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus).

Harding RD, Hulme MJ, Lunn SF, Henderson C, Aitken RJ.

Radioimmunoassay of progesterone in marmoset plasma has been used to determine
ovarian cycle length. Total cycle length was 30.1 +/- 3.8 days (mean +/- SD, n = 
30, range 24-41 days, median 29.5 days). The pre-ovulatory (follicular) phase,
during which progesterone levels were below 10 ng/ml, lasted for 8.8 +/- 3.7 days
(mean +/- SD, n = 30, range 3-20 days, median 8.5 days). The post-ovulatory
(luteal) phase, during which progesterone levels were greater than 10 ng/ml,
lasted for 21.5 +/- 2.2 days (mean +/- SD, n = 30, range 14-29 days, median 21.5 
days). Total cycle length was almost twice that recorded in an earlier study. The
reasons for this difference are discussed.

The postnatal development of the temporomandibular joint of the common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus).

Wilson NH(1), Gardner DL.

Author information: 
(1)University of Manchester, England.

The temporomandibular joints (TMJ) of 55 male and 50 female common marmosets
(Callithrix jacchus) with an age range of 1 day- to < 12-yr-old have been studied
to extend the knowledge on the craniomandibular articulation of this primate.
Details of changes in the bone structure, gross and functional anatomy, and
histologic appearance of the marmoset TMJ during the neonatal period, infancy,
childhood, adolescence, and adulthood are compared with those which occur in the 
TMJ of man. It is concluded that further investigations on the structure and
function of the marmoset TMJ and jaws may establish this nonhuman primate as a
valuable analog for TMJ research in man.

Plasma prolactin concentrations during the ovarian cycle and lactation and their 
relationship to return of fertility post partum in the common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus).

McNeilly AS, Abbott DH, Lunn SF, Chambers PC, Hearn JP.

A heterologous double-antibody radioimmunoassay was used to measure plasma
prolactin concentrations in 27 marmosets. The assay was valid for the marmoset
because plasma levels of prolactin were increased in response to TRH and
metoclopramide and suppressed in response to bromocriptine treatment. During the 
cycle there were no consistent changes in plasma prolactin concentrations. During
lactation mothers suckling single or twin infants had higher prolactin levels
than did non-suckling females and levels were highest with twins. No
statistically significant delay in the resumption of ovulation post partum was
observed for the suckling and non-suckling females; conception occurred in all
but one marmoset by 70 days post partum. These results show that neither the
suckling stimulus nor high levels of prolactin post partum delay the return of
ovulation and fertility in the common marmoset, a result in contrast to that for 
all other primate species so far investigated.

Immunological characterization of hemopoietic cells in the common marmoset,

Crawford DH, Janossy G, Hetherington CM, Francis GE, Edwards AJ, Hoffbrand AV,
Prentice HG.

Bone marrow, lymphoid, and peripheral blood cells from the common marmoset and
rhesus monkey have been tested with a panel of heterologous and monoclonal
antibodies, and their reactivity pattern has been compared with that of blood and
bone marrow cells from human donors. Conventional antibodies reveal extensive
cross-reactivity within the B cell, T cell, and granulocytic systems in all three
species, however, some important differences have been exposed. Only the
monoclonal antibodies to HLA-A,B,C and Ia-like antigens react with marmoset
cells, and we have exploited this finding to show that the vast majority of
colony-forming units (CFU-c) in the marmoset bone marrow (as in man) are Ia
positive. The use of the common marmoset as a suitable model for human bone
marrow transplantation is discussed in the light of these findings.

Competition for a desired food in family groups of the common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus) and the cotton-top tamarin (Saguinus oedipus).

Tardif SD, Richter CB.

Four captive groups of common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) and three groups of 
cotton-top tamarins (Saguinus oedipus) were each presented with a desired food
and their consumption was monitored. Inequalities in consumption between
individuals were found for each group of each species. Generally, adult females
consumed most of the desired food, followed by juveniles, and finally adult
males. High consumption levels by all individuals during isolated feedings
indicated that consumption inequalities within groups were most likely due to
competition rather than inter-individual preference differences. Aggressive
defense of the food cup was performed most frequently by adult females in both
species. In Callithrix jacchus groups, this aggression was most often directed
against adult males, but in Saguinus oedipus groups, it was most often directed
against juveniles. Modification of the method of food presentation, such that
food was more dispersed, lessened, but did not eliminate, inequalities in
consumption.

Husbandry and breeding of a newly-established colony of cotton-topped tamarins
(Saguinus oedipus oedipus).

Brand HM.

From November 1976 to February 1979 a total of 8 litters were born to 6 females. 
Of the 14 infants, 10 were successfully reared by their parents. Housing,
nutrition, a balance between environmental stability and stimulation, and female 
multiparity are seen as factors contributing to the breeding success of this
colony. A controlled male and female pairing programme provided information on
mating behavior and gestation length. One gestation of at least 166 days was
observed, longer than that of the common marmoset.

Cemented annulation as an age criterion in the common marmoset (Callithrix
jacchus).

Stott GG, Sis RF, Levy BM.

Teeth from 18 marmosets, seven months to 5.8 years of age, were studied
histologically. A minimum of one dark and one light band comprised one cemental
annulation. Age was estimated by counting the number of annulations and adding
four months to premolar and eight months to canine teeth for tooth development.
Cemental annulations were most consistent near the gingival border on the labial 
aspect of the tooth. The method will be valuable in estimating the ages of
marmosets and other nonhuman primates.

Density distribution, characterization, and comparative aspects of the major
serum lipoproteins in the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a New World
primate with potential use in lipoprotein research.

Chapman MJ, Mc Taggart F, Goldstein S.

Qualitative, quantitative, and comparative aspects of the serum lipoprotein
profile in the Common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a New World primate, are
described. Density gradient ultracentrifugation was used to evaluate lipoprotein 
distribution and to establish criteria for isolation of discrete molecular
fractions. The major lipoprotein classes banded isopycnically on the gradient
with the following hydrated densities: VLDL, d less than 1.017 g/mL; LDL, d =
1.027--1.055 g/mL; HDL fraction I, d = 1.070--1.127 g/mL; and HDL fraction II, d 
= 1.127--1.156 g/mL. Electrophoretic, immunological, and electron microscopic
analyses attested to the purity of these fractions: the characteristics of each
were assessed by chemical analysis, electron microscopy, immunological
techniques, and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of their protein moieties.
Marmoset VLDL and LDL were closely akin to those of man in size and chemical
composition, although the former were richer in triglyceride; electrophoretic and
immunological data showed the major protein component of VLDL and LDL to be a
counterpart to human apo-B. The two HDL subfractions, i.e., HDL-I and HDL-II,
corresponded in size and chemical composition to human HDL2 and HDL3,
respectively, although slight differences in neutral lipid content were detected.
By immunological and electrophoretic criteria, the major apolipoprotein of
marmoset HDL was analogous to human apo-AI. In contrast, marked dissimilarities
were evident in the complements of low molecular weight, tetramethylurea-soluble 
polypeptides of marmoset and human lipoproteins. Quantitatively, the human and
marmoset lipoprotein profiles were not dissimilar, although HDL was the major
class (approximately 50%); in fasting animals, serum concentrations of VLDL, LDL,
and HDL were 50--90, 170--280, and 338--408 mg/dL, respectively. C. jacchus was
distinct from man in displaying a greater proportion of its total HDL in the less
dense (HDL-II) subfraction (marmoset HDL-I/HDL-II = approximately 4:1; human
HDL2/HDL3 = approximately 1:3). These data indicate that, as an experimental
animal for lipoprotein research, the Common marmoset combines the advantages of
ready availability and maintenance with a serum lipoprotein profile which
resembles, in many qualitative and quantitative aspects, that found in man.

Pregnancy diagnosis in the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus jacchus).

Lunn SF, Hobson BM, Hearn JP.

Abdominal palpation of the uterus was carried out on 25 pregnant and 29
non-pregnant marmosets (Callithrix jacchus jacchus). 195 complete 24-hour urine
specimens, collected between the first week of gestation and term (21 weeks),
were tested with the Sub-Human Primate Tube (SHPT) test. No significant
differences between the two methods in their ability to diagnose pregnancy were
obtained between the first and 13th week of gestation. The SHPT test was seldom
positive after the 13th week of pregnancy, whereas, with one exception, palpation
always indicated pregnancy.

Bacterial and mycoplasma flora of a laboratory colony of the common marmoset

Hill AC, Turton JA, Bleby J.

A survey was carried out to characterise the bacterial and mycoplasma flora of a 
closed colony of marmosets, Callithrix jacchus. Bordetella bronchiseptica and
Staphylococcus aureus were the only potential bacterial pathogens isolated from
the colony; Candida albicans was also identified. S aureus and C albicans were
the only organisms which were associated with macroscopic lesions or overt
disease. Post mortem examination of the animals proved only reliable method of
establishing the presence of some bacterial species in the colony, eg, B
bronchiseptica and of obtaining a reliable estimate of the incidence of the
various organisms within the colony. The marmosets were all infected with
ureaplasmas in the upper respiratory tract. Mycoplasma salivarium was isolated
from this site in several animals. There was no evidence to indicate that
cross-infection had occurred between the animal technicians and the marmosets,
except in one possible case of candidiasis.

Sex determination in the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).

Stein FJ.

The general morphology of the external genitalia was examined in 43 common
marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) ranging in age from newborn to adult. At birth,
the scrotum was a small irregular fold of skin on either side of the caudal
aspect of the penis. The testes were not present in the scrotum until 8--11
months of age. The scrotum covered the penis in the adult male, was devoid of
fur, was covered by pearly while nodules, and presented a median raphe. In the
young female, the pudendal pad closely resembled the scrotum of the male. The
vulva was pendulous, and the small vestibular opening was located near its most
ventral aspect and closely resembled the preputial opening of the male. In the
adult female, the pudendal pad was pendulous, was studded with white nodules, and
closely resembled the scrotum of the male. Sex determination by casual
observation resulted in numerous errors. Accurate sex determination was based on 
differences in the preputial and vestibular openings, demonstration of the glans 
penis in the prepuce, and palpation of the testes in the scrotum or inguinal
region.

Use of the common marmoset, Callithrix jacchus, in reproductive research.

Hearn JP, Abbott DH, Chambers PC, Hodges JK, Lunn SF.

A self-sustaining colony of common marmosets, Callithrix jacchus, was established
for reproductive research. Methods of management were developed to ensure optimal
breeding conditions for marmosets in captivity. Studies of the reproductive
biology and endocrinology of this species suggest that the common marmoset may be
a suitable model for the human in certain aspects of the ovarian cycle,
pregnancy, puberty and the hypothalamic and pituitary control of luteinizing
hormone secretion. The rapid rate of reproduction of C. jacchus in captivity
allows a relatively large colony to be maintained at moderate cost and also makes
this species a most suitable laboratory primate for longer term studies of the
safety and efficacy of new contraceptive methods.

Composition of the milk of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) and milk
substitutes used in hand-rearing programmes, with special reference to fatty
acids.

Turton JA, Ford DJ, Bleby J, Hall BM, Whiting R.

Analyses of marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) milk were carried out to determine
values for crude protein, lactose, total lipids, major minerals, and osmotic
pressure. Mean values were (g/100 ml): protein, 3.6; lactose, 7.5; total lipids, 
7.7; minerals (mg/100 ml): sodium, 21.4; potassium, 54.3; calcium, 92.2;
phosphorus, 22.8; magnesium, 5.0; chloride, 52.2; osmotic pressure, 354 mosm/kg
water. Similar analyses were conducted on 2 milk substitutes used in hand-rearing
programmes. Fatty acid analyses were carried out on natural milk, the milk
substitutes, and the marmoset diet. For hand-rearing C. jacchus it is recommended
that a human milk substitute is modified by increasing the levels of protein,
carbohydrate, and total lipids, and that a small amount of fish oil is added.

Aggression and flight behaviour of the marmoset monkey Callithrix jacchus: an
ethogram for brain stimulation studies.

Lipp HP.

The aggressive and flight behaviour of the common marmoset monkey (Callithrix
jacchus) is described and split into behavioural units, allowing analysis of
agonistic behaviour evoked by electrical stimulation of the hypothalamus. The
social context of the described units is also considered. C. jacchus shows
clearly recognizable behavioural patterns. Free-born animals are very timid and
show typical flight reactions. Within aggressive behaviour, two types of
aggression can be distinguished: very violent attacks causing severe injuries,
often accompanied by particular threat displays and observed during dominance and
territorial encounters, and, on the other hand, relatively harmless short
attacks, together with a noisy vocalization, for defensive purposes or keeping
group members at a distance.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus jacchus) as a model for ethological
research.

Stevenson MF.

The uses and advantages of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus jacchus) as an
animal model for ethological research were examined. It was found that this
species had advantages over Old World primates for work on social behavior as a
nearer approximation to the group structure occurring in natural conditions could
be obtained in the laboratory. The small size of the common marmoset also made it
easier to handle and cheaper to maintain. The adult female gave birth at
five-month intervals and usually reared twin offspring. This, and the short
generation time, made it an ideal model for mother-infant behavioral studies. The
common marmoset was also shown to be a useful model for studies of social play,
especially for categorizing the changes in playful behavior with age, and the
relationship of the patterns seen in play to other behaviors. It was also
suggested that it may be an ideal model for experimental studies of play. Other
suggested uses included studies of the relationship of food supply and feeding
habits to territory size and group structure, and of the advantages to elder
offspring of helping to rear younger siblings. As a result of these observations 
the common marmoset was considered to have great potential as a model for
ethological research, both in its natural habitat and in the laboratory.

An ethogram of the common marmoset (Calithrix jacchus jacchus): general
behavioural repertoire.

Stevenson MF, Poole TB.

The behavioural repertoire of four captive breeding pairs of Callithrix jacchus
jacchus is described. Social communication took the form of postures, facial
expressions, vocalizations and piloerection displays. Detailed analyses were made
of piloerection displays, adult play, copulatory, aggressive, and prey-catching
behaviour. Aggressive behaviour was uncommon in adult mated pairs. Play between
adults showed a degree of temporal of temporal organization. Vocalizations were
the main methods of intragroup communication whilst piloerection displays were
directed towards members of other groups and also to unfamiliar objects. The
behavioural repertoire of C. jacchus jacchus is compared with that of other
Primates.

The embryology of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).

Phillips IR.

Earlier studies have noted the unusual placental anatomy of marmosets and the
high frequency of biovular, synchorial twinning. The maintenance of a captive
colony of Callithrix jacchus has enabled further studies to be made of embryonic 
development in this species. Thirty-six embryos from seventeen pregnancies were
examined in detail and assigned to horizons on the basis of Streeter's
classification of external form and internal structure. The specimens represented
tha major part of the embryonic period and, with few exceptions, the structural
development of the marmoset closely resembled that of the other primates that
have been described. Marmoset embryos of a given horizon were consistently
shorter than those of man. The timing of morphogenesis in C. jacchus was
different from that observed in man and other primates. There was a considerable 
delay in early embryogenesis in the marmoset, although subsequent to stage XI,
development proceeded at approximately the same rate as other primates. The
available evidence suggested that this anomaly was not due to delayed
implantation or embryonic diapause but to a generally slower rate of early
development. The evolution of synchorial twinning is considered as a possible
reason for this mode of development.

[Article in German]

Rothe H.

The use of the hand of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus Erxleben, 1777)
was analysed on the basis of observations and experiments conducted on 56 animals
of all age. During arboreal locomotion Callithrix jacchus makes use of the hands 
for support and for grasping to maintain its balance, The palmar region serves as
the main means of support, while the findgers in the locomotor grip also
contribute to maintaining balance and support. The greater the need for
maintaining balance, for example, during vertikal climbing or in movement along
the narow branches, the mre complete the djustment of the hand form on the
surface and the more complete the alignment of the hand on the branch will be.
Additional support is supplied by the longitudinal palm furrow, caused by the
radio-ulnar adduction of the hand edges and by the clinging properties of the
volar pads...

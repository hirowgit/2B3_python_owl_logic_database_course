The neuropeptide melanocyte-inhibiting factor (MIF) or
L-propyl-L-leucyl-glycinamide (PLG) has been reported in some studies to improve 
the motor signs of Parkinson's disease (PD) and in rodent models of PD. In this
study of oral and intravenous MIF in N-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine
(MPTP)-lesioned marmosets, a wide range of doses of MIF administered alone (0.25,
1, 2, 5, 10, 20 mg/kg orally) did not increase locomotor activity, relieve motor 
disability, or induce dyskinesias. When MIF (1.0 and 5.0 mg/kg orally or 10 and
20 mg/kg intravenously) was administered concomitantly with levodopa/benserazide,
no significant differences in motor function or dyskinesias were observed
compared with levodopa/benserazide alone. The results of this first study of MIF 
in the marmoset MPTP model provide no encouragement for the reinvestigation of
MIF in the clinical management of the motor signs of PD.

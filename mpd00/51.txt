BDNF or vehicle were administered by unilateral supranigral infusion in normal
and chronically lesioned MPTP-treated common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) for
four weeks and locomotor activity, disability and response to apomorphine were
assessed with nigral TH, GFAP and GAD immunoreactivity and striatal [3H]mazindol 
autoradiography. Selective contraversive orientation and ipsilateral neglect
evolved in MPTP-treated marmosets receiving BDNF with no significant difference
in disability or locomotor activity when compared to the vehicle-infused group.
Apomorphine produced an ipsiversive rotational bias in BDNF-treated animals. In
normal animals infused with BDNF contralateral neglect, ipsiversive turning,
postural instability and ataxia rapidly evolved. In MPTP-treated marmosets BDNF
caused increased ipsilateral striatal [3H]mazindol binding with increased somatic
size and staining intensity in GAD-immunoreactive cells and a 10-20% loss of
nigral TH-immunoreactive cells with increased GFAP staining. In normal common
marmosets, both vehicle and BDNF infusion decreased nigral TH-immunoreactivity.
Chronic supranigral infusion of BDNF alters motor behaviour and spatial attention
in MPTP-treated marmosets which may reflect altered function in residual nigral
dopaminergic neurons and brainstem GABAergic neurons and in normal animals
produces behavioural and histological signs of nigrostriatal hypofunction.

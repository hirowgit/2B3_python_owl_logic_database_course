The treatment of dyskinesia in Parkinson׳s disease remains poor but H3 receptor
agonists have been suggested as a novel pharmacological approach. We examined the
effects of the H3 agonist, immepip, in 6-OHDA-lesioned rats exhibiting AIMs
(abnormal involuntary movements), a rat analogue of dyskinesia, in response to
l-dopa compared to the known anti-dyskinetic agents amantadine, MK-801 and
8-OHDPAT. We then attempted to extend these studies in to dyskinetic
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) treated common marmosets.
Amantadine, MK-801 and 8-OHDPAT all dose-dependently reduced l-dopa-induced
axial, lingual and oral (ALO) AIMs in 6-OHDA-lesioned animals accompanied by a
reduction in contralateral rotation with higher doses of amantadine and MK-801.
By contrast, immepip had no effect on AIMs expression or contralateral rotation. 
In the MPTP-treated common marmoset exhibiting dyskinesia to l-dopa, immepip
alone induced retching and in combination with l-dopa administered subcutaneously
or orally induced the rapid onset of retching and vomiting which was not
controlled by pretreatment with domperidone. Administration of the unrelated H3
agonist, imetit had the same effect. Despite causing negative side-effects, it
appears that both agonists reduced the antiparkinsonian response to l-dopa
resulting in reduced dyskinesia. H3 agonists appear unlikely candidates for the
treatment of dyskinesia in PD based on lack of evidence of efficacy and potential
adverse effects.

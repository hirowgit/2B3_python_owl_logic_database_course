Blockade of serotonin 2A (5-HT2A) receptors is regarded as an anti-dyskinetic and
anti-psychotic strategy in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the 5-HT2A
antagonists tested so far exhibited affinity for other receptors, which might
have played a role in their action. EMD-281,014 is the most selective 5-HT2A
antagonist available, with approximately 2,000-fold selectivity over serotonin 2C
(5-HT2C) receptors. EMD-281,014 was previously tested in the clinic and has high 
translational potential. In the present study, we assessed the effect of
EMD-281,014 on dyskinesia and psychosis in the
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-lesioned common marmoset. We 
first determined the pharmacokinetic profile of EMD-281,014 in the marmoset,
after which doses leading to clinically-relevant plasma levels (0.01, 0.03 and
0.1 mg/kg) or vehicle were administered to MPTP-lesioned marmosets, in
combination with L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA). The effects of
EMD-281,014 on dyskinesia, psychosis-like behaviours (PLBs) and parkinsonism were
then evaluated. When added to l-DOPA, EMD-281,014 (0.03 and 0.1 mg/kg) reduced
peak dose dyskinesia, by 41.8% and 54.5% (P < 0.05 and P < 0.001), when compared 
to l-DOPA/vehicle. EMD-281,014 (0.03 and 0.1 mg/kg) also significantly reduced
the severity of peak dose PLBs, by 42.5% and 45.9% (P < 0.05 and P < 0.001), when
compared to vehicle. The anti-dyskinetic and anti-psychotic effects of
EMD-281,014 were achieved without interfering with l-DOPA anti-parkinsonian
action. Our results suggest that highly-selective 5-HT2A receptor blockade with
EMD-281,014 is an effective way to alleviate both dyskinesia and psychosis in PD,
without adversely affecting parkinsonian disability.

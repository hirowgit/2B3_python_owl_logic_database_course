Monoamine oxidase (MAO) type B (MAO-B) inhibition was shown to confer
anti-parkinsonian benefit as monotherapy and adjunct to
L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) in clinical trials. Here, we explore the
anti-parkinsonian effect of MAO type A (MAO-A) inhibition as monotherapy, as the 
enzyme MAO-A is also encountered within the primate and human basal ganglia,
where it metabolises dopamine, albeit to a lesser extent than MAO-B. In six
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-lesioned marmosets, we
assessed the anti-parkinsonian effect of the reversible MAO-A inhibitor
moclobemide (0.1 and 1 mg/kg) as monotherapy and compared it to that of L-DOPA
and vehicle treatments. Moclobemide significantly reversed parkinsonism (by 39%, 
P < 0.01), while eliciting only mild dyskinesia and psychosis-like behaviours
(PLBs). In contrast, L-DOPA anti-parkinsonian effect was accompanied by marked
dyskinesia and PLBs. MAO-A inhibition with moclobemide may provide
anti-parkinsonian benefit when administered without L-DOPA and might perhaps be
considered as monotherapy for the treatment of Parkinson's disease in the early
stages of the condition.

The differences in dopamine turnover rate between the putamen and the caudate
nucleus in the striatum lesioned by a neurotoxin
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) were studied in the common
marmoset, a small New World monkey. Systemic administration of MPTP damaged
equally and dose-dependently nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons projecting both
to the caudate nucleus and the putamen. The compensatory increase of dopamine
turnover, however, occurred more prominently in the putamen than in the caudate. 
The neural connection and function of the caudate nucleus and the putamen have
been differentiated anatomically or physiologically. The compensatory increase of
dopamine turnover rate is another different aspect of functions between the
caudate nucleus and the putamen. Dopaminergic neurons projecting to the putamen
showed more prominent cell loss than those projecting to the caudate in
Parkinson's disease or related disorders. The selective augmented turnover rate
of lesioned dopaminergic neurons might be, at least partly, involved with
selective degeneration of nigrostriatal neurons projecting to the putamen.

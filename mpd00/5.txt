Advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) is often complicated by the occurrence of
dyskinesia, motor fluctuations and psychosis. To this day, few treatment options 
are available for each of these phenomena, and they are at times not effective or
elicit adverse events, leaving some patients short of therapeutic options. We
have recently shown that positive allosteric modulation of metabotropic 2 (mGlu2)
receptors with the prototypical positive allosteric modulator (PAM) LY-487,379 is
efficacious at alleviating both dyskinesia and psychosis-like behaviours (PLBs), 
while simultaneously enhancing the anti-parkinsonian action of
L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA), in the
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-lesioned marmoset. Here, we
assessed the effects of CBiPES, a mGlu2 PAM derived from LY-487,379, but with
improved pharmacokinetic properties. Six MPTP-lesioned marmosets with
reproducible dyskinesia and PLBs were administered L-DOPA in combination with
vehicle or CBiPES (0.1, 1 and 10 mg/kg), after which their behaviour was rated.
CBiPES 10 mg/kg reduced global dyskinesia by 60% (P < 0.0001), while peak dose
dyskinesia was reduced by 66% (P < 0.001), compared to L-DOPA/vehicle. CBiPES
10 mg/kg also diminished global PLBs by 56% (P < 0.0001), while peak dose PLBs
were reduced by 64% (P < 0.001), compared to L-DOPA/vehicle. Lastly, CBiPES
enhanced the anti-parkinsonian action of L-DOPA, by reducing global parkinsonian 
disability by 43% (P < 0.01), compared to L-DOPA/vehicle. Our results provide
further evidence that mGlu2 positive allosteric modulation may be an approach
that could be efficacious for the treatment of dyskinesia, psychosis and motor
fluctuations in PD.

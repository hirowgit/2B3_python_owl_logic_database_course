Virtually every patient affected by Parkinson's disease (PD) eventually requires 
treatment with L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA), which leads to
complications such as dyskinesia and psychosis. Whereas blockade of serotonin 2A 
(5-HT2A) receptors appears to be an effective way to reduce both dyskinesia and
psychosis, whether it has the potential to eliminate the two phenomena remains to
be determined. In a previous study, we showed that highly selective 5-HT2A
receptor blockade with EMD-281,014, at plasma levels comparable to those achieved
in the clinic, reduced dyskinesia and psychosis-like behaviours (PLBs), in the
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-lesioned marmoset. Here, we
sought to determine whether further increasing the dose would result in greater
therapeutic benefit or if maximal effectiveness was achieved at lower doses. Six 
MPTP-lesioned marmosets with stable dyskinesia and PLBs were administered
EMD-281,014 (0.1, 1 and 10 mg/kg) or vehicle in combination with L-DOPA and the
effect on dyskinesia, PLBs and parkinsonism was assessed. Administration of
EMD-281,014 (0.1, 1 and 10 mg/kg) in combination with L-DOPA resulted in a
significant reduction in the severity of dyskinesia, by up to 63%, 64% and 61%
(each P < 0.001), when compared to L-DOPA/vehicle. Similarly, the addition of
EMD-281,014 (0.1, 1 and 10 mg/kg) to L-DOPA also significantly decreased the
severity of PLBs, by up to 54%, 55% and 53% (each P < 0.001), when compared to
L-DOPA/vehicle. Our results suggest that there might be a ceiling to the
reduction of dyskinesia and psychosis that can be achieved through antagonism of 
5-HT2A receptors.

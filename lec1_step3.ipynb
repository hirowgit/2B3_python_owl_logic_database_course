We have recently shown that activation of metabotropic glutamate 2 \\nreceptors (mGluR2), via either orthosteric stimulation or positive allosteric\\nmodulation, enhances the anti-dyskinetic and anti-psychotic effects of 5-HT2AR\\nantagonism. Here, we investigated if greater therapeutic efficacy would be\\nachieved by combining 5-HT2AR antagonism with concurrent mGluR2 orthosteric\\nstimulation and mGluR2 positive allosteric modulation.\\nMETHODS: Five 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-lesioned\\nmarmosets exhibiting dyskinesia and psychosis-like behaviours (PLBs) were\\nadministered L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) in combination with vehicle or\\nthe 5-HT2AR antagonist EMD-281,014. EMD-281,014 was itself administered alone or \\nwith the mGluR2 orthosteric agonist (OA) LY-354,740, the mGluR2 positive\\nallosteric modulator (PAM) LY-487,379 and combination thereof, after which the\\nseverity of dyskinesia, PLBs and parkinsonism was rated.\\nRESULTS: EMD-281,014 reduced dyskinesia and PLBs by up to 47% and 40%,\\nrespectively (both P < 0.001). The addition of LY-354,740, LY-487,379 and\\nLY-354,740/LY-487,379 decreased dyskinesia by 56%, 65% and 77%, while PLBs were\\ndiminished by 55%, 63% and 71% (all P < 0.001). All treatment combinations\\nprovided anti-dyskinetic and anti-psychotic benefits significantly greater than\\nthose conferred by EMD-281,014 alone (all P < 0.05). The combination of\\nEMD-281,014/LY-354,740/LY-487,379 resulted in anti-dyskinetic and anti-psychotic \\neffects significantly greater than those conferred by EMD-281,014 with either\\nLY-354,740 or LY-487,379 (both P < 0.05). No deleterious effects on L-DOPA\\nanti-parkinsonian action were observed.\\nCONCLUSION: Our results suggest that combining 5-HT2AR antagonism with mGluR2\\nactivation results in greater reduction of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia and PD\\npsychosis. They also indicate that further additive effect can be achieved when a\\nmGluR2 OA and a mGluR2 PAM are combined with a 5-HT2AR antagonist than when a\\nmGluR2 OA or a mGluR2 PAM are added to a 5-HT2AR antagonist.\\n\\n© 2021.

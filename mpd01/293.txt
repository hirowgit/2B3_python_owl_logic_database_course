Whereas monoamine oxidase (MAO) type B inhibitors are used as adjunct to
L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) in the treatment of Parkinson's disease
(PD), the enzyme MAO type A (MAO-A) also participates in the metabolism of
dopamine in the human and primate striatum. Here, we sought to assess the effect 
of the selective reversible MAO-A inhibitor moclobemide on L-DOPA
anti-parkinsonian in the gold standard animal model of PD, the
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-lesioned primate. We also
assessed the effect of moclobemide on L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia and
psychosis-like behaviours (PLBs). Experiments were performed in six MPTP-lesioned
marmosets chronically treated with L-DOPA and exhibiting stable dyskinesia and
PLBs upon each administration. In a randomised within-subject design, animals
were administered a therapeutic dose of L-DOPA in combination with moclobemide
(0.1, 1 and 10 mg/kg) or its vehicle, after which the severity of parkinsonism,
dyskinesia, and PLBs was rated by an experienced blinded rater. Moclobemide
significantly reduced the global parkinsonian disability (- 36% with 0.1 mg/kg,
P < 0.05; - 38% with 1 mg/kg, P < 0.01; - 47% with 10 mg/kg, P < 0.01), when
compared with its vehicle. This reduction of parkinsonism was not accompanied by 
an exacerbation of dyskinesia or PLBs. Reversible MAO-A inhibition with
moclobemide appears as an effective way to increase the anti-parkinsonian action 
of L-DOPA, without negatively affecting dyskinesia or dopaminergic psychosis.

Hair cortisol concentration (HCC) provides a long-term retrospective measure of
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity, and is increasingly used to assess 
the life history, health and ecology of wild mammals. Given that sex, age, season
and pregnancy influence HCC, and that it may indicate ongoing stress, we examined
HCC in common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) naturally inhabiting a hot and dry
semi-desert like habitat, Caatinga, in northeastern Brazil. We trapped, measured,
weighed, marked and collected shaved hair from the back of the neck of 61 wild
marmosets during the wet and dry seasons. Using enzyme immunoassay, we found that
HCC was higher in the dry season compared with the wet season among all age/sex
classes. Females had significantly higher HCC than males, juveniles had higher
HCC than adults, and reproductively active adult females and non-pregnant/non
lactating adult females did not differ in HCC. There were no interaction effects 
of sex, age, group, or season on HCC. The magnitude of the effect of this
extremely hot and dry environment (average yearly rainfall was only 271 mm) on
HCC in common marmosets is difficult to ascertain as these animals are also
experiencing a variety of other stressors. However, the elevated HCC seen in
common marmosets during the 5-8 month dry season, suggests these primates face an
extended period of heat, water and possibly nutritional stress, which appears to 
result in a high rate of juvenile mortality.

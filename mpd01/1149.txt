Common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) monkeys are a resource for biomedical
research and their use is predicted to increase due to the suitability of this
species for transgenic approaches. Identification of abnormal neurodevelopment
due to genetic modification relies upon the comparison with validated patterns of
normal behavior defined by unbiased methods. As scientists unfamiliar with
nonhuman primate development are interested to apply genomic editing techniques
in marmosets, it would be beneficial to the field that the investigators use
validated methods of postnatal evaluation that are age and species appropriate.
This review aims to analyze current available data on marmoset physical and
behavioral postnatal development, describe the methods used and discuss next
steps to better understand and evaluate marmoset normal and abnormal postnatal
neurodevelopment.

Oxidative stress is implicated in various pathological conditions of the retina
and optic nerve. Peroxiredoxins (Prdxs) comprise a recently characterized family 
of antioxidant enzymes. To date, little information exists regarding the
distribution of Prdxs in the eye. Herein, we employed a combination of qRT-PCR,
immunohistochemistry and Western blotting to determine the level of expression
and distribution of the six Prdx isoforms in the retina and optic nerve of the
rat. In addition, we performed some parallel analyses on the common marmoset
(Callithrix Jacchus). In the rat, all of the Prdx transcripts were expressed in
relatively high amounts in both retina and optic nerve, with abundances ranging
from approximately 3-50 % of the level of the housekeeping gene cyclophilin. With
regard to protein expression, each isoform was detected in the retina and optic
nerve by either Western blotting and/or immunohistochemistry. Excepting Prdx4,
there was a good correspondence between the rodent and primate results. In the
retina, Prdx1 and Prdx2 were principally localized to neurons in the inner
nuclear layer and cone photoreceptors, Prdx3 and Prdx5 displayed characteristic
mitochondrial immunolabeling, while Prdx6 was associated with astrocytes and
Müller cells. In the optic nerve, Prdx1 was robustly expressed by
oligodendrocytes, Prdx3 and Prdx5 were observed in axons, and Prdx6 was
restricted to astrocytes. The present findings augment our understanding of the
distribution and expression of the Prdxs in the retina and optic nerve of rodents
and primates and lay the foundation for subsequent analysis of their involvement 
in relevant blinding diseases.

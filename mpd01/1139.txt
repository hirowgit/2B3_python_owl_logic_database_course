Spermatogonia are specialized cells responsible for continuous spermatogenesis
and the production of offspring. Because of this biological property, in vitro
culture of spermatogonia provides a powerful methodology to advance reproductive 
biology and engineering. However, methods for culturing primate spermatogonia are
poorly established. We have designed a novel method for culturing spermatogonia
in the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a small primate. By using our method
with a suite of growth factors, adult marmoset testis-derived germ cells could be
cultured in the form of a floating sphere for several weeks. Notably, this method
could be applied not only to freshly isolated cells but also to cryopreserved
cell stocks. The spheres enriched spermatogonia and early spermatocytes, and
could be assembled from a C-KIT(+) spermatogonial population. Techniques for
culturing spermatogonia could facilitate increased understanding of primate
reproduction as well as the preservation of valuable biomaterials from nonhuman
primates.

Adult male-female bonds are partly characterized by initiating and maintaining
close proximity with a social partner, as well as engaging in high levels of
affiliative and sociosexual behavior. Oxytocin (OXT), a neuromodulatory
nonapeptide, plays a critical role in the facilitation of social bonding and
prosocial behavior toward a social partner (Feldman, 2012). However, less
attention has been given to whether augmentation of OXT levels in an individual
alters others' perceptions and behavior toward an OXT-treated social partner. We 
examined social dynamics in well-established male-female pairs of marmoset
monkeys (Callithrix jacchus) in which one member of the pair was administered an 
intranasal OXT agonist, an OXT antagonist (OXTA), or saline. OXT treatment did
not alter the expression of affiliative toward an untreated partner. However, OXT
did significantly influence the expression of proximity and grooming behavior
with a treated partner, as a function of OXT treatment and sex. Female interest
in initiating and maintaining proximity with a pair-mate was altered by OXT
treatment. Untreated female marmosets departed from their saline-treated partner 
more frequently than they approached them, as indicated by a low proximity index 
score. However, when males received an intranasal OXT agonist they had a
significantly increased proximity index score relative to saline, indicating that
their untreated partner approached them more often than they departed from them).
Saline-treated females initiated and received equivalent levels of grooming
behavior. However, when female marmosets were treated with an OXT agonist their
untreated partner groomed them proportionately more often, for a greater total
duration, and for more time per bout, than they initiated grooming behavior.
These results suggest that intranasal OXT altered male and female marmosets'
stimulus properties in such a way as to increase the amount of grooming behavior 
that females received from their long-term mate, as well as increase female
interest in initiating and maintaining proximity with their long-term mate.
Furthermore, these results support the notion that central OXT activity plays an 
important neuromodulatory role in the maintenance of long-lasting male-female
relationships.

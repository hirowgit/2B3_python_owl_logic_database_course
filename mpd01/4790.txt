Supplemental feeding of marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) triplets.

Ziegler TE, Stein FJ, Sis RF, Coleman MS, Green JH.

In a colony of marmosets (Callithrix jacchus), all fifteen infants from five sets
of triplet births were successfully reared with their parents. Two supplemental
feedings were given each infant daily. As an alternative to hand-rearing or
foster rearing, the supplemental feeding method eliminated the time-consuming
process of hand caring for an infant on a 24-hour per day basis.

Immunological characterization of hemopoietic cells in the common marmoset,
rhesus monkey, and man. In search of a model for human marrow transplantation.

Bone marrow, lymphoid, and peripheral blood cells from the common marmoset and
rhesus monkey have been tested with a panel of heterologous and monoclonal
antibodies, and their reactivity pattern has been compared with that of blood and
bone marrow cells from human donors. Conventional antibodies reveal extensive
cross-reactivity within the B cell, T cell, and granulocytic systems in all three
species, however, some important differences have been exposed. Only the
monoclonal antibodies to HLA-A,B,C and Ia-like antigens react with marmoset
cells, and we have exploited this finding to show that the vast majority of
colony-forming units (CFU-c) in the marmoset bone marrow (as in man) are Ia
positive. The use of the common marmoset as a suitable model for human bone
marrow transplantation is discussed in the light of these findings.

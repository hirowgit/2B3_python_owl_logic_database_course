Understanding the connectivity architecture of entire vertebrate brains is a
fundamental but difficult task. Here we present an integrated neuro-histological 
pipeline as well as a grid-based tracer injection strategy for systematic
mesoscale connectivity mapping in the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).
Individual brains are sectioned into ~1700 20 µm sections using the tape transfer
technique, permitting high quality 3D reconstruction of a series of histochemical
stains (Nissl, myelin) interleaved with tracer labeled sections. Systematic
in-vivo MRI of the individual animals facilitates injection placement into
reference-atlas defined anatomical compartments. Further, by combining the
resulting 3D volumes, containing informative cytoarchitectonic markers, with
in-vivo and ex-vivo MRI, and using an integrated computational pipeline, we are
able to accurately map individual brains into a common reference atlas despite
the significant individual variation. This approach will facilitate the
systematic assembly of a mesoscale connectivity matrix together with
unprecedented 3D reconstructions of brain-wide projection patterns in a primate
brain.

Marmoset has emerged as a useful nonhuman primate species for studying brain
structure and function. Previous studies on the mouse primary auditory cortex
(A1) showed that neurons with preferential frequency-tuning responses are mixed
within local cortical regions, despite a large-scale tonotopic organization. Here
we found that frequency-tuning properties of marmoset A1 neurons are highly
uniform within local cortical regions. We first defined the tonotopic map of A1
using intrinsic optical imaging and then used in vivo two-photon calcium imaging 
of large neuronal populations to examine the tonotopic preference at the
single-cell level. We found that tuning preferences of layer 2/3 neurons were
highly homogeneous over hundreds of micrometers in both horizontal and vertical
directions. Thus, marmoset A1 neurons are distributed in a tonotopic manner at
both macro- and microscopic levels. Such organization is likely to be important
for the organization of auditory circuits in the primate brain.

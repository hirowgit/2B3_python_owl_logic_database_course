Animal hybridization is well documented, but evolutionary outcomes and
conservation priorities often differ for natural and anthropogenic hybrids. Among
primates, an order with many endangered species, the two contexts can be hard to 
disentangle from one another, which carries important conservation implications. 
Callithrix marmosets give us a unique glimpse of genetic hybridization effects
under distinct natural and human-induced contexts. Here, we use a 44 autosomal
microsatellite marker panel to examine genome-wide admixture levels and
introgression at a natural C. jacchus and C. penicillata species border along the
São Francisco River in NE Brazil and in an area of Rio de Janeiro state where
humans introduced these species exotically. Additionally, we describe for the
first time autosomal genetic diversity in wild C. penicillata and expand previous
C. jacchus genetic data. We characterize admixture within the natural zone as
bimodal where hybrid ancestry is biased toward one parental species or the other.
We also show evidence that São Francisco River islands are gateways for
bidirectional gene flow across the species border. In the anthropogenic zone,
marmosets essentially form a hybrid swarm with intermediate levels of admixture, 
likely from the absence of strong physical barriers to interspecific breeding.
Our data show that while hybridization can occur naturally, the presence of
physical, even if leaky, barriers to hybridization is important for maintaining
species genetic integrity. Thus, we suggest further study of hybridization under 
different contexts to set well informed conservation guidelines for hybrid
populations that often fit somewhere between "natural" and "man-made."

FILAMENTOUS FUNGI ISOLATED FROM THE FUR MICROBIOTA OF CALLITRICHIDS KEPT IN
CAPTIVITY IN BRAZIL.

de Freitas RA, Milanelo L, Bondan EF, Bentubo HD.

This study aimed to isolate filamentous fungi from the fur of primates of the
genus Callithrix kept in the Centre for Rehabilitation of Wild Animals (CRWA) at 
the Tietê Ecological Park, São Paulo, SP, Brazil. Samples of the fur of 19
specimens of black-tufted marmosets (Callithrix penicillata) and 6 specimens of
white-tufted-ear marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) were obtained by the square
carpet technique. The samples were plated on Mycosel™ agar medium (Difco™) and
incubated at 25°C for 21 days. The identification of each isolated mold was based
on its macroscopic and microscopic features and followed classical
recommendations. The following filamentous fungi were isolated: Penicillium spp. 
(76%), Cladosporium spp. (60%), Acremonium spp. (44%), Scopulariopsis spp. (24%),
Aspergillus spp. (16%), Chrysosporium spp. (16%), and Fusarium spp. (8%).
Dermatophyte fungi were not detected. We conclude that C. penicillata and C.
jacchus kept in captivity are sources of potentially pathogenic filamentous fungi
that may represent a risk factor for immunocompromised individuals who may
eventually establish contact with them.

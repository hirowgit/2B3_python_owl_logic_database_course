Buprenorphine is an essential component of analgesic protocols in common
marmosets (Callithrix jacchus). The use of buprenorphine HCl (BUP) and
sustained-release buprenorphine (BSR) formulations has become commonplace in this
species, but the pharmacokinetics have not been evaluated. Healthy adult (age,
2.4 to 6.8 y; 6 female and 6 male) common marmosets were enrolled in this study
to determine the pharmacokinetic parameters, plasma concentration-time curves,
and any apparent adverse effects of these compounds. Equal numbers of each sex
were randomly assigned to receive BUP (0.02 mg/kg IM) or BSR (0.2 mg/kg SC),
resulting in peak plasma concentrations (mean ± 1 SD) of 15.2 ± 8.1 and 2.8 ± 1.2
ng/mL, terminal phase t1/2 of 2.2 ± 1.0 and 32.6 ± 9.6 h, and AUC0-last of 16.1 ±
3.7 and 98.6 ± 42.7 ng × h/mL. The plasma concentrations of buprenorphine
exceeded the proposed minimal therapeutic threshold (0.1 ng/mL) at 5 and 15 min
after BUP and BSR administration, showing that both compounds are rapid-acting,
and remained above that threshold through the final time points of 8 and 72 h.
Extrapolation of the terminal elimination phase of the mean concentration-time
curves was used to develop the clinical dosing frequencies of 6 to 8 h for BUP
and 3.0 to 3.5 d for BSR. Some adverse effects were observed after the
administration of BUP to common marmosets in this study, thus mandating judicious
use in clinical practice. BSR provided a safe, long-acting option for analgesia
and therefore can be used to refine analgesic protocols in this species.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) has attracted considerable attention,
especially in the biomedical science and neuroscience research fields, because of
its potential to recapitulate the complex and multidimensional phenotypes of
human diseases, and several neurodegenerative transgenic models have been
reported. However, there remain several issues as (i) it takes years to generate 
late-onset disease models, and (ii) the onset age and severity of phenotypes can 
vary among individuals due to differences in genetic background. In the present
study, we established an efficient and rapid direct neuronal induction method
(induced neurons; iNs) from embryonic and adult marmoset fibroblasts to
investigate cellular-level phenotypes in the marmoset brain in vitro. We
overexpressed reprogramming effectors, i.e., microRNA-9/9*, microRNA-124, and
Achaete-Scute family bHLH transcription factor 1, in fibroblasts with a small
molecule cocktail that facilitates neuronal induction. The resultant iNs from
embryonic and adult marmoset fibroblasts showed neuronal characteristics within
two weeks, including neuron-specific gene expression and spontaneous neuronal
activity. As directly reprogrammed neurons have been shown to model
neurodegenerative disorders, the neuronal reprogramming of marmoset fibroblasts
may offer new tools for investigating neurological phenotypes associated with
disease progression in non-human primate neurological disease models.

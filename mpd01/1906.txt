As the information bottleneck of nearly all auditory input that reaches the
cortex, the auditory thalamus serves as the basis for establishing auditory
cortical processing streams. The functional organization of the primary and
nonprimary subdivisions of the auditory thalamus is not well characterized,
particularly in awake primates. We have recorded from neurons in the auditory
thalamus of awake marmoset monkeys and tested their responses to tones, band-pass
noise, and temporally modulated stimuli. We analyzed the spectral and temporal
response properties of recorded neurons and correlated those properties with
their locations in the auditory thalamus, thereby forming the basis for parallel 
output channels. Three medial geniculate body (MGB) subdivisions were identified 
and studied physiologically and anatomically, although other medial subdivisions 
were also identified anatomically. Neurons in the ventral subdivision (MGV) were 
sharply tuned for frequency, preferred narrowband stimuli, and were able to
synchronize to rapid temporal modulations. Anterodorsal subdivision (MGAD)
neurons appeared well suited for temporal processing, responding similarly to
tone or noise stimuli but able to synchronize to the highest modulation
frequencies and with the highest temporal precision among MGB subdivisions.
Posterodorsal subdivision (MGPD) neurons differed substantially from the other
two subdivisions, with many neurons preferring broadband stimuli and signaling
changes in modulation frequency with nonsynchronized changes in firing rate. Most
neurons in all subdivisions responded to increases in tone sound level with
nonmonotonic changes in firing rate. MGV and MGAD neurons exhibited responses
consistent with provision of thalamocortical input to core regions, whereas MGPD 
neurons were consistent with provision of input to belt regions.

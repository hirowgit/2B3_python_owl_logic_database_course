The optical performance of the eyes of nine vertebrate species was evaluated
using optical system design techniques and schematic eye models. Essential
features of eyes, including the modulation transfer function (MTF) and the MTF
cutoff frequency are related to the numerical aperture of the eyes. Superior
resolution for in vivo imaging of photoreceptors may be achieved by dilating the 
iris pupil of an eye, minimizing coherence, and using short wavelength
illumination. The difference of lateral and axial resolution between a small and 
a large eye for imaging photoreceptors in vivo.

RATIONALE: Some features of Parkinson's disease are exacerbated by stress and
anxiety and it is important to understand the effects of dopamine receptor
agonists on measures of anxiety. The aim of this study was to assess the effects 
of the dopamine D2/D3 receptor agonist ropinirole in models of anxiety and
depression in the rat, mouse and marmoset.
RESULTS: In the rat elevated plus-maze test, ropinirole (0.01-1 mg/kg, i.p.)
produced an inverted-U dose-response curve in the percentage time spent in the
open arms. Compared with vehicle, ropinirole (0.1 mg/kg) had a significant
anxiolytic-like effect, which was similar to that observed with 1.5 mg/kg
diazepam. This effect was found at doses that did not affect motor behaviour or
induce stereotypy. In the mouse black and white box test of anxiety, ropinirole
(0.1-10 mg/kg, i.p.) increased both the rearing time and number of line crosses
in the white section. This effect reached statistical significance for both
measures at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg and suggests an anxiolytic-like action of the
compound. By contrast, the dopamine agonist bromocriptine (0.1-10 mg/kg, i.p.)
did not produce significant changes in these behaviours. In the marmoset human
threat test, ropinirole (0.01-10 microg/kg, s.c.) reduced the number of postures 
at all doses tested and this reached statistical significance at 10 microg/kg.
Ropinirole did not compromise the effect of amitriptyline in the Porsolt test of 
depression and in itself produced antidepressant-like effects.
CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that systemic administration of ropinirole
produces anxiolytic-like effects in three separate models in the mouse, rat and
marmoset. This may predict an action of ropinirole in man that would provide a
superior profile of action over other presently available anti-parkinsonian
agents.

Ninety-two bifidobacterial strains were obtained from the faeces of 5 baby common
marmosets, three known species Bifidobacterium aesculapii, Bifidobacterium
callithricos and Bifidobacterium reuteri and 4 novel putative bifidobacterial
species were retrieved. The occurrence of bifidobacteria in non-human primate
babies is described for the first time.

Fecal alpha1-proteinase inhibitor (α1-PI) concentration has been to diagnose
enteric protein loss in dogs and cats. Chronic lymphocytic enteritis is commonly 
seen in the marmoset (Callithrix jaccus) and is characterized by hypoalbuminemia.
As a prelude to immunoassay development for detecting enteric protein loss,
marmoset serum α1-PI was purified using immunoaffinity chromatography and ceramic
hydroxyapatite chromatography. Partial characterization was performed by reducing
gel electrophoresis and enzyme inhibitory assays. Protein identity was confirmed 
with peptide mass fingerprinting and N-terminal amino acid sequencing. Molecular 
mass, relative molecular mass, and isoelectric point for marmoset α1-PI were
54 kDa, 51,677, and 4.8-5.4, respectively. Trypsin, chymotrypsin, and elastase
inhibitory activity were observed. N-terminal amino acid sequence for marmoset
α1-PI was EDPQGDAAQKMDTSHH. In conclusion, marmoset α1-PI was successfully
purified from serum with an overall yield of 12% using a rapid and efficient
method. Purified marmoset α1-PI has characteristics similar to those of α1-PI
reported for other species.

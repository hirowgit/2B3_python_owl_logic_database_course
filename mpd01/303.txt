The term chimera has been borrowed from Greek mythology and has a long history of
use in biology and genetics. A chimera is an organism whose cells are derived
from two or more zygotes. Recipients of tissue and organ transplants are
artificial chimeras. This review concerns natural human chimeras. The first human
chimera was reported in 1953. Natural chimeras can arise in various ways. Fetal
and maternal cells can cross the placental barrier so that both mother and child 
may become microchimeras. Two zygotes can fuse together during an early embryonic
stage to form a fusion chimera. Most chimeras remain undetected, especially if
both zygotes are of the same genetic sex. Many are discovered accidently, for
example, during a routine blood group test. Even sex-discordant chimeras can have
a normal male or female phenotype. Only 28 of the 50 individuals with a
46,XX/46,XY karyotype were either true hermaphrodites or had ambiguous genitalia.
Blood chimeras are formed by blood transfusion between dizygotic twins via the
shared placenta and are more common than was once assumed. In marmoset monkey
twins the exchange via the placenta is not limited to blood but can involve other
tissues, including germ cells. To date there are no examples in humans of twin
chimeras involving germ cells. If human chimeras are more common than hitherto
thought there could be many medical, social, forensic, and legal implications.
More multidisciplinary research is required for a better understanding of this
fascinating subject.

Associations between altered DNA methylation of the serotonin transporter
(5-HTT)-encoding gene SLC6A4 and early life adversity, mood and anxiety
disorders, and amygdala reactivity have been reported. However, few studies have 
examined epigenetic alterations of SLC6A4 in schizophrenia (SZ). We examined CpG 
sites of SLC6A4, whose DNA methylation levels have been reported to be altered in
bipolar disorder, using 3 independent cohorts of patients with SZ and age-matched
controls. We found significant hypermethylation of a CpG site in SLC6A4 in male
patients with SZ in all 3 cohorts. We showed that chronic administration of
risperidone did not affect the DNA methylation status at this CpG site using
common marmosets, and that in vitro DNA methylation at this CpG site diminished
the promoter activity of SLC6A4. We then genotyped the 5-HTT-linked polymorphic
region (5-HTTLPR) and investigated the relationship among 5-HTTLPR, DNA
methylation, and amygdala volume using brain imaging data. We found that patients
harboring low-activity 5-HTTLPR alleles showed hypermethylation and they showed a
negative correlation between DNA methylation levels and left amygdala volumes.
These results suggest that hypermethylation of the CpG site in SLC6A4 is involved
in the pathophysiology of SZ, especially in male patients harboring low-activity 
5-HTTLPR alleles.

The γδ T cell lineage in humans remains much of an enigma due to the low number
of defined antigens, the non-canonical ways in which these cells respond to their
environment and difficulty in tracking this population in vivo. In this review,
we survey a comparative evolutionary analysis of the primate V, D and J gene
segments and contrast these findings with recent progress in defining antigen
recognition by different populations of γδ T cells in humans. Signatures of both 
purifying and diversifying selection at the Vδ and Vγ gene loci are placed into
context of Vδ1+ γδ T cell recognition of CD1d presenting different lipids, and Vγ
9Vδ2 T cell modulation by pyrophosphate-based phosphoantigens through the
butyrophilins BTN3A. From this comparison, it is clear that co-evolution between 
γδ TCRs and these ligands is likely occurring, but the diversity inherent in
these recombined receptors is an important feature in ligand surveillance.

The muscle mass-specific mean power output (PMMS,mean) during push-off in jumping
in marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) is more than twice that in humans. In the
present study it was tested whether this is attributable to differences in muscle
contractile properties. In biopsies of marmoset m. vastus lateralis (VL) and m.
gastrocnemius medialis (GM) (N=4), fibre-type distribution was assessed using
fluorescent immunohistochemistry. In single fibres from four marmoset and nine
human VL biopsies, the force-velocity characteristics were determined. Marmoset
VL contained almost exclusively fast muscle fibres (>99.0%), of which 63% were
type IIB and 37% were hybrid fibres, fibres containing multiple myosin heavy
chains. GM contained 9% type I fibres, 44% type IIB and 47% hybrid muscle fibres.
The proportions of fast muscle fibres in marmoset VL and GM were substantially
larger than those reported in the corresponding human muscles. The curvature of
the force-velocity relationships of marmoset type IIB and hybrid fibres was
substantially flatter than that of human type I, IIA, IIX and hybrid fibres,
resulting in substantially higher muscle fibre mass-specific peak power
(PFMS,peak). Muscle mass-specific peak power output (PMMS,peak) values of
marmoset whole VL and GM, estimated from their fibre-type distributions and
force-velocity characteristics, were more than twice the estimates for the
corresponding human muscles. As the relative difference in estimated PMMS,peak
between marmosets and humans is similar to that of PMMS,mean during push-off in
jumping, it is likely that the difference in in vivo mechanical output between
humans and marmosets is attributable to differences in muscle contractile
properties.

The extent to which vocal learning can be found in nonhuman primates is key to
reconstructing the evolution of speech. Regarding the adjustment of vocal output 
in relation to auditory experience (vocal production learning in the narrow
sense), effects on the ontogenetic trajectory of vocal development as well as
adjustment to group-specific call features have been found. Yet, a comparison of 
the vocalizations of different primate genera revealed striking similarities in
the structure of calls and repertoires in different species of the same genus,
indicating that the structure of nonhuman primate vocalizations is highly
conserved. Thus, modifications in relation to experience only appear to be
possible within relatively tight species-specific constraints. By contrast,
comprehension learning may be extremely rapid and open-ended. In conjunction,
these findings corroborate the idea of an ancestral independence of vocal
production and auditory comprehension learning. To overcome the futile debate
about whether or not vocal production learning can be found in nonhuman primates,
we suggest putting the focus on the different mechanisms that may mediate the
adjustment of vocal output in response to experience; these mechanisms may
include auditory facilitation and learning from success. This article is part of 
the theme issue 'What can animal communication teach us about human language?'

We are currently living the advent of a new age for medicine in which basic
research is being quickly translated into marketable drugs, and the widespread
access to genomics data is allowing the design and implementation of personalized
solutions to medical conditions. Non-human primates (NHP) have gained an
essential role in drug discovery and safety testing due to their close
phylogenetic relationship to humans. In this study, a collection of well
characterized genes of the human immune system was used to define the
orthology-based immunome in four NHP species, with carefully curated annotations 
available based on multi-tissue RNA-seq datasets. A broad variation in the
frequency of expressed protein isoforms was observed between species. Finally,
this analysis also revealed the lack of expression of at least four different
chemokines in new-world primates. In addition, transcripts corresponding to four 
genes including interleukin 12 subunit alpha were expressed in humans but no
other primate species analyzed. Access to the non-human primate immunome is
available in http://www.fidic.org.co:90/proyecto/.

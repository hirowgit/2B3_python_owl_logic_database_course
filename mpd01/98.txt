Amazonia has the richest primate fauna in the world. Nonetheless, the diversity
and distribution of Amazonian primates remain little known and the scarcity of
baseline data challenges their conservation. These challenges are especially
acute in the Amazonian arc of deforestation, the 2500 km long southern edge of
the Amazonian biome that is rapidly being deforested and converted to
agricultural and pastoral landscapes. Amazonian marmosets of the genus Mico are
little known endemics of this region and therefore a priority for research and
conservation efforts. However, even nascent conservation efforts are hampered by 
taxonomic uncertainties in this group, such as the existence of a potentially new
species from the Juruena-Teles Pires interfluve hidden within the M. emiliae
epithet. Here we test if these marmosets belong to a distinct species using new
morphological, phylogenomic, and geographic distribution data analysed within an 
integrative taxonomic framework. We discovered a new, pseudo-cryptic Mico species
hidden within the epithet M. emiliae, here described and named after Horacio
Schneider, the pioneer of molecular phylogenetics of Neotropical primates. We
also clarify the distribution, evolutionary and morphological relationships of
four other Mico species, bridging Linnean, Wallacean, and Darwinian shortfalls in
the conservation of primates in the Amazonian arc of deforestation.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is an omnivorous New World primate whose
diet in the wild includes large amounts of fruit, seeds, flowers, and a variety
of lizards and invertebrates. Marmosets also feed heavily on tree gums and
exudates, and they have evolved unique morphological and anatomical
characteristics to facilitate gum feeding (gummivory). In this study, we
characterized the fecal microbiomes of adult and infant animals from a captive
population of common marmosets at the Callitrichid Research Center at the
University of Nebraska at Omaha under their normal dietary and environmental
conditions. The microbiomes of adult animals were dominated by species of
Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides, Prevotella, Phascolarctobacterium, Megamonas, and
Megasphaera. Culturing and genomic analysis of the Bifidobacterium populations
from adult animals identified four known marmoset-associated species (B. reuteri,
B. aesculapii, B. myosotis, and B. hapali) and three unclassified taxa of
Bifidobacterium that are phylogenetically distinct. Species-specific quantitative
PCR (qPCR) confirmed that these same species of Bifidobacterium are abundant
members of the microbiome throughout the lives of the animals. Genomic loci in
each Bifidobacterium species encode enzymes to support growth and major marmoset 
milk oligosaccharides during breastfeeding; however, metabolic islands that can
support growth on complex polysaccharide substrates in the diets of captive
adults (pectin, xyloglucan, and xylan), including loci in B. aesculapii that can 
support its unique ability to grow on arabinogalactan-rich tree gums, were
species-specific. IMPORTANCE Bifidobacterium species are recognized as important,
beneficial microbes in the human gut microbiome, and their ability colonize
individuals at different stages of life is influenced by host, dietary,
environmental, and ecological factors, which is poorly understood. The common
marmoset is an emerging nonhuman primate model with a short maturation period,
making this model amenable to study the microbiome throughout a life history.
Features of the microbiome in captive marmosets are also shared with human gut
microbiomes, including abundant populations of Bifidobacterium species. Our
studies show that several species of Bifidobacterium are dominant members of the 
captive marmoset microbiome throughout their life history. Metabolic capacities
in genomes of the marmoset Bifidobacterium species suggest species-specific
adaptations to different components of the captive marmoset diet, including the
unique capacity in B. aesculapii for degradation of gum arabic, suggesting that
regular dietary exposure in captivity may be important for preserving
gum-degrading species in the microbiome.

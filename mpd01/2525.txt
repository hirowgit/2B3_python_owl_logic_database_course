Paternal behaviour is critical for the survival of offspring in many monogamous
species. Common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) and cotton-top tamarin (Saguinus
oedipus) fathers spend as much or more time caring for infants than mothers.
Expectant males of both species showed significant increases in weight across the
pregnancy whereas control males did not (five consecutive months for marmoset
males and six months for cotton-top tamarin males). Expectant fathers might be
preparing for the energetic cost of fatherhood by gaining weight during their
mate's pregnancy.

Remyelination can be very effective in human. However, this process ultimately
fails in multiple sclerosis (MS). In this paper, we discuss the possibility of
stimulating endogenous oligodendrocyte precursors to participate in remyelination
in experimental models (rat and primate Callithrix jacchus) of MS through thyroid
hormone (TH) administration. TH is in fact known to be a key signal in brain
development, oligodendrocyte development and myelin protein gene expression
regulation.

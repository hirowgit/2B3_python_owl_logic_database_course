We use the common marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus) as a preclinical nonhuman 
primate model to study reproductive and stem cell biology. The neonatal marmoset 
monkey ovary contains numerous primitive premeiotic germ cells (oogonia)
expressing pluripotent stem cell markers including OCT4A (POU5F1). This is a
peculiarity compared to neonatal human and rodent ovaries. Here, we aimed at
culturing marmoset oogonia from neonatal ovaries. We established a culture system
being stable for more than 20 passages and 5 months. Importantly, comparative
transcriptome analysis of the cultured cells with neonatal ovary, embryonic stem 
cells, and fibroblasts revealed a lack of germ cell and pluripotency genes
indicating the complete loss of oogonia upon initiation of the culture. From
passage 4 onwards, however, the cultured cells produced large spherical,
free-floating cells resembling oocyte-like cells (OLCs). OLCs strongly expressed 
several germ cell genes and may derive from the ovarian surface epithelium. In
summary, our novel primate ovarian cell culture initially lacked detectable germ 
cells but then produced OLCs over a long period of time. This culture system may 
allow a deeper analysis of early phases of female primate germ cell development
and-after significant refinement-possibly also the production of monkey oocytes.

Bifidobacterium aesculapii DSM 26737(T) was isolated from feces of baby common
marmoset. Here, we report the draft genome sequence of this organism. This paper 
is the first published report of the genomic sequence of B. aesculapii.

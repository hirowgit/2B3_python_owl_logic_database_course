Enamel microstructure determination in hominoid and cercopithecoid primates.

Boyde A, Martin L.

Enamel structure was determined in primate teeth by scanning electron microscopy.
It was found that the important organisational features of this tissue can be
determined solely from the examination of developing material and that
significant differences in internal structure of the mature tissue are reflected 
in differences in the surface (cell-matrix interface) of the developing tissue.
Several very conservative, relatively non-destructive techniques can be used to
acquire information from fully formed teeth, whereas the examination of small
areas of heavily etched mature tissue samples may be inadequate or provide biased
or misleading information. Pattern 3 prism packing occurs predominantly in
Hominoidea, Pattern 2 in Cercopithecoidea. Pattern 1 was found in the one
callitricid and the one lemur specimen studied.

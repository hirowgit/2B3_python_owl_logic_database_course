The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a small-bodied New World primate that
is becoming an important model to study brain functions. Despite several studies 
exploring the somatosensory system of marmosets, all results have come from
anesthetized animals using invasive techniques and postmortem analyses. Here, we 
demonstrate the feasibility for getting high-quality and reproducible
somatosensory mapping in awake marmosets with functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI). We acquired fMRI sequences in four animals, while they received
tactile stimulation (via air-puffs), delivered to the face, arm, or leg. We found
a topographic body representation with the leg representation in the most medial 
part, the face representation in the most lateral part, and the arm
representation between leg and face representation within areas 3a, 3b, and 1/2. 
A similar sequence from leg to face from caudal to rostral sites was identified
in areas S2 and PV. By generating functional connectivity maps of seeds defined
in the primary and second somatosensory regions, we identified two clusters of
tactile representation within the posterior and midcingulate cortex. However,
unlike humans and macaques, no clear somatotopic maps were observed. At the
subcortical level, we found a somatotopic body representation in the thalamus
and, for the first time in marmosets, in the putamen. These maps have similar
organizations, as those previously found in Old World macaque monkeys and humans,
suggesting that these subcortical somatotopic organizations were already
established before Old and New World primates diverged. Our results show the
first whole brain mapping of somatosensory responses acquired in a noninvasive
way in awake marmosets.NEW & NOTEWORTHY We used somatosensory stimulation
combined with functional MRI (fMRI) in awake marmosets to reveal the topographic 
body representation in areas S1, S2, thalamus, and putamen. We showed the
existence of a body representation organization within the thalamus and the
cingulate cortex by computing functional connectivity maps from seeds defined in 
S1/S2, using resting-state fMRI data. This noninvasive approach will be essential
for chronic studies by guiding invasive recording and manipulation techniques.

Comment in
    Nat Rev Neurosci. 2021 Jan;22(1):4-5.

Stress-related disorders such as depression and anxiety are characterized by
enhanced negative emotion and physiological dysfunction. Whilst elevated activity
within area 25 of the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC/25) has been
implicated in these illnesses, it is unknown whether this over-activity is
causal. By combining targeted intracerebral microinfusions with cardiovascular
and behavioral monitoring in marmosets, we show that over-activation of sgACC/25 
reduces vagal tone and heart rate variability, alters cortisol dynamics during
stress and heightens reactivity to proximal and distal threat. 18F-FDG PET
imaging shows these changes are accompanied by altered activity within a network 
of brain regions including the amygdala, hypothalamus and dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex. Ketamine, shown to have rapid antidepressant effects, fails to reverse
elevated arousal to distal threat contrary to the beneficial effects we have
previously demonstrated on over-activation induced reward blunting, illustrating 
the symptom-specificity of its actions.

The marmoset has emerged as a promising primate model system, in particular for
visual neuroscience. Many common experimental paradigms rely on head fixation and
an extended period of eye fixation during the presentation of salient visual
stimuli. Both of these behavioral requirements can be challenging for marmosets. 
Here, we present two methodological developments, each addressing one of these
difficulties. First, we show that it is possible to use a standard eye-tracking
system without head fixation to assess visual behavior in the marmoset.
Eye-tracking quality from head-free animals is sufficient to obtain precise
psychometric functions from a visual acuity task. Second, we introduce a novel
method for efficient receptive field (RF) mapping that does not rely on moving
stimuli but uses fast flashing annuli and wedges. We present data recorded during
head-fixation in areas V1 and V6 and show that RF locations are readily obtained 
within a short period of recording time. Thus, the methodological advancements
presented in this work will contribute to establish the marmoset as a valuable
model in neuroscience.

Curiosity is a fundamental nature of animals for adapting to changing
environments, but its underlying brain circuits and mechanisms remain poorly
understood. One main barrier is that existing studies use rewards to train
animals and motivate their engagement in behavioral tasks. As such, the rewards
become significant confounders in interpreting curiosity. Here, we overcame this 
problem by studying research-naïve and naturally curious marmosets that can
proactively and persistently participate in a visual choice task without external
rewards. When performing the task, the marmosets manifested a strong innate
preference towards acquiring new information, associated with faster behavioral
responses. Longitudinally functional magnetic resonance imaging revealed
behavior-relevant brain states that reflected choice preferences and engaged
several brain regions, including the cerebellum, the hippocampus, and cortical
areas 19DI, 25, and 46D, with the cerebellum being the most prominent. These
results unveil the essential brain circuits and dynamics underlying
curiosity-driven activity.

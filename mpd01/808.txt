Despite drug advances for Hepatitis C virus (HCV), re-infections remain prevalent
in high-risk populations. Unfortunately, the role of preexisting viral immunity
and how it modulates re-infection is unclear. GBV-B infection of common marmosets
is a useful model to study tissue immune responses in hepacivirus infections, and
in this study we re-challenged 4 animals after clearance of primary viremia.
Although only low-to-absent viremia was observed following re-challenge, GBV-B
viral RNA was detectable in liver, confirming re-infection. Microscopic hepatic
lesions indicated severe-to-mild lymphocyte infiltration and fibrosis in 3 out of
4 animals. Further, GBV-B-specific T cells were elevated in animals with
moderate-to-severe hepatopathology, and up to 3-fold increases in myeloid
dendritic and activated natural killer cells were observed after infection. Our
data indicate that occult hepacivirus re-infections occur and that new liver
pathology is possible even in the presence of anti-hepacivirus T cells and in the
absence of high viremia.

Visual stimuli can evoke waves of neural activity that propagate across the
surface of visual cortical areas. The relevance of these waves for visual
processing is unknown. Here, we measured the phase and amplitude of local field
potentials (LFPs) in electrode array recordings from the motion-processing medial
temporal (MT) area of anesthetized male marmosets. Animals viewed grating or
dot-field stimuli drifting in different directions. We found that, on individual 
trials, the direction of LFP wave propagation is sensitive to the direction of
stimulus motion. Propagating LFP patterns are also detectable in trial-averaged
activity, but the trial-averaged patterns exhibit different dynamics and
behaviors from those in single trials and are similar across motion directions.
We show that this difference arises because stimulus-sensitive propagating
patterns are present in the phase of single-trial oscillations, whereas the
trial-averaged signal is dominated by additive amplitude effects. Our results
demonstrate that propagating LFP patterns can represent sensory inputs at
timescales relevant to visually guided behaviors and raise the possibility that
propagating activity patterns serve neural information processing in area MT and 
other cortical areas.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Propagating wave patterns are widely 
observed in the cortex, but their functional relevance remains unknown. We show
here that visual stimuli generate propagating wave patterns in local field
potentials (LFPs) in a movement-sensitive area of the primate cortex and that the
propagation direction of these patterns is sensitive to stimulus motion
direction. We also show that averaging LFP signals across multiple stimulus
presentations (trial averaging) yields propagating patterns that capture
different dynamic properties of the LFP response and show negligible direction
sensitivity. Our results demonstrate that sensory stimuli can modulate
propagating wave patterns reliably in the cortex. The relevant dynamics are
normally masked by trial averaging, which is a conventional step in LFP signal
processing.

Psychosis and dyskinesia significantly diminish the quality of life of patients
with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD). Available treatment options are
unfortunately few and their use is limited by adverse effects. We have recently
shown that activation of metabotropic glutamate 2 and 3 (mGlu2/3) receptors
produced significant relief of L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA)-induced
psychosis-like behaviours (PLBs) and dyskinesia in experimental models of PD.
Here, using the highly-selective mGlu2 positive allosteric modulator (PAM)
LY-487,379, we seek to determine the contribution of selective mGlu2 activation
on both L-DOPA-induced PLBs and dyskinesia, in the
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-lesioned primate. We first
determined the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of LY-487,379 in the common marmoset,
following which we administered it (0.1, 1 and 10 mg/kg) or its vehicle to 6
MPTP-lesioned marmosets previously exposed to L-DOPA to elicit stable PLBs and
dyskinesia. We found that LY-487,379 provided a ≈45% reduction of the global PLBs
observed and reduced global dyskinesia score by ≈ 55%. Moreover, LY-487,379
enhanced the anti-parkinsonian effect of L-DOPA, by reducing global parkinsonian 
score by ≈ 15%. Our data suggest that selective mGlu2 positive allosteric
modulation with LY-487,379 may represent a potential therapeutic approach to
alleviate both L-DOPA-induced PLBs and dyskinesia in PD.

Common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is an attractive animal model primate
species for potential use in drug metabolism and pharmacokinetic studies. In this
study, marmoset cytochrome P450 (P450) 2S1, 4V2, 7A1, 7B1, 8B1, 24A1, 26A1, 26C1,
27A1, 39A1, and 51A1 cDNAs were isolated from marmoset tissues (brains, lungs,
livers, kidneys, and jejunums). Deduced amino acid sequences (89-98% homologous) 
of the marmoset P450 gene suggested similarity of molecular characteristics of
marmoset P450s to human counterparts, compared with those of pig, rabbit, and
rodents. Phylogenetic analysis using amino acid sequences indicated 11 marmoset
P450 forms clustered with those of human and other primate counterparts,
suggesting marmoset P450s have an evolutionary close relationship to human and
other primate counterparts. Tissue expression patterns of these P450 mRNAs except
for P450 7B1 mRNA were generally similar to those of human P450s in the five
tissue types analyzed. These results suggest similarity of molecular
characteristics for P450 2S1, 4V2, 7A1, 7B1, 8B1, 24A1, 26A1, 26C1, 27A1, 39A1,
and 51A1 between marmosets and humans, in addition to the orthologs of human P450
1, 2, 3, and 4 families previously identified and characterized in marmosets.

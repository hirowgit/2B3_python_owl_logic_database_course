The ubiquitous presence of inhibitory interneurons in the thalamus of primates
contrasts with the sparsity of interneurons reported in mice. Here, we identify a
larger than expected complexity and distribution of interneurons across the mouse
thalamus, where all thalamic interneurons can be traced back to two developmental
programmes: one specified in the midbrain and the other in the forebrain.
Interneurons migrate to functionally distinct thalamocortical nuclei depending on
their origin: the abundant, midbrain-derived class populates the first and higher
order sensory thalamus while the rarer, forebrain-generated class is restricted
to some higher order associative regions. We also observe that markers for the
midbrain-born class are abundantly expressed throughout the thalamus of the New
World monkey marmoset. These data therefore reveal that, despite the broad
variability in interneuron density across mammalian species, the blueprint of the
ontogenetic organisation of thalamic interneurons of larger-brained mammals
exists and can be studied in mice.

Hyperadrenocorticism is a medical condition caused by the increase in cortisol
production by the cortex of the adrenal gland. Although infrequently described in
most animal species, its naturally occurring form, called Cushing's syndrome, is 
the most prevalent endocrinopathy in dogs. Cushing's syndrome is also present in 
humans and might be confused with the pseudo-Cushing's syndrome (PCS), rarely
described in animals. PCS shares many of the clinical and biochemical features of
Cushing's syndrome. However, the hypercortisolemia seen is usually idiopathic
and, in some circumstances, associated with psychological disruptions. This
report describes PCS-like disorder in two marmosets Callithrix aurita that were
exposed to environmental changes, suggesting stress as the main cause of the
process and reviewing the mechanisms involved in the pathogeny of the two
syndromes.

INTRODUCTION: The morphological study of wild animals serves as a base for more
advanced studies in clinical medicine, surgery, and pathology. Due to an urgent
need and demand for professionals specialized in this area, studies of this
nature have become indispensable and so the objective of the present study was to
describe the heart morphology of Callithrix jacchus.
METHODS: Ten anatomic pieces of common marmoset were used. The hearts were
removed and dissected for better visualization and thus to makes a detailed
description of the structures of the organ of the C jacchus species.
RESULTS: The C jacchus heart is similar to that of other mammals, with small
anatomical modifications such as division of the apex by the interventricular
grooves, shallow fossa ovalis, and less salient intervenous tubercle.
CONCLUSIONS: This study may serve as taxonomic base for research and also as a
basis for clinical and surgical procedures with the C jacchus.

The oxytocin-arginine vasopressin (OT-AVP) ligand-receptor family influences a
variety of physiological, behavioral, and social behavioral processes in the
brain and periphery. The OT-AVP family is highly conserved in mammals, but recent
discoveries have revealed remarkable diversity in OT ligands and receptors in New
World Monkeys (NWMs) providing a unique opportunity to assess the effects of
genetic variation on pharmacological signatures of peptide ligands. The consensus
mammalian OT sequence has leucine in the 8th position (Leu8-OT), whereas a number
of NWMs, including the marmoset, have proline in the 8th position (Pro8-OT)
resulting in a more rigid tail structure. OT and AVP bind to OT's cognate
G-protein coupled receptor (OTR), which couples to various G-proteins (Gi/o, Gq, 
Gs) to stimulate diverse signaling pathways. CHO cells expressing marmoset
(mOTR), titi monkey (tOTR), macaque (qOTR), or human (hOTR) OT receptors were
used to compare AVP and OT analog-induced signaling. Assessment of Gq-mediated
increase in intracellular calcium (Ca2+) demonstrated that AVP was less potent
than OT analogs at OTRs from species whose endogenous ligand is Leu8-OT (tOTR,
qOTR, hOTR), relative to Pro8-OT. Likewise, AVP-induced membrane
hyperpolarization was less potent at these same OTRs. Evaluation of
(Ca2+)-activated potassium (K+) channels using the inhibitors apamin, paxilline, 
and TRAM-34 demonstrated that both intermediate and large conductance
Ca2+-activated K+ channels contributed to membrane hyperpolarization, with
different pharmacological profiles identified for distinct ligand-receptor
combinations. Understanding more fully the contributions of structure activity
relationships for these peptide ligands at vasopressin and OT receptors will help
guide the development of OT-mediated therapeutics.

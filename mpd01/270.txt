The pulvinar, the largest thalamic nucleus in the primate brain, has connections 
with a variety of cortical areas and is involved in many aspects of higher brain 
functions. Among cortico-pulvino-cortical systems, the connection between the
middle temporal area (MT) and the pulvinar has been thought to contribute
significantly to complex motion recognition. Recently, the common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus), has become a valuable model for a variety of neuroscience
studies, including visual neuroscience and translational research of neurological
and psychiatric disorders. However, information on projections from MT to the
pulvinar in the marmoset brain is scant. We addressed this deficiency by
injecting sensitive anterograde viral tracers into MT to examine the distribution
of labeled terminations in the pulvinar. The injection sites were placed
retinotopically according to visual field coordinates mapped by optical intrinsic
imaging. All injections produced anterograde terminal labeling, which was densest
in the medial nucleus of the inferior pulvinar (PIm), sparser in the central
nucleus of the inferior pulvinar, and weakest in the lateral pulvinar. Within
each subnucleus, terminations formed separate retinotopic fields. Most labeled
terminals were small but these comingled with a few large terminals, distributed 
mainly in the dorsomedial part of the PIm. Our results further delineate the
organization of projections from MT to the pulvinar in the marmoset as forming
parallel complex networks, which may differentially contribute to motion
processing. It is interesting that the densest projections from MT target the
PIm, the subnucleus recently reported to preferentially receive direct retinal
projections.

There is limited available information concerning the prevalence of Toxoplasma
gondii in noncaptive monkeys. Also, New World monkeys (NWM) are highly
susceptible to toxoplasmosis, which is a conservation concern. This study aimed
to investigate apicomplexan parasites in common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus)
collected for yellow fever and rabies surveillance program in Northeastern region
of Brazil. Heart fragments of 39 free-ranging common marmosets were analyzed for 
the presence of the 18S rDNA gene of apicomplexan parasites by nested PCR.
Positive samples were sequenced. T. gondii DNA was detected in 17.9% (7/39) of
the analyzed animals. This study is the first report on T. gondii in Callithrix
jacchus in Brazil. These findings should be an alert for wildlife conservation
institutions, as high susceptibility and mortality were reported for captive NWM.

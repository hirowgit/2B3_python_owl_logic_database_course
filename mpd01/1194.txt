Adult born neurons in the hippocampus show species-specific differences in their 
numbers, the pace of their maturation and their spatial distribution. Here, we
present quantitative data on adult hippocampal neurogenesis in a New World
primate, the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) that demonstrate parts of the
lineage progression and age-related changes. Proliferation was largely (∼70%)
restricted to stem cells or early progenitor cells, whilst the remainder of the
cycling pool could be assigned almost exclusively to Tbr2+ intermediate precursor
cells in both neonate and adult animals (20-122 months). Proliferating DCX+
neuroblasts were virtually absent in adults, although rare MCM2+/DCX+
co-expression revealed a small, persisting proliferative potential. Co-expression
of DCX with calretinin was very limited in marmosets, suggesting that these
markers label distinct maturational stages. In adult marmosets, numbers of MCM2+,
Ki67+, and significantly Tbr2+, DCX+, and CR+ cells declined with age. The
distributions of granule cells, proliferating cells and DCX+ young neurons along 
the hippocampal longitudinal axis were equal in marmosets and mice. In both
species, a gradient along the hippocampal septo-temporal axis was apparent for
DCX+ and resident granule cells. Both cell numbers are higher septally than
temporally, whilst proliferating cells were evenly distributed along this axis.
Relative to resident granule cells, however, the ratio of proliferating cells and
DCX+ neurons remained constant in the septal, middle, and temporal hippocampus.
In marmosets, the extended phase of the maturation of young neurons that
characterizes primate hippocampal neurogenesis was due to the extension in a
large CR+/DCX- cell population. This clear dissociation between DCX+ and CR+
young neurons has not been reported for other species and may therefore represent
a key primate-specific feature of adult hippocampal neurogenesis.

OBJECTIVES: Platyrrhines span two orders of magnitude in body size and are
characterized by diverse feeding behaviors and diets. While size plays an
important role in primate feeding behavior and masticatory apparatus morphology, 
we know little about size-correlated changes in the force-generating (physiologic
cross-sectional area; PCSA) and excursion/stretch (fiber length; Lf )
capabilities of the jaw-closing muscles in platyrrhines.
METHODS: We examined scaling relationships of the superficial masseter and
temporalis muscles in 21 platyrrhine species. Previous work suggests that larger 
platyrrhines are at a mechanical disadvantage for generating bite forces compared
with smaller platyrrhines. We hypothesize that scaling of jaw-muscle fiber
architecture counters this size-correlated decrease in mechanical advantage.
Thus, we predicted that jaw-muscle PCSAs and muscle weights scale with positive
allometry while Lf s scale with negative allometry, relative to load-arm
estimates for incisor/molar biting and chewing.
RESULTS: Jaw-muscle PCSAs and Lf s appear to scale with negative allometry
relative to load-arm estimates and body size. Negative allometry of jaw-muscle
weights partially accounts for the size-correlated decreases in PCSA and Lf .
Estimates of bite force also scale with negative allometry.
CONCLUSION: Large-bodied platyrrhines (e.g., Alouatta) are at a relative
disadvantage for generating jaw-muscle and bite force as well as jaw-muscle
stretch, compared with smaller species (e.g., Callithrix). The net effect is that
larger platyrrhines likely produce relatively smaller maximal bite forces
compared with smaller taxa. Relative to small- and intermediate-sized
platyrrhines, large-bodied platyrrhines feed on some of the least mechanically
challenging foods, consistent with the size-correlated decrease in relative
muscle and bite forces across the clade. Am J Phys Anthropol, 2015. © 2015 Wiley

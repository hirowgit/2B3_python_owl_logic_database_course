Ultrastructural aspects of spermatogenesis in the common marmoset (Callithrix
jacchus).

Holt WV, Moore HD.

The pattern of normal spermatogenesis in the common marmoset, Callithrix jacchus,
is described and a system classifying the spermatogenic cycle into nine
successive stages is presented. In contrast to most previous studies of
spermatogenesis, the classification system developed in this study depends more
upon the recognition of characteristic cell associations rather than upon
identification of particular steps of spermatid development. The structurally
simple acrosome of the marmoset spermatozoon displays insufficiently clear
morphological changes during spermatid elongation to allow this to be used as a
key to spermatogenic classification. Ultrastructural aspects of spermatogenesis
in the marmoset are also described; in general, these correspond to similar
descriptions of this process in other primates.

We examined the usefulness of commercially available DNA methylation arrays
designed for the human genome (Illumina HumanMethylation450 and MethylationEPIC) 
for high-throughput epigenome analysis of the common marmoset, a nonhuman primate
suitable for research on neuropsychiatric disorders. From among the probes on the
methylation arrays, we selected those available for the common marmoset. DNA
methylation data were obtained from genomic DNA extracted from the frontal cortex
and blood samples of adult common marmosets as well as the frontal cortex of
neonatal marmosets. About 10% of the probes on the arrays were estimated to be
useful for DNA methylation assay in the common marmoset. Strong correlations
existed between human and marmoset DNA methylation data. Illumina methylation
arrays are useful for epigenome research using the common marmoset.

Generation of nonhuman primate models of human disease conditions will foster the
development of novel therapeutic strategies. Callithrix jacchus, or the common
marmoset, is a New World, nonhuman primate species that exhibits great
reproductive fitness in captivity with an ovarian cycle that can be easily
managed with pharmacological agents. This characteristic, among others, provides 
an opportunity to employ assisted reproductive technologies to generate embryos
that can be genetically manipulated to create a variety of nonhuman primate
models for human disease. Here, we review methods to synchronize the marmoset
ovarian cycle and stimulate oocyte donors, and compare various protocols for in
vitro production of embryos. In light of advances in genomic editing, recent
approaches used to generate transgenic or genetically edited embryos in the
marmoset and also future perspective are reviewed.

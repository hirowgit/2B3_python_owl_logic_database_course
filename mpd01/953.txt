BACKGROUND: Common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) and cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca 
fascicularis) are used as non-human primate models in preclinical studies for
drug development.
OBJECTIVE: The assessment of P450 induction in hepatocytes from marmosets and
cynomolgus monkeys was performed using typical P450 inducers.
METHODS: Induction of cytochrome P450 1-4 family enzymes was analyzed in two lots
of cultured hepatocytes from common marmosets and cynomolgus monkeys after 24-h
treatment with typical human P450 inducing agents by real-time reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction.
RESULTS: Marmoset P450 3A4 mRNA and P450 2C8/2C19 mRNA in hepatocytes were
strongly (>10- fold) and weakly (>2) induced by rifampicin, respectively.
Marmoset 1A1 and 1A2 mRNA were induced strongly (>200-fold) by β-naphthoflavone
and omeprazole. Marmoset P450 2B6 mRNA was induced (~5-fold) by a constitutive
androstane receptor agonist, but not by phenobarbital. Cynomolgus monkey P450 3A4
mRNA and P450 1A1 mRNA in cultured hepatocytes were also induced by rifampicin
and omeprazole, respectively, but P450 2B6 mRNA was not induced by phenobarbital.
CONCLUSION: These results indicate that P450 1A/3A induction by typical human
P450 inducers in hepatocytes from marmosets and/or cynomolgus monkeys are similar
to those of humans (except for P450 2B induction by phenobarbital in humans),
suggesting that marmosets and cynomolgus monkeys might be suitable models for
evaluating the drug interactions in preclinical studies.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is thought to be initiated by the interaction of genetic 
and environmental factors, eliciting an autoimmune attack on the central nervous 
system. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is the strongest infectious risk factor, but an 
explanation for the paradox between high infection prevalence and low MS
incidence remains elusive. We discuss new data using marmosets with experimental 
autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) - a valid primate model of MS. The findings
may help to explain how a common infection can contribute to the pathogenesis of 
MS. We propose that EBV infection induces citrullination of peptides in
conjunction with autophagy during antigen processing, endowing B cells with the
capacity to cross-present autoantigen to CD8+CD56+ T cells, thereby leading to MS
progression.

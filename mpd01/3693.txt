A pre-gamma-globin species was identified by high performance liquid
chromatography in platyrrhine primates. Although pre-gamma-globin has not been
observed in human hemoglobin, its identification in platyrrhine hemoglobin was
facilitated by the functional inactivation of one of the duplicated gamma-globin 
genes in platyrrhines, which simplified the high performance liquid
chromatography elution pattern. Part, but not all, of the pre-gamma was
glutathionyl gamma 2-globin, and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass
spectrometry was used to demonstrate that the glutathionyl residue was located on
cysteine 93. As this residue is invariant in primates, it is predicted that the
formation of glutathionyl gamma-globin will be seen in all primate hemoglobins
under appropriate conditions.

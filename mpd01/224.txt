BACKGROUND: The successive reports of Platynosomum illiciens in Neotropical
captive primates have increased interest in platynosomosis; however, its
treatment is little known.
METHODS: Callithrix penicillata (n = 10) naturally and chronically infected with 
P. illiciens were treated with praziquantel (25 mg/kg BW, three s.c. doses at
24 hours intervals), and coproparasitological tests performed over 67 days. The
proportions of primates with a reduction in fecal egg counts (FEC) or negative
results progressively increased after treatment, and at the last fecal tests,
marmosets were negative.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Although all primates tolerated the initial days of
study well, 40% (4/10) of them died between the 8th and 16th days after the onset
of treatment. Clinical signs and necropsies indicated the occurrence of hepatic
involvement, biliary obstruction, and cholangitis. Marmosets with a higher
previous FEC were more likely to die after treatment. Use of praziquantel should 
be considered carefully on a case-by-case basis.

HLA-F represents one of the nonclassical MHC class I molecules in humans. Its
main characteristics involve low levels of polymorphism in combination with a
restricted tissue distribution. This signals that the gene product executes a
specialised function, which, however, is still poorly understood. Relatively
little is known about the evolutionary equivalents of this gene in nonhuman
primates, especially with regard to population data. Here we report a comparative
genetic analysis of the orthologous genes of HLA-F in various great ape, Old
World monkey (OWM), and New World monkey (NWM) species. HLA-F-related transcripts
were found in all subjects studied. Low levels of polymorphism were encountered, 
although the length of the predicted gene products may vary. In most species, one
or two transcripts were discovered, indicating the presence of only one active
F-like gene per chromosome. An exception was provided by a New World monkey
species, namely, the common marmoset. In this species, the gene has been subject 
to duplication, giving rise to up to six F-like transcripts per animal. In
humans, great apes, and OWM, and probably the majority of the NWM species, the
evolutionary equivalents of the HLA-F gene experienced purifying selection. In
the marmoset, however, the gene was initially duplicated, but the expansion was
subjected afterwards to various mechanisms of genetic inactivation, as evidenced 
by the presence of pseudogenes and an array of genetic artefacts in a section of 
the transcripts.

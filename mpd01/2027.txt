OBJECTIVE: Mumps virus is isolated in Vero cells and, recently, B95a cells have
been reported to be susceptible to it. Currently circulating wild-type mumps
virus strains (genotypes B, G, J and L) induced cytopathic effects in both Vero
and B95a cells. On the other hand, the Hoshino vaccine strain (KO3) did not
induce cytopathic effects in B95a cells. In this study, differences in fusion
inducibility were investigated.
METHODS: Nucleotide sequences of the fusion (F) and hemagglutinin-neuraminidase
(HN) protein regions were compared. The F and HN expression plasmids were
constructed and fusion analysis was conducted, using recombinant F expression
plasmids under the control of T7 RNA polymerase.
RESULTS: Extensive cell fusion was observed when B95a cells were transfected with
the wild-type F expression plasmid as the F expression partner; 13-16 amino acid 
differences were observed in the F protein region between the KO3 and the wild
types. F expression plasmids with leucine at position 383 of the F protein
induced large cell fusion in B95a cells.
CONCLUSION: Leucine at position 383 of the F protein of the wild types was the
critical amino acid for fusion inducibility in B95a cells.

BACKGROUND: Synthetic glucocorticoids such as dexamethasone (DEX) are commonly
used to promote fetal lung maturation in at-risk preterm births, but there is
emerging evidence of subsequent neurobehavioral abnormalities in these children
e.g. problems with inattention/hyperactivity. However, molecular pathways
mediating effects of glucocorticoid overexposure on motor and cognitive
development are poorly understood.
METHODS: In this study with common marmoset monkeys, we investigated for neonatal
and adulthood effects of antenatal DEX treatment on the expression of the
corticosteroid receptors and also calcyon, a risk gene for
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, in the prefrontal cortex (PFC).
Pregnant marmosets were exposed to DEX (5 mg/kg body weight) or vehicle during
early (days 42-48) or late (days 90-96) stages of the 144-day pregnancy.
RESULTS: In neonates, relative to controls, glucocorticoid receptor (GR) mRNA
levels were significantly reduced after the late DEX treatment in the medial,
orbital and dorsal PFC and after the early DEX treatment in the dorsal PFC. The
early DEX exposure, specifically, resulted in significant reduction in calcyon
mRNA expression in the medial, orbital, dorsal and lateral PFC relative to
controls. Mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) mRNA levels were not significantly
affected by DEX treatment. In adults, PFC GR, calcyon, and MR mRNA levels were
not significantly affected by early or late prenatal DEX treatment.
CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that antenatal DEX treatment could lead to
short-term alterations in PFC expression of the GR and calcyon genes, with
possible neurodevelopmental functional consequences.

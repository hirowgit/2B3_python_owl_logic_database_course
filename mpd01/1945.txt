OBJECTIVE: To establish a nonhuman primate model addressing follicular
development in cryopreserved prepubertal ovarian tissue after xenografting.
DESIGN: Experimental study.
SETTING: Academic research center.
ANIMAL(S): Ovarian tissue from female prepubertal common marmoset (Callytrix
jacchus jacchus) grafted into immunodeficient nude mice (Crl:NU-FoxnI(nu)).
INTERVENTION(S): Removal and subsequent cryopreservation of ovarian tissues with 
dimethyl sulfoxide, followed by grafting to subcutaneous sites of ovariectomized 
and intact nude mice.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Histologic evaluation for the mean number of total and
morphologically normal follicles in each class.
RESULT(S): The mean number of unadvanced follicles in frozen-thawed grafted
ovarian tissues was reduced compared with pregraft controls, but the prevalence
of normal follicular morphology was either slightly increased (primordial
follicles) or unchanged (primary follicles). Previous ovariectomy in graft
recipients increased total follicle numbers without effect on normal follicular
morphology and shifted the ratio of primordial to primary follicles toward an
increase in primary follicles, indicating activation of follicular maturation.
CONCLUSION(S): The marmoset is a suitable primate model for studies on the
subsequent use of cryopreserved ovarian tissue, demonstrating graft sustainment
and the development of follicles from prepubertal ovarian tissue in
immunodeficient hosts up to secondary and preantral stages.

When play is a family business: adult play, hierarchy, and possible stress
reduction in common marmosets.

Easy to recognize but not easy to define, animal play is a baffling behavior
because it has no obvious immediate benefits for the performers. However, the
absence of immediate advantages, if true, would leave adult play (costly but
maintained by evolution, spanning lemurs to Homo sapiens) unexplained. Although a
commonly held view maintains that play is limited by stress, an emergent
hypothesis states that play can regulate stress in the short term. Here we
explored this hypothesis in a captive family group of New World monkeys,
Callithrix jacchus (common marmoset). We observed six subjects and gathered data 
on aggressive, play, and scratching behavior via focal (6 h/individual) and all
occurrences sampling (115 h). We found that play levels were highest during
pre-feeding, the period of maximum anxiety due to the forthcoming competition
over food. Scratching (the most reliable indicator of stress in primates) and
play showed opposite trends along hierarchy, with dominants scratching more and
playing less than subordinates. Finally, scratching decreased after play, whereas
play appeared to be unrelated to previous scratching events, symptoms of a
potential stressful state. In conclusion, both play timing and hierarchical
distribution indicate that play limits stress, more than vice versa, at least in 
the short term.

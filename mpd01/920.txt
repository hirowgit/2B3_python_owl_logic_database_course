BACKGROUND: Licensed antiviral therapeutics and vaccines to protect against
eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) in humans currently do not exist. Animal
models that faithfully recapitulate the clinical characteristics of human EEEV
encephalitic disease, including fever, drowsiness, anorexia, and neurological
signs such as seizures, are needed to satisfy requirements of the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) for clinical product licensing under the Animal Rule.
METHODS: In an effort to meet this requirement, we estimated the median lethal
dose and described the pathogenesis of aerosolized EEEV in the common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus). Five marmosets were exposed to aerosolized EEEV FL93-939 in
doses ranging from 2.4 × 101 PFU to 7.95 × 105 PFU.
RESULTS: The median lethal dose was estimated to be 2.05 × 102 PFU. Lethality was
observed as early as day 4 post-exposure in the highest-dosed marmoset but
animals at lower inhaled doses had a protracted disease course where humane study
endpoint was not met until as late as day 19 post-exposure. Clinical signs were
observed as early as 3 to 4 days post-exposure, including fever, ruffled fur,
decreased grooming, and leukocytosis. Clinical signs increased in severity as
disease progressed to include decreased body weight, subdued behavior, tremors,
and lack of balance. Fever was observed as early as day 2-3 post-exposure in the 
highest dose groups and hypothermia was observed in several cases as animals
became moribund. Infectious virus was found in several key tissues, including
brain, liver, kidney, and several lymph nodes. Clinical hematology results
included early neutrophilia, lymphopenia, and thrombocytopenia. Key pathological 
changes included meningoencephalitis and retinitis. Immunohistochemical staining 
for viral antigen was positive in the brain, retina, and lymph nodes. More
intense and widespread IHC labeling occurred with increased aerosol dose.
CONCLUSION: We have estimated the medial lethal dose of aerosolized EEEV and
described the pathology of clinical disease in the marmoset model. The results
demonstrate that the marmoset is an animal model suitable for emulation of human 
EEEV disease in the development of medical countermeasures.

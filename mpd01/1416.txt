Some recombinant adeno-associated viruses (rAAVs) can cross the neonatal
blood-brain barrier (BBB) and efficiently transduce cells of the central nervous 
system (CNS). However, in the adult CNS, transduction levels by systemically
delivered rAAVs are significantly reduced, limiting their potential for CNS gene 
therapy. Here, we characterized 12 different rAAVEGFPs in the adult mouse CNS
following intravenous delivery. We show that the capability of crossing the adult
BBB and achieving widespread CNS transduction is a common character of AAV
serotypes tested. Of note, rAAVrh.8 is the leading vector for robust global
transduction of glial and neuronal cell types in regions of clinical importance
such as cortex, caudate-putamen, hippocampus, corpus callosum, and substantia
nigra. It also displays reduced peripheral tissue tropism compared to other
leading vectors. Additionally, we evaluated rAAVrh.10 with and without microRNA
(miRNA)-regulated expressional detargeting from peripheral tissues for systemic
gene delivery to the CNS in marmosets. Our results indicate that rAAVrh.8, along 
with rh.10 and 9, hold the best promise for developing novel therapeutic
strategies to treat neurological diseases in the adult patient population.
Additionally, systemically delivered rAAVrh.10 can transduce the CNS efficiently,
and its transgene expression can be limited in the periphery by endogenous miRNAs
in adult marmosets.

Language is a characteristic feature of human communication. Several familial
language impairments have been identified, and candidate genes for language
impairments already isolated. Studies comparing expression patterns of these
genes in human brain are necessary to further understanding of these genes.
However, it is difficult to examine gene expression in human brain. In this
study, we used a non-human primate (common marmoset; Callithrix jacchus) as a
biological model of the human brain to investigate expression patterns of human
speech- and reading-related genes. Expression patterns of speech disorder-
(FoxP2, FoxP1, CNTNAP2, and CMIP) and dyslexia- (ROBO1, DCDC2, and KIAA0319)
related genes were analyzed. We found the genes displayed overlapping expression 
patterns in the ocular, auditory, and motor systems. Our results enhance
understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying language impairments.

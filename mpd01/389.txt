The hippocampus comprises two neural signals-place cells and θ oscillations-that 
contribute to facets of spatial navigation. Although their complementary
relationship has been well established in rodents, their respective contributions
in the primate brain during free navigation remains unclear. Here, we recorded
neural activity in the hippocampus of freely moving marmosets as they naturally
explored a spatial environment to more explicitly investigate this issue. We
report place cells in marmoset hippocampus during free navigation that exhibit
remarkable parallels to analogous neurons in other mammalian species. Although θ 
oscillations were prevalent in the marmoset hippocampus, the patterns of activity
were notably different than in other taxa. This local field potential oscillation
occurred in short bouts (approximately .4 s)-rather than continuously-and was
neither significantly modulated by locomotion nor consistently coupled to
place-cell activity. These findings suggest that the relationship between
place-cell activity and θ oscillations in primate hippocampus during free
navigation differs substantially from rodents and paint an intriguing comparative
picture regarding the neural basis of spatial navigation across mammals.

Centromere protein B (CENP-B), a protein participating in centromere formation,
binds to centromere satellite DNA by recognizing a 17-bp motif called the CENP-B 
box. This motif is found in hominids (humans and great apes) at an identical
location in repeat units of their centromere satellite DNA. We have recently
reported that the CENP-B box exists at diverse locations in three New World
monkey species (marmoset, squirrel monkey and tamarin). However, the evolutionary
origin of the CENP-B box in these species was not determined. It could have been 
present in a common ancestor, or emerged multiple times in different lineages.
Here we present results of a phylogenetic analysis of centromere satellite DNA
that support the multiple emergence hypothesis. Repeat units almost invariably
formed monophyletic groups in each species and the CENP-B box location was unique
for each species. The CENP-B box is not essential for the immediate survival of
its host organism. On the other hand, it is known to be required for de novo
centromere assembly. Our results suggest that the CENP-B box confers a long-term 
selective advantage. For example, it may play a pivotal role when a centromere is
accidentally lost or impaired.

Owing to genotype-specific neutralizing antibodies, analyzing differences in the 
immunogenic variation among dengue virus (DENV) genotypes is central to effective
vaccine development. Herein, we characterized the viral kinetics and antibody
response induced by DENV type 2 Asian I (AI) and Asian/American (AA) genotypes
using marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) as models. Two groups of marmosets were
inoculated with AI and AA genotypes, and serial plasma samples were collected.
Viremia levels were determined using quantitative reverse transcription-PCR,
plaque assays, and antigen enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Anti-DENV
immunoglobulin M and G antibodies, neutralizing antibody titer, and
antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) activity were determined using ELISA, plaque
reduction neutralization test, and ADE assay, respectively. The AI genotype
induced viremia for a longer duration, but the AA genotype induced higher levels 
of viremia. After four months, the neutralizing antibody titer induced by the AA 
genotype remained high, but that induced by the AI genotype waned. ADE activity
toward Cosmopolitan genotypes was detected in marmosets inoculated with the AI
genotype. These findings indicate discrepancies between heterologous genotypes
that influence neutralizing antibodies and viremia in marmosets, a critical issue
in vaccine development.

Astrocytes play critical roles after brain injury, but their precise function is 
poorly defined. Utilizing single-nuclei transcriptomics to characterize
astrocytes after ischemic stroke in the visual cortex of the marmoset monkey, we 
observed nearly complete segregation between stroke and control astrocyte
clusters. Screening for the top 30 differentially expressed genes that might
limit stroke recovery, we discovered that a majority of astrocytes expressed
RTN4A/ NogoA, a neurite-outgrowth inhibitory protein previously only associated
with oligodendrocytes. NogoA upregulation on reactive astrocytes post-stroke was 
significant in both the marmoset and human brain, whereas only a marginal change 
was observed in mice. We determined that NogoA mediated an anti-inflammatory
response which likely contributes to limiting the infiltration of peripheral
macrophages into the surviving parenchyma.

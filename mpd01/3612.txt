Cerebral cortical maps in adult primates reorganize within minutes-hours after
peripheral injuries, but subcortical versus intracortical contributions to this
rapid reorganization remain controversial. The present results show that injury
of nerves to the hands of adult monkeys triggers rapid (minutes-hours) changes in
maps of the hand in the brainstem main cuneate nucleus. These findings suggest
that peripheral injury causes an initial concurrent reorganization of brainstem
and cortical substrates and that early sensory changes emerge from reorganization
involving multiple central levels.

The mortal cause of black-tufted-ear marmoset (Callithrix penicillata), living in
a conservation unit of State Park of Serra da Tiririca-Niter처i-RJ, Brasilien, has
been investigated in 1995 based on different examinations realized in one animal.
After clinical, light and electron microscopic investigations, herpesvirus
infection was found to be the etiological agent of the disease.

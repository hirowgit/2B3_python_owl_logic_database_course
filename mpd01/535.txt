Pseudotyped lentiviral vectors give access to pathway-selective gene manipulation
via retrograde transfer. Two types of such lentiviral vectors have been
developed. One is the so-called NeuRet vector pseudotyped with fusion
glycoprotein type E, which preferentially transduces neurons. The other is the
so-called HiRet vector pseudotyped with fusion glycoprotein type B2, which
permits gene transfer into both neurons and glial cells at the injection site.
Although these vectors have been applied in many studies investigating neural
network functions, it remains unclear which vector is more appropriate for
retrograde gene delivery in the brain. To compare the gene transfer efficiency
and inflammatory response of the NeuRet vs. HiRet vectors, each vector was
injected into the striatum in macaque monkeys, common marmosets, and rats. It was
revealed that retrograde gene delivery of the NeuRet vector was equal to or
greater than that of the HiRet vector. Furthermore, inflammation characterized by
microglial and lymphocytic infiltration occurred when the HiRet vector, but not
the NeuRet vector, was injected into the primate brain. The present results
indicate that the NeuRet vector is more suitable than the HiRet vector for
retrograde gene transfer in the primate and rodent brains.

Immediate early genes (IEGs) are a fundamental element in the way we respond and 
adapt to a variety of stimuli. We have recently reported that IEG response, as
measured by c-Fos expression, is different between rodents and primates. Here, we
further extend this analysis by assessing the expression of c-Jun, one of the
main complements of c-Fos, under the same stimulation protocol. For this, we
investigated the immunohistochemical expression of c-Jun (and compared with that 
previously shown for c-Fos) after stimulation with pentylenetetrazol in the
cingulate gyrus, motor cortex, piriform cortex, inferior temporal cortex, and
visual cortex of rats and marmosets (Callithrix jacchus), both male and female.
Overall the immunohistochemical expression of c-Jun was more intense but remained
elevated for a shorter duration in marmosets as compared to rats. These results
are in contrast to what we had previously shown for c-Fos. Furthermore, in terms 
of the temporal profile, c-Fos and c-Jun expression occurred in a complementary
manner in rats-the peak of c-Fos expression coincided with low levels of c-jun
expression-and in a superimposed manner in marmosets-the peak of c-Fos expression
coincided with the peak of c-Jun expression. Since Fos proteins may form dimers
with Jun proteins and together control late gene expressions in the cell nucleus,
this different expression profile between primates and rodents may bear
meaningful impact for how the nervous system reacts and adapts to stimulation.

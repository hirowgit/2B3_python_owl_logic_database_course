Skeletal development in the foetal and neonatal marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).

Phillips IR.

Qualitative and quantitative measurements of skeletal development were performed 
on foetal marmosets in utero and on fixed specimens of both foetuses and
neonates. The sequence of skeletal changes may be used to assess developmental
status and the prenatal growth of the marmoset is compared with that of other
primate species.

Epstein-Barr virus: experimental infection of Callithrix jacchus marmosets.

Falk L, Deinhardt F, Wolfe L, Johnson D, Hilgers J, de-Th√© G.

Eight common marmoset monkeys (Callithrix jacchus) were inoculated with about
10(4) transforming units of B95-8 virus; seven of the marmosets died 50-111 days 
post inoculation and all seven showed microscopic and/or macroscopic lesions
compatible with a diagnosis of lymphoproliferative disease. Low levels of
anti-VCA antibodies were detected in plasma from six marmosets. Attempts failed
to establish continuous EBV-carrying lymphoblastoid cell cultures by cultivation 
in vitro of circulating lymphocytes or minced lymphoid tissues obtained at
necropsy.

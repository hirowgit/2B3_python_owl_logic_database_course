Membrane cofactor protein (MCP; CD46) regulates the complement cascade by
inhibiting C3b and C4b deposited on self tissue. This function resides in the
complement control protein repeats (CCPs), with CCPs 2-4 essential for
regulation. MCP is expressed on the inner acrosomal membrane of human sperm, and 
Abs to CCP1 inhibit sperm-egg interactions. In somatic tissues, New World monkeys
express an alternatively spliced form of MCP lacking CCP1. Although retaining
complement-regulatory activity, this form is postulated to render these species
less susceptible to strains of the measles virus whose hemagglutinin requires
CCP1 and CCP2 for attachment. Using PCR, sequencing, Western blotting, and
immunohistochemistry, we characterized MCP expression in the testes and sperm of 
two New World monkeys. In these species, sperm express MCP bearing CCP1. The germ
cell-specific expression pattern of this domain strongly suggests an
evolutionarily conserved role for MCP in fertilization.

PURPOSE: The purpose of the investigation was to examine growth of the mandible
after costochondral grafting with special reference to the amount of cartilage
included in the grafts.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The material consisted of 5 growing and 3 adult marmoset
monkeys, Callithrix jacchus, in which the condylar process was removed
unilaterally and replaced with a costochondral graft (CCG) containing either a
short or long cartilage end. Growing animals were followed for 15 months until
they attained maturity; and adult animals were followed for 13 months.
Measurements made on frontal radiographs performed bimonthly, and direct
measurements made on dry mandibles and crania at the end of the experiment, were 
used to evaluate the growth of the mandible and glenoid fossa.
RESULTS: Longitudinal cephalometric evaluation revealed a gradual deviation of
the lower dental midline to the unoperated side in growing monkeys with a long
cartilage transplant. In all other animals, virtually no midline deviation
occurred. Measurements on dry mandibles showed that the length and ramus height
were longer in growing animals with long cartilage transplants compared with
those with short cartilage transplants. In adult animals, the amount of cartilage
did not make any difference with regard to the mandibular measurements.
Enlargement of the articulating head on the grafted side was recorded in all
animals. A morphologic change in the glenoid fossa of growing monkeys with a long
cartilage transplant was also noted.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this investigation indicate that depending on the
amount of cartilage in a unilateral CCG, a tissue-separating force is generated
in growing monkeys, capable of propelling the mandible to the unoperated side.
This gradual overgrowth occurs during the entire growth period, indicating a
strong hormonal and growth factor influence on the growth process. Jaw function
may have an effect on the articulating surface of the CCG, seen as enlarged
articulating head on the grafted side in all animals.

The mGlu2/3 antagonist LY-341,495 reverses the anti-dyskinetic and anti-psychotic
effects of the mGlu2 activators LY-487,379 and LY-354,740 in the MPTP-lesioned
marmoset.

We have recently shown that activation of metabotropic glutamate 2 (mGlu2)
receptors through positive allosteric modulation and orthosteric stimulation is a
novel approach to reduce L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA)-induced dyskinesia
and dopaminergic psychosis in Parkinson's disease (PD). We have obtained these
benefits with the mGlu2-positive allosteric modulator (PAM) LY-487,379 and the
mGlu2/3 orthosteric agonist (OA) LY-354,740 in experiments conducted in the
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-lesioned marmoset. Here, we
sought to pharmacologically characterise the anti-dyskinetic and anti-psychotic
effects of LY-487,379 and LY-354,740, by assessing whether their benefits would
be reversed by the mGlu2/3 orthosteric antagonist LY-341,495. Six MPTP-lesioned
marmosets exhibiting stable dyskinesia and psychosis-like behaviours (PLBs)
entered the experiments. In the first series of experiments, animals were
injected L-DOPA in combination with either vehicle, LY-487,379 (10 mg/kg),
LY-341,495 (1 mg/kg) or LY-487,379/LY-341,495. In the second series of
experiments, marmosets were injected L-DOPA in combination with either vehicle,
LY-354,740 (1 mg/kg), LY-341,495 (1 mg/kg) or LY-354,740/LY-341495. As we
previously demonstrated, both LY-487,379 and LY-354,740 alleviated dyskinesia (by
44% and 47%, both P < 0.001) and PLBs (by 44% and 39%, P < 0.01 and P < 0.001)
when compared to vehicle treatment. When LY-487,379 and LY-354,740 were
administered concurrently with LY-341,495, the anti-dyskinetic and anti-psychotic
benefits were abolished. When administered with L-DOPA in the absence of
LY-487,379 and LY-354,740, LY-341,495 did not worsen dyskinesia or PLBs and did
not hamper L-DOPA anti-parkinsonian action. Our results indicate that the
anti-dyskinetic and anti-psychotic effects of mGlu2-positive allosteric
modulation and mGlu2/3 orthosteric stimulation are reversed by mGlu2/3
orthosteric blockade.

Callimico goeldii gives birth to single offspring, whereas other callitrichids,
including Callithrix jacchus, twin. This study compares maternal effort and
infant development in C. goeldii and C. jacchus; it is the first study to look at
nursing frequency. Infants were observed from birth for 7 weeks in two captive
groups each of C. goeldii and C. jacchus. C. goeldii mothers physiologically
invested the same or less than C. jacchus mothers. C. goeldii mothers gained the 
same amount of weight during pregnancy in absolute terms as did the smaller C.
jacchus. This results in a smaller gain in proportion to maternal weight but an
equivalent proportional gain on a per fetus basis. C. goeldii mothers nursed
their infants less based on duration of nursing bouts compared with C. jacchus
mothers. C. goeldii mothers transported their infants exclusively through the
first 2 weeks of life, which is longer than C. jacchus mothers, who exclusively
transported infants only during the first week of life. As maternal infant
carriage declined, other group members transported offspring in both species. C. 
goeldii infants engaged in independent locomotive sequences later in development 
and tasted solid foods less frequently than C. jacchus infants when compared at
equivalent ages. A single, opportunistic milk sample obtained from a C. goeldii
mother when her infant was 48 days old indicates that C. goeldii milk contains
gross energy from crude protein within the range of variation observed in
Callithrix milk. Despite the similarities in milk quality and prenatal effort in 
individual fetuses, C. goeldii infants gain weight faster from 0 to 18 months
than do C. jacchus infants. A reduction in litter size allows C. goeldii mothers 
to spend more time carrying their infant and to delay weaning, thereby allowing
accelerated infant and juvenile growth rates compared with C. jacchus.

OBJECTIVE: Mumps virus is isolated in Vero cells and, recently, B95a cells have
been reported to be susceptible to it. Currently circulating wild-type mumps
virus strains (genotypes B, G, J and L) induced cytopathic effects in both Vero
and B95a cells. On the other hand, the Hoshino vaccine strain (KO3) did not
induce cytopathic effects in B95a cells. In this study, differences in fusion
inducibility were investigated.
METHODS: Nucleotide sequences of the fusion (F) and hemagglutinin-neuraminidase
(HN) protein regions were compared. The F and HN expression plasmids were
constructed and fusion analysis was conducted, using recombinant F expression
plasmids under the control of T7 RNA polymerase.
RESULTS: Extensive cell fusion was observed when B95a cells were transfected with
the wild-type F expression plasmid as the F expression partner; 13-16 amino acid 
differences were observed in the F protein region between the KO3 and the wild
types. F expression plasmids with leucine at position 383 of the F protein
induced large cell fusion in B95a cells.
CONCLUSION: Leucine at position 383 of the F protein of the wild types was the
critical amino acid for fusion inducibility in B95a cells.

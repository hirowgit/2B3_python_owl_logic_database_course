BACKGROUND: Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in the common
marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus) is a relevant preclinical model for
translational research into immunopathogenic mechanisms operating in multiple
sclerosis (MS). Prior studies showed a core pathogenic role of T and B cells
specific for myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG). However, in those
studies, the quality of the response against MOG epitopes was strongly biased by 
bacterial antigens in the complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA), in which the
immunizing recombinant human (rh) MOG protein had been formulated. In response to
the need of a more refined EAE model, we have tested whether disease could also
be induced with rhMOG in incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA).
METHOD: Marmosets were immunized with rhMOG emulsified in IFA in the dorsal skin.
Monkeys that did not develop neurological deficit were given booster
immunizations at 28-day interval with the same antigen preparation. In a second
experiment, three marmoset twin pairs were sensitized against MOG peptides in IFA
to study a possibility for suppressive activity towards pathogenic T cells
directed against the encephalitogenic epitope MOG40-48.
RESULTS: Despite the absence of strong danger signals in the rhMOG/IFA inoculum, 
all monkeys developed clinically evident EAE symptoms. Moreover, in all monkeys, 
demyelinated lesions were present in the white matter and in two cases also in
the cortical grey matter. Immune profiling at height of the disease showed a
dominant T cell response against the overlapping peptides 14-36 and 24-46, but
reactivity against the pathogenically most relevant peptide 34-56 was
conspicuously absent. In the second experiment, there was an indication for a
possible suppressive mechanism.
CONCLUSIONS: Immunization of marmoset monkeys with rhMOG in IFA elicits clinical 
EAE in all animals. Moreover, rhMOG contains pathogenic and regulatory epitopes, 
but the pathogenic hierarchy of rhMOG epitopes is strongly influenced by the
adjuvant in which the protein is formulated.

The common marmoset has been increasingly used for research in the biomedical
field; however, there is little information available regarding effective methods
of anesthesia in this species. This study retrospectively analyzed 2 regimens of 
anesthesia induction: intramuscular injection of ketamine followed by inhalation 
of 5% sevoflurane, and intramuscular injection of midazolam, butorphanol and
ketamine followed by inhalation of 5% sevoflurane. Anesthetic depth did not reach
the surgical anesthesia stage in 7 out of 99 animals receiving the former
regimen, whereas there were only 2 such animals out of 273 receiving the latter
regimen. The latter regimen, when followed by maintenance anesthesia with 3%
sevoflurane inhalation, was successfully used in various nociceptive procedures. 
These results indicate that the injection of a combination of midazolam,
butorphanol and ketamine followed by inhalation of a high concentration of
sevoflurane is effective for anesthesia induction in marmosets.

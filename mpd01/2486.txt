Social foraging is suggested to increase foraging efficiency, as individuals
might benefit from public information acquired by monitoring the foraging
activities of other group members. We conducted a series experiments with captive
common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) to investigate to what extent marmosets
utilize social information about food location when foraging simultaneously with 
conspecifics. Subjects were confronted with dominant and subordinate
demonstrators in three experiments which differed in the amount of information
about food location available to the demonstrators. In all three experiments, the
focal subjects' performance in the social condition was not enhanced in
comparison to a non-social control condition. Because we could rule out
kleptoparasitism and aggressive displacements as explanations, we argue that the 
subjects' tendency for scramble competition by avoiding others and dispersing
over the foraging area seems to inhibit or mask the acquisition of social
information about the location of rewarded patches.

Fifty common marmoset pregnancies were monitored using ultrasound. The objective 
was to ascertain if fetal mortality was related to litter size. Prior to analysis
we determined abortion rate and litter size were not influenced by repeated
ultrasound. Mortality was unrelated to litter size and occurred fairly late in
gestation. All singletons born in this study began gestation as twins. It is
hypothesized that marmosets may be able to adjust litter size late in pregnancy
in response to proximate environmental factors.

Of 1,106 New World primates necropsied from the National Zoological Park
(Washington, D.C.) and the Department of Comparative Pathology, Johns Hopkins
University School of Medicine (Baltimore, Maryland) 22 (1.9%) animals were
identified with 27 neoplasms. Of this group, nine animals (two females, seven
males) had a total of 13 endocrine neoplasms. All animals were adults, with an
age range of 2.7-25 years (average, 12.1 years). Seven were Callitrichidae and
two were Cebidae. The adrenal gland was the most affected organ, with seven
(53.8%) neoplasms, followed by the pituitary and thyroid gland with two (15.4%)
cases each, and the pancreas and parathyroid gland with one tumor (7.7%) each.
All neoplastic disorders were benign. Immunocytochemistry assays for growth
hormone, adrenocorticotropic hormone, prolactin, follicle-stimulating hormone,
luteinizing hormone, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and chromogranin A were
performed on two pituitary neoplasms. Pheochromocytoma was the most frequent
neoplasm, representing 5 (38.4%) of the 13 neoplasms. The remaining were thyroid 
cystadenoma (two, 15.4%), corticotrophic cell pituitary adenoma (two, 15.4%),
adrenal ganglioneuroma (one, 7.7%), adrenal cortical adenoma (one, 7.7%),
parathyroid chief-cell adenoma (one, 7.7%), and pancreatic islet-cell adenoma
(one, 7.7%).

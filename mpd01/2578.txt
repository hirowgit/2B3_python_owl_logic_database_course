Human specific AluY elements were investigated by comparative analysis between
human chromosome 21 and chimpanzee chromosome 22. Human specific AluY element was
identified on human chromosome 21q22 (accession no. AL163282), and then that was 
a new member of AluYj subfamily. From the bioinformatic analysis, AluYj subfamily
was investigated in human whole genome using AluYj4 consensus sequence (accession
no. AL163282). Thirteen members of the AluYj4 elements (4 diagnostic mutations)
and eight members of the AluYj3 elements (3 diagnostic mutations) were identified
with distinct diagnostic mutation from AluY consensus sequence. The results of
the molecular clock calculation of non-CpG region substitution indicated that,
AluYj4 elements (2.1 million years old) may be proliferated more recent time than
AluYj3 elements (14.1 million years old). For the verification of recent
insertion time, four of AluYj4 elements (ch2-AC017101, ch10-AC044786,
ch12-AC007656 and ch21-AL163282) from human chromosomes 2, 10, 12, 21 were
analyzed by PCR amplification using various human and primate DNA samples.
Though, no polymorphism was detected in human population, we identified the new
AluYj4 subfamily as the human specific elements.

BACKGROUND: Female marmosets offer a promising primate model of stress-related
hypocortisolism, as they undergo chronic reductions in circulating cortisol after
becoming subordinate in a social group. In this study, we treated dominant and
subordinate female marmosets with the cortisol synthesis inhibitor metyrapone and
corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) to characterize the effects of subordination
on central regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis.
METHODS: Seven dominant and six subordinate female marmosets received CRF (6
microg/kg, intravenous [IV]), following pretreatment with metyrapone (75 mg/kg,
by mouth [PO]) or water. Plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol
concentrations were determined before metyrapone or water treatment and before, 1
hour after, and 2 hours after CRF treatment.
RESULTS: Following metyrapone treatment, subordinates had similar cortisol levels
to dominants but significantly higher ACTH levels. During CRF challenges,
cortisol concentrations were lower and ACTH concentrations higher in
subordinates, although net integrated responses to CRF did not differ.
Cortisol-to-ACTH ratios were consistently lower in subordinates.
CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm previous findings of low cortisol
concentrations and blunted adrenal responsiveness in subordinates and suggest
that when differences in cortisol levels are eliminated, subordinates exhibit
exaggerated hypothalamic drive to the pituitary. These neuroendocrine alterations
in subordinate marmosets resemble those in posttraumatic stress disorder patients
and adult survivors of child abuse.

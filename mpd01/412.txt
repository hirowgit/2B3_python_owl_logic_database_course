The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a non-human primate that provides
valuable models for neuroscience and aging research due to its anatomical
similarities to humans and relatively short lifespan. This study was carried out 
to examine whether aged marmosets develop glaucoma, as seen in humans. We found
that 11% of the aged marmosets presented with glaucoma-like characteristics; this
incident rate is very similar to that in humans. Magnetic resonance imaging
showed a significant volume loss in the visual cortex, and histological analyses 
confirmed the degeneration of the lateral geniculate nuclei and visual cortex in 
the affected marmosets. These marmosets did not have elevated intraocular
pressure, but showed an increased oxidative stress level, low cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF) pressure, and low brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and TrkB
expression in the retina, optic nerve head and CSF. Our findings suggest that
marmosets have potential to provide useful information for the research of eye
and the visual system.

Gummivory poses unique challenges to the dentition as gum acquisition may often
require that the anterior teeth be adapted to retain a sharp edge and to resist
loading because they sometimes must penetrate a highly obdurate substrate during 
gum extraction by means of gouging or scraping. It has been observed previously
that the enamel on the labial surface of the teeth used for extraction is thicker
relative to that on the lingual surface in taxa that extract gums, while enamel
is more evenly distributed in the anterior teeth of taxa that do not regularly
engage in extractive behaviors. This study presents a quantitative methodology
for measuring the distribution of labial versus lingual enamel thickness among
primate and marsupial taxa in the context of gummivory. Computed microtomography 
scans of 15 specimens representing 14 taxa were analyzed. Ten measurements were
taken at 20% intervals starting from the base of the crown of the extractive
tooth to the tip of the cutting edge across the lingual and labial enamel. A
method for including worn or broken teeth is also presented. Mann-Whitney U
tests, canonical variates analysis, and between-group principal components
analysis were used to examine variation in enamel thickness across taxa. Our
results suggest that the differential distribution of enamel thickness in the
anterior dentition can serve as a signal for gouging behavior; this methodology
distinguishes between gougers, scrapers, and nonextractive gummivores. Gouging
taxa are characterized by significantly thicker labial enamel relative to the
lingual enamel, particularly towards the crown tip. Examination of enamel
thickness patterning in these taxa permits a better understanding of the
adaptations for the extraction of gums in extant taxa and offers the potential to
test hypotheses concerning the dietary adaptations of fossil taxa.

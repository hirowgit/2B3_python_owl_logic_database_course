Cortical demyelination is a widely recognized hallmark of multiple sclerosis (MS)
and correlate of disease progression and cognitive decline. The pathomechanisms
initiating and driving gray matter damage are only incompletely understood. Here,
we determined the infiltrating leukocyte subpopulations in 26 cortical
demyelinated lesions of biopsied MS patients and assessed their contribution to
cortical lesion formation in a newly developed mouse model. We find that
conformation-specific anti-myelin antibodies contribute to cortical demyelination
even in the absence of the classical complement pathway. T cells and natural
killer cells are relevant for intracortical type 2 but dispensable for subpial
type 3 lesions, whereas CCR2+ monocytes are required for both. Depleting CCR2+
monocytes in marmoset monkeys with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis
using a novel humanized CCR2 targeting antibody translates into significantly
less cortical demyelination and disease severity. We conclude that biologics
depleting CCR2+ monocytes might be attractive candidates for preventing cortical 
lesion formation and ameliorating disease progression in MS.

The middle-temporal area (MT) of primate visual cortex is critical in the
analysis of visual motion. Single-unit studies suggest that the response dynamics
of neurons within area MT depend on stimulus features, but how these dynamics
emerge at the population level, and how feature representations interact, is not 
clear. Here, we used multivariate classification analysis to study how stimulus
features are represented in the spiking activity of populations of neurons in
area MT of marmoset monkey. Using representational similarity analysis we
distinguished the emerging representations of moving grating and dot field
stimuli. We show that representations of stimulus orientation, spatial frequency,
and speed are evident near the onset of the population response, while the
representation of stimulus direction is slower to emerge and sustained throughout
the stimulus-evoked response. We further found a spatiotemporal asymmetry in the 
emergence of direction representations. Representations for high spatial
frequencies and low temporal frequencies are initially orientation dependent,
while those for high temporal frequencies and low spatial frequencies are more
sensitive to motion direction. Our analyses reveal a complex interplay of feature
representations in area MT population response that may explain the
stimulus-dependent dynamics of motion vision.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Simultaneous
multielectrode recordings can measure population-level codes that previously were
only inferred from single-electrode recordings. However, many multielectrode
recordings are analyzed using univariate single-electrode analysis approaches,
which fail to fully utilize the population-level information. Here, we overcome
these limitations by applying multivariate pattern classification analysis and
representational similarity analysis to large-scale recordings from
middle-temporal area (MT) in marmoset monkeys. Our analyses reveal a dynamic
interplay of feature representations in area MT population response.

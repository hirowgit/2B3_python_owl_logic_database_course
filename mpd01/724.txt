The vocal behavior of infants changes dramatically during early life. Whether or 
not such a change results from the growth of the body during development-as
opposed to solely neural changes-has rarely been investigated. In this study of
vocal development in marmoset monkeys, we tested the putative causal relationship
between bodily growth and vocal development. During the first two months of life,
the spontaneous vocalizations of marmosets undergo (1) a gradual disappearance of
context-inappropriate call types and (2) an elongation in the duration of
context-appropriate contact calls. We hypothesized that both changes are the
natural consequences of lung growth and do not require any changes at the neural 
level. To test this idea, we first present a central pattern generator model of
marmoset vocal production to demonstrate that lung growth can affect the temporal
and oscillatory dynamics of neural circuits via sensory feedback from the lungs. 
Lung growth qualitatively shifted vocal behavior in the direction observed in
real marmoset monkey vocal development. We then empirically tested this
hypothesis by placing the marmoset infants in a helium-oxygen (heliox)
environment in which air is much lighter. This simulated a reversal in
development by decreasing the effort required to respire, thus increasing the
respiration rate (as though the lungs were smaller). The heliox manipulation
increased the proportions of inappropriate call types and decreased the duration 
of contact calls, consistent with a brief reversal of vocal development. These
results suggest that bodily growth alone can play a major role in shaping the
development of vocal behavior.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) represents a promising nonhuman primate 
model for the study of human diseases because of its small size, ease of
handling, and availability of gene-modified animals. Here, we aimed to devise
reproductive technology for marmoset spermatid injection using immature males for
a possible rapid generational turnover. Spermatids at each step could be
identified easily by their morphology under differential interference microscopy:
thus, early round spermatids had a round nucleus with a few nucleolus-like
structures and abundant cytoplasm, as in other mammals. The spermatids acquired
oocyte-activating capacity at the late round spermatid stage, as confirmed by the
resumption of meiosis and Ca2+ oscillations upon injection into mouse oocytes.
The spermatids could be cryopreserved efficiently with a simple medium containing
glycerol and CELL BANKER®. Late round or elongated spermatids first appeared at
10-12 months of age, 6-8 months before sexual maturation. Marmoset oocytes
microinjected with frozen-thawed late round or elongated spermatids retrieved
from a 12-month-old male marmoset developed to the 8-cell stage without the need 
for artificial oocyte activation stimulation. Thus, it might be possible to
shorten the intergeneration time by spermatid injection, from 2 years (by natural
mating) to 13-15 months including gestation.

BACKGROUND: Galactocerebroside, the major glycolipid of central nervous system
myelin, is a known target for pathogenic demyelinating antibody responses in
experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), the animal model of multiple
sclerosis (MS).
OBJECTIVE: To address the importance of anti-galactocerebroside (alpha-GalC)
antibodies in MS and to evaluate them as biomarkers of disease.
METHODS: alpha-GalC IgGs were quantified from sera of patients with MS and in
marmoset EAE by a new immunosorbent assay.
RESULTS: We report a significant difference in serum alpha-GalC IgG titers
between patients with relapsing-remitting (RR)-MS and healthy controls (HCs; P < 
.001). The frequencies of alpha-GalC antibody-positive subjects (alpha-GalC
titers > or = mean HC titers+3 SD) are also significantly elevated in RR-MS
compared with HC (40% vs 0%; P = .0033). Immunoaffinity purified alpha-GalC IgGs 
from human serum bind to cultured human oligodendrocytes, indicating that the
ELISA detects a biologically relevant epitope. Corroborating these findings,
alpha-GalC antibody responses in marmoset EAE were similarly found to be
specifically associated with the RR forms and not the peracute or progressive
forms, in contrast with other anti-myelin antibodies (P = .0256).
CONCLUSION: (1) alpha-GalC antibodies appear MS-specific and are not found in
healthy subjects, unlike antibodies against myelin proteins; (2) when present,
alpha-GalC antibodies identify mostly RR-MS and may be an indicator of ongoing
disease activity. This novel assay is a suitable and valuable method to increase 
accuracy of diagnosis and disease staging in MS.

GBV-B, a member of the Flaviviridae family of viruses, is the virus most closely 
related to HCV, and GBV-B infection in tamarin monkeys might represent a valuable
surrogate animal model of HCV infection. In the current study, GBV-B was
successfully transmitted to two marmosets (Callithrix jaccus). The infection
resulted in viremia of 14- and 17-week duration, respectively, and was
accompanied by elevation of isocitrate dehydrogenase activity. These data confirm
that marmosets might represent an attractive model for GBV-B infection. The
sequence of GBV-B NS5A, which was previously reported to have one of the highest 
mutation rates during infection in tamarins, was determined for viruses recovered
from the inoculum and from marmoset blood samples obtained at weeks 1, 8, and 14 
post inoculation in one marmoset and at weeks 2, 8, and 17 post inoculation in
the other marmoset. In both animals, we detected four substitutions (R1945K,
K2052G, F2196L, and G2268E), in the virus recovered immediately before viral
clearance. Interestingly, two of these mutations (F2196L and G2268E) were
described recently for viruses recovered from persistently infected tamarins.
Appearance of these mutations presumably reflects a mechanism of immune escape
rather than adaptation of the virus to a new host.

The sexual behaviour of 16, oestradiol-treated, ovariectomized common marmosets
was recorded before and after bilateral microinfusions of ibotenic acid (n = 8)
or isotonic saline (n = 8) into the hypothalamus. Ibotenic acid-induced neuronal 
degeneration occurred in 5 females, mainly affecting the anterior and dorsomedial
hypothalamus. Marked decreases in proceptivity (tongue-flicking, staring and
immobile displays) occurred after ibotenic acid lesions, whereas sexual
receptivity (refusals and terminations of male partners' mounts) was unchanged.
In 3 females where microinfusions of ibotenic acid were attempted but failed to
produce lesions, sexual behaviour was unaffected and resembled that measured in
saline-treated controls. These results provide the first evidence that selective 
lesions of neuronal cell bodies in the anteromedial hypothalamus disrupt
proceptivity whilst sparing sexual receptivity in a primate species.

The use of home-based image sensors for biological and environmental monitoring
provides novel insight into health and development but it is difficult to
evaluate people during their normal activities in their home. Therefore, we
developed a low-cost infrared (IR) technology-based motion, location, temperature
and thermal environment detection system that can be used non-invasively for
long-term studies in the home environment. We tested this technology along with
the associated analysis algorithm to visualize the effects of parental care and
thermal environment on developmental state change in a non-human primate model,
the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). To validate this system, we first
compared it to a manual analysis technique and we then assessed the development
of circadian rhythms in common marmosets from postnatal day 15-45. The
semi-automatically tracked biological indices of locomotion velocity (BV) and
body surface temperature (BT) and the potential psychological index of place
preference toward the door (BD), showed age-dependent shifts in circadian phase
patterns. Although environmental variables appeared to affect circadian rhythm
development, principal component analysis and signal superimposing imaging
methods revealed a novel phasic pattern of BD-BT correlation day/night switching 
in animals older than postnatal day 38 (approximately equivalent to one year of
age in humans). The origin of this switch was related to earlier development of
body temperature (BT) rhythms and alteration of psychological behavior rhythms
(BD) around earlier feeding times. We propose that this cost-effective, inclusive
sensing and analytic technique has value for understanding developmental care
conditions for which continual home non-invasive monitoring would be beneficial
and further suggest the potential to adapt this technique for use in humans.

The ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) is a key brain structure implicated in
mood and anxiety disorders, based primarily on evidence from correlational
neuroimaging studies. Composed of a number of brain regions with distinct
architecture and connectivity, dissecting its functional heterogeneity will
provide key insights into the symptomatology of these disorders. Focusing on area
14, lying on the medial and orbital surfaces of the gyrus rectus, this study
addresses a key question of causality. Do changes in area 14 activity induce
changes in threat- and reward-elicited responses within the nonhuman primate, the
common marmoset, similar to that seen in mood and anxiety disorders? Area 14
overactivation was found to induce heightened responsivity to uncertain,
low-imminence threat while blunting cardiovascular and behavioral anticipatory
arousal to high-value food reward. Conversely, inactivation enhanced the arousal 
to high-value reward cues while dampening the acquisition of cardiovascular and
behavioral responses to a Pavlovian threat cue. Basal cardiovascular activity,
including heart rate variability and sympathovagal balance, which are
dysfunctional in mood and anxiety disorders, are insensitive to alterations in
area 14 activity as is the extinction of conditioned threat responses. The
distinct pattern of dysregulation compared to neighboring region area 25
highlights the heterogeneity of function within vmPFC and reveals how the effects
of area 14 overactivation on positive and negative reactivity mirror symptoms of 
anhedonia and anxiety that are so often comorbid in mood disorders.

Phthalates are the most widely used plasticisers in the world and have been in
medical use since 1955. Di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) is present in many
industrial and domestic products, and is a common plasticiser used in blood bags 
and tubing sets. Concerns have been raised by environmental groups that DEHP
exposure may result in gender birth defects and the feminisation of boys although
there were no studies performed of intravenous exposure to DEHP on higher mammals
or humans which report similar effects. This article reports on the toxicology of
DEHP and considers concerns regarding its use in the context of transfusion
medicine. The benefits of using DEHP are evaluated and the use of alternative
plasticisers to DEHP is explored. The article reports on international and
European regulatory recommendations for DEHP use in transfusion medicine and
examines the impact of legislation on the medical devices and blood industries.
The article also reviews labelling considerations for blood components and offers
some guidance for blood establishments in respect of DEHP use.

We used fluorescent tracers to map the pattern of cortical afferents to frontal
area 10 in marmosets. Dense projections originated in several subdivisions of
orbitofrontal cortex, in the medial frontal cortex (particularly areas 14 and
32), and in the dorsolateral frontal cortex (particularly areas 8Ad and 9). Major
projections also stemmed, in variable proportions depending on location of the
injection site, from both the inferior and superior temporal sensory association 
areas, suggesting a degree of audiovisual convergence. Other temporal projections
included the superior temporal polysensory cortex, temporal pole, and parabelt
auditory cortex. Medial area 10 received additional projections from
retrosplenial, rostral calcarine, and parahippocampal areas, while lateral area
10 received small projections from the ventral somatosensory and premotor areas. 
There were no afferents from posterior parietal or occipital areas. Most frontal 
connections were balanced in terms of laminar origin, giving few indications of
an anatomical hierarchy. The pattern of frontopolar afferents suggests an
interface between high-order representations of the sensory world and internally 
generated states, including working memory, which may subserve ongoing evaluation
of the consequences of decisions as well as other cognitive functions. The
results also suggest the existence of functional differences between subregions
of area 10.

PURPOSE: of the research: To achieve male fertility preservation and restoration,
experimental strategies for in vitro germ cell differentiation are required. The 
effects of two different culture conditions on in vitro maintenance and
differentiation of non-human primate germ cells was studied. Three testes from
three 6-month-old marmosets were cultured using a gas-liquid interphase system
for 12 days. Testicular maturation in pre-culture control and samples cultured in
gonadotropin and serum supplemented and non-supplemented culture samples was
evaluated using Periodic Acid-Schiff (PAS) and immunohistochemical stainings.
PRINCIPLE RESULTS: Gonadotropins and serum-supplemented tissues demonstrate up to
meiotic differentiation (BOULE + Pachytene spermatocyte) and advanced
localization of germ cells (MAGEA4+). Moreover, complex (with gonadotropin and
marmoset monkey serum) conditions induced progression in somatic cell maturation 
with advanced seminiferous epithelial organization, maintenance of encapsulation 
of cultured fragments with peritubular-myoid cells, preservation of tubular
structural integrity and architecture.
MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: We report stimulation-dependent in vitro meiotic transition in
non-human primate testes. This model represents a novel ex vivo approach to
obtain crucial developmental progression.

Positron emission tomography (PET) allows biomolecular tracking but PET
monitoring of brain networks has been hampered by a lack of suitable reporters.
Here, we take advantage of bacterial dihydrofolate reductase, ecDHFR, and its
unique antagonist, TMP, to facilitate in vivo imaging in the brain. Peripheral
administration of radiofluorinated and fluorescent TMP analogs enabled PET and
intravital microscopy, respectively, of neuronal ecDHFR expression in mice. This 
technique can be used to the visualize neuronal circuit activity elicited by
chemogenetic manipulation in the mouse hippocampus. Notably, ecDHFR-PET allows
mapping of neuronal projections in non-human primate brains, demonstrating the
applicability of ecDHFR-based tracking technologies for network monitoring.
Finally, we demonstrate the utility of TMP analogs for PET studies of turnover
and self-assembly of proteins tagged with ecDHFR mutants. These results establish
opportunities for a broad spectrum of previously unattainable PET analyses of
mammalian brain circuits at the molecular level.

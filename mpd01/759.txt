The birth of fraternal twins is a characteristic frequently observed in
callitrichids. Cytogenetic studies have demonstrated hematopoietic chimerism in
marmosets with the occurrence of two cell lines 2n=46,XX/46,XY in females and
males co-twins, without phenotypic changes. Amplification by PCR have also been
used to verify the presence of the SRY gene in female chimaeras. Our aim was to
verify the occurrence of chimerism in Callithrix sp. individuals considered as
hybrids according to their intermediate phenotypes between C. jacchus and C.
penicillata. Blood samples from 37 Callithrix sp. individuals were collected.
Hematopoietic chimerism 2n=46,XX/46,XY was detected by cytogenetic analysis in
five individuals, three males and two females. A fragment of approximately 200bp 
of the SRY gene was amplified in seven females with normal external genitalia.
The percentage of 32% of chimeric individuals detected in the present study is
similar to that observed for pure specimens of Callithrix. These data suggests
that hybridization probably does not interfere with the occurrence of twin
gestation, nor of chimerism. Although cytogenetics is the main tool to identify
the two cell lineages present in cases of chimerism, the amplification of the SRY
gene by PCR has proved to be more efficient to identify the Y chromosome in cases
of chimeric female marmoset.

With the loss and fragmentation of tropical forests, the survival of primates
depends on their ability to adapt to human-introduced modifications in their
habitat. Marmosets are known for their ecological and behavioral plasticity and
have been registered in various agricultural landscapes. Our goal was to describe
the ecology of tufted-ear marmosets (Callithrix sp.) in a rubber/forest
landscape, monitoring their use of habitat and diet. We followed two groups using
radio telemetry and visual observations for nine months at the Michelin
plantation Ltd. in Bahia, Brazil. Both groups used mainly pioneer forest and
rubber with pioneer vegetation more than expected according to availability, even
though they explored all types of vegetation. Rubber monocultures act as
corridors for marmoset locomotion among more suitable habitats. Feeding,
gummivory and socialization were mainly performed in the pioneer forest (with or 
without rubber), in which most sleeping sites and food sources were found. Groups
of marmosets can incorporate agroforest matrixes to their area of use and
activity patterns. Maintenance of marmosets in fragmented landscapes might be
favored by their diet flexibility, with the use of resources such as gum and
fruit, including exotic plants. Although known for their ecological flexibility, 
marmosets do require certain resources to be present in native habitat to adapt
to agricultural landscapes. Patches of forest within a rubber landscape and
pioneer vegetation in the rubber inter-rows should be considered to maintain
populations of Callithrix in rubber landscapes.

Nonhuman primates (NHPs) have been widely used in reproductive biology,
neuroscience, and drug development since a number of primate species are
phylogenetically close to humans. In this review, we summarize the use of NHPs
for nonclinical application in the reproductive system disorders including the
loss or failure of an organ or tissue. Causes of infertility include congenital
aplasia and acquired disorders of the reproductive organs. In addition,
anti-cancer treatments can deplete ovarian follicles, leading to premature
ovarian failure, infertility and long-term health risks. Along with a limited
supply of human reproductive organs, anatomic/physiologic similarities to humans 
support the need for NHP models (New-World monkeys such as the common marmoset
and Old-World monkeys such as cynomolgus and rhesus monkeys) to promote the
advances in female infertility studies. For maintaining and executing animal
studies using NHP, special protocols including animal care, anesthetic protocol, 
surgical technique, and immunosuppressive protocol are necessary. With a growing 
interest in the potential therapies such as endometrial tissue engineering, and
ovary/follicle cryopreservation and grafting in Korea, this review can be useful 
in selecting appropriate animal models and can bridge between nonclinical studies
and clinical applications by providing detailed information on the use of NHPs in
the field of reproductive organ disorders.

For nearly a century it has been observed that some residual visually guided
behavior can persist after damage to the primary visual cortex (V1) in primates. 
The age at which damage to V1 occurs leads to different outcomes, with V1 lesions
in infancy allowing better preservation of visual faculties in comparison with
those incurred in adulthood. While adult V1 lesions may still allow retention of 
some limited visual abilities, these are subconscious-a characteristic that has
led to this form of residual vision being referred to as blindsight. The neural
basis of blindsight has been of great interest to the neuroscience community,
with particular focus on understanding the contributions of the different
subcortical pathways and cortical areas that may underlie this phenomenon. More
recently, research has started to address which forms of neural plasticity occur 
following V1 lesions at different ages, including work using marmoset monkeys.
The relatively rapid postnatal development of this species, allied to the
lissencephalic brains and well-characterized visual cortex provide significant
technical advantages, which allow controlled experiments exploring visual
function in the absence of V1. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Develop Neurobiol

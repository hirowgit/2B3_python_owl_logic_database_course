Ureaplasmas in the marmoset (Callithrix jacchus): transmission and elimination.

Furr PM, Hetherington CM, Taylor-Robinson D.

All adult marmosets tested had ureaplasmas in their throats but not in the lower 
respiratory tract, and rarely in the genital tract. Ureaplasmas persisted in the 
throat of a marmoset separated from the colony for 44 days. They could not be
recovered from the animals for at least nine weeks after a course of minocycline.
Airborne reinfection did not occur when these animals were surrounded by, but
separate from, infected marmosets. It occurred when the minocycline-treated
animals were caged with the infected marmosets or were inoculated. The genital
tract was more difficult to infect than the oropharynx.

Anomalous origin of the right subclavian artery in a marmoset (Callithrix
jacchus).

Martin JE, Gerrity LW, Stein FJ.

Anomalous right subclavian artery in a one-day-old marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) 
is reported. The anomalous vessel originated with the left subclavian artery from
a short trunk off the arch of the aorta, then passed posterior to the esophagus, 
indenting it.

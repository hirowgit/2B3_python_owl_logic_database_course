BACKGROUND: This is the first study of the effect of epidermal growth factor
(EGF) on marmoset monkey oocytes matured in vitro.
METHODS: We have evaluated the effects of 10 ng/ml EGF in combination with 1 or
10 IU/ml of gonadotrophins (FSH/hCG 1:1 ratio) during in vitro maturation (IVM)
of marmoset oocytes. Immature cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) were retrieved from
ovarian antral follicles of unprimed monkeys. COCs from six animals (n= 268) used
in this study were randomly distributed among four experimental groups: (A) 1 FSH
+1 hCG; (B) 10 FSH +10 hCG; (C) 1 FSH +1 hCG + EGF; and (D) 10 FSH +10 hCG + EGF 
(where 1 and 10 are concentrations, IU/ml). After IVM, oocytes were fertilized in
vitro and embryos were allowed to progress up to 87-88 h.
RESULTS: the highest rate of total and radial cumulus expansion was observed in
Group A, with the lowest in Group B (P < 0.05). Neither maturation nor
fertilization rate were affected by gonadotrophin concentration or presence of
EGF. Addition of EGF increased degeneration and decreased first cleavage rate,
which was significantly lower in Group C than Group A (P < 0.005). Interestingly,
in the EGF groups some embryos cleaved faster than without EGF.
CONCLUSIONS: The effects of EGF are highly dependent on concentration of
gonadotrophins present in IVM medium. EGF has a negative effect on oocytes in the
presence of low gonadotrophins, but contrastingly partially protects oocytes from
the negative effects of high gonadotrophins. We propose that these observed
negative effects of EGF may suggest use of an inappropriate dose of growth
factor.

Brevity is not always a virtue in primate communication.

argued that the 'law of brevity' (an inverse relationship between word length and
frequency of use) applies not only to human language but also to vocal signalling
in non-human primates, because coding efficiency is paramount in both situations.
We analysed the frequency of use of signals of different duration in the vocal
repertoires of two Neotropical primate species studied in the wild-the common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) and the golden-backed uakari (Cacajao
melanocephalus). The key prediction of the law of brevity was not supported in
either species: although the most frequently emitted calls were relatively brief,
they were not the shortest signals in the repertoire. The costs and benefits
associated with signals of different duration must be appreciated to understand
properly their frequency of use. Although relatively brief vocal signals may be
favoured by natural selection in order to minimize energetic costs, the very
briefest signals may be ambiguous, contain reduced information or be difficult to
detect or locate, and may therefore be selected against. Analogies between human 
language and vocal communication in animals can be misleading as a basis for
understanding frequency of use, because coding efficiency is not the only factor 
of importance in animal communication, and the costs and benefits associated with
different signal durations will vary in a species-specific manner.

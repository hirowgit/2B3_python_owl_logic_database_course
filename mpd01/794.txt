Increasing evidence suggests that personality structure differs between species, 
but the evolutionary reasons for this variation are not fully understood. We
built on earlier research on New World monkeys to further elucidate the evolution
of personality structure in primates. We therefore examined personality in 100
family-reared adult common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) from 3 colonies on a
60-item questionnaire. Principal components analyses revealed 5 domains that were
largely similar to those found in a previous study on captive, ex-pet, or
formerly laboratory-housed marmosets that were housed in a sanctuary. The
interrater reliabilities of domain scores were consistent with the interrater
reliabilities of domain scores found in other species, including humans. Four
domainsdmdash;conscientiousness, agreeableness, inquisitiveness, and
assertiveness-resembled personality domains identified in other nonhuman
primates. The remaining domain, patience, was specific to common marmosets. We
used linear models to test for sex and age differences in the personality
domains. Males were lower than females in patience, and this difference was
smaller in older marmosets. Older marmosets were lower in inquisitiveness.
Finally, older males and younger females had higher scores in agreeableness than 
younger males and older females. These findings suggest that cooperative breeding
may have promoted the evolution of social cognition and influenced the structure 
of marmoset prosocial personality characteristics. (PsycINFO Database Record

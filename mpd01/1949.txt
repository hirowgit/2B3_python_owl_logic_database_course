BACKGROUND: This study investigated the effects of inhibition of vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) during the first postpartum cycle in marmosets
housed with a fertile male where a 90% fertility rate is normal.
METHODS: On resumption of mating, females were treated with either 25 mg/kg
aflibercept, a potent VEGF inhibitor, or control Fc protein (n=6 per group) at
the time of ovulation. Effects on timing of pregnancy were monitored by measuring
plasma progesterone, chorionic gonadotropin (CG) and uterine palpation.
RESULTS: In five of six Fc-treated controls, the postpartum rise in progesterone 
was maintained and followed by a sustained rise in CG by Day 30 posttreatment
indicating pregnancy. In all six aflibercept-treated animals, progesterone
secretion was suppressed in the treatment cycle and a CG rise did not occur by
Day 30. Pregnancy was delayed to the next cycle, significantly extending
interbirth interval compared to controls. Posttreatment deliveries and infant
development were normal.
CONCLUSION: These results show that stringent pharmacological inhibition of VEGF 
suppresses luteal progesterone and prevents the successful establishment of
pregnancy.

Color vision in mammals is based on the expression of at least two cone opsins
that are sensitive to different wavelengths of light. Furthermore, retinal
pathways conveying color-opponent signals are required for color discrimination. 
Most of the primates are trichromats, and "color-coded channels" of their retinas
are unveiled to a large extent. In contrast, knowledge of cone-selective pathways
in nonprimate dichromats is only slowly emerging, although retinas of dichromats 
like mice or rats are extensively studied as model systems for retinal
information processing. Here, we review recent progress of research on
color-coded pathways in nonprimate dichromats to identify differences or
similarities between di- and trichromatic mammals. In addition, we applied
immunohistochemical methods and confocal microscopy to retinas of different
species and present data on their neuronal properties, which are expected to
contribute to color vision. Basic neuronal features such as the "blue cone
bipolar cell" exist in every species investigated so far. Moreover, there is
increasing evidence for chromatic OFF channels in dichromats and retinal ganglion
cells that relay color-opponent signals to the brain. In conclusion, di- and
trichromats share similar retinal pathways for color transmission and processing.

Biomedical research involving animal models continues to provide important
insights into disease pathogenesis and treatment of diseases that impact human
health. In particular, nonhuman primates (NHPs) have been used extensively in
translational research due to their phylogenetic proximity to humans and
similarities to disease pathogenesis and treatment responses as assessed in
clinical trials. Microscopic changes in tissues remain a significant endpoint in 
studies involving these models. Spontaneous, expected (ie, incidental or
background) histopathologic changes are commonly encountered and influenced by
species, genetic variations, age, and geographical origin of animals, including
exposure to infectious or parasitic agents. Often, the background findings
confound study-related changes, because numbers of NHPs used in research are
limited by animal welfare and other considerations. Moreover, background findings
in NHPs can be exacerbated by experimental conditions such as treatment with
xenobiotics (eg, infectious morphological changes related to immunosuppressive
therapy). This review and summary of research-relevant conditions and pathology
in rhesus and cynomolgus macaques, baboons, African green monkeys, common
marmosets, tamarins, and squirrel and owl monkeys aims to improve the
interpretation and validity of NHP studies.

The mechanism of kidney injury in aging are not well understood. In order to
identify hitherto unknown pathways of aging-related kidney injury, we performed
RNA-Seq on kidney extracts of young and aged mice. Expression of chloride (Cl)
channel accessory 1 (CLCA1) mRNA and protein was increased in the kidneys of aged
mice. Immunostaining showed a marked increase in CLCLA1 expression in the
proximal tubules of the kidney from aged mice. Increased kidney CLCA1 gene
expression also correlated with aging in marmosets and in a human cohort. In
aging mice, increased renal cortical CLCA1 content was associated with hydrogen
sulfide (H2 S) deficiency, which was ameliorated by administering sodium
hydrosulfide (NaHS), a source of H2 S. In order to study whether increased CLCA1 
expression leads to injury phenotype and the mechanisms involved, stable
transfection of proximal tubule epithelial cells overexpressing human CLCA1
(hCLCA1) was performed. Overexpression of hCLCA1 augmented Cl- current via the
Ca++ -dependent Cl- channel TMEM16A (anoctamin-1) by patch-clamp studies. hCLCA1 
overexpression also increased the expression of fibronectin, a matrix protein,
and induced the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Mechanistic
studies underlying these changes showed that hCLCA1 overexpression leads to
inhibition of AMPK activity and stimulation of mTORC1 as cellular signaling
determinants of injury. Both TMEM16A inhibitor and NaHS reversed these signaling 
events and prevented changes in fibronectin and SASP. We conclude that
CLCA1-TMEM16A-Cl- current pathway is a novel mediator of kidney injury in aging
that is regulated by endogenous H2 S.

Neurons in the middle temporal (MT) area of primate cortex provide an important
stage in the analysis of visual motion. For simple stimuli such as bars and
plaids some neurons in area MT--pattern cells--seem to signal motion independent 
of contour orientation, but many neurons--component cells--do not. Why area MT
supports both types of receptive field is unclear. To address this we made
extracellular recordings from single units in area MT of anaesthetised marmoset
monkeys and examined responses to two-dimensional images with a large range of
orientations and spatial frequencies. Component and pattern cell response
remained distinct during presentation of these complex spatial textures.
Direction tuning curves were sharpest in component cells when a texture contained
a narrow range of orientations, but were similar across all neurons for textures 
containing all orientations. Response magnitude of pattern cells, but not
component cells, increased with the spatial bandwidth of the texture. In
addition, response variability in all neurons was reduced when the stimulus was
rich in spatial texture. Fisher information analysis showed that component cells 
provide more informative responses than pattern cells when a texture contains a
narrow range of orientations, but pattern cells had more informative responses
for broadband textures. Component cells and pattern cells may therefore coexist
because they provide complementary and parallel motion signals.

In order to directly demonstrate the roles of CD8(+) T lymphocytes in non-human
primates, in vivo depletion of the CD8(+) T cells by administration of a
CD8-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) is one of the crucial techniques.
Recently, the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), which is classified as a New 
World monkey, has been shown useful as an experimental animal model for various
human diseases such as multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease and a number of
infectious diseases. Here we show that an anti-marmoset CD8 mAb 6F10, which we
have recently established, efficiently depletes the marmoset CD8(+) T lymphocytes
in vivo, i.e., the administration of 6F10 induces drastic and specific reduction 
in the ratio of the CD8(+) T cell subset for at least three weeks or longer. Our 
finding will help understand the pivotal role of CD8(+) T cells in vivo in the
control of human diseases.

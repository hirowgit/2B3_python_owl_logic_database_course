The marmoset is an emerging animal model for large-scale attempts to understand
primate brain connectivity, but achieving this aim requires the development and
validation of procedures for normalization and integration of results from many
neuroanatomical experiments. Here we describe a computational pipeline for
coregistration of retrograde tracing data on connections of cortical areas into a
3D marmoset brain template, generated from Nissl-stained sections. The procedure 
results in a series of spatial transformations that are applied to the
coordinates of labeled neurons in the different cases, bringing them into common 
stereotaxic space. We applied this procedure to 17 injections, placed in the
frontal lobe of nine marmosets as part of earlier studies. Visualizations of
cortical patterns of connections revealed by these injections are supplied as
Supplementary Materials. Comparison between the results of the automated and
human-based processing of these cases reveals that the centers of injection sites
can be reconstructed, on average, to within 0.6 mm of coordinates estimated by an
experienced neuroanatomist. Moreover, cell counts obtained in different areas by 
the automated approach are highly correlated (r = 0.83) with those obtained by an
expert, who examined in detail histological sections for each individual. The
present procedure enables comparison and visualization of large datasets, which
in turn opens the way for integration and analysis of results from many animals. 
Its versatility, including applicability to archival materials, may reduce the
number of additional experiments required to produce the first detailed cortical 
connectome of a primate brain. J. Comp. Neurol. 524:2161-2181, 2016. © 2016 The

In situ hybridization analyses of claustrum-enriched genes in marmosets.

Watakabe A.

The claustrum/endopiriform nucleus is a unique structure that sits between the
striatum and the cerebral cortex. Recent genome-wide mapping of gene expression
in mice identified various genes concentrated in this structure, suggesting a
requirement for a special set of genes for its function. In situ hybridization
histochemistry was performed for such "claustrum-enriched" genes in the marmoset 
brain. In marmosets, nurr1 and netrinG2 genes exhibited highly concentrated
expression in the claustrum and endopiriform nucleus, as well as in a
subpopulation of layer 6 neurons across the entire cortex, consistent with their 
expression patterns as described in macaques. Cux2 showed enriched expression in 
the upper layers (layers 2-4) and the claustrum/endopiriform nucleus. GNG2 was
expressed strongly in the claustrum/endopiriform nucleus, but was abundant across
cortical areas in a ventral high-dorsal low gradient. Latexin was detected in the
claustrum and dorsal endopiriform nucleus, but not in cortical regions. GNB4 and 
Tmem163 genes were both concentrated in the claustrum/endopiriform nucleus, as
reported in mice, but their cortical expression in the marmoset differed from the
mouse pattern. Thus, the gene set required for the claustrum appears to be
broadly conserved across species, despite various differences that suggest
species-specific differentiation of brain architecture. J. Comp. Neurol.

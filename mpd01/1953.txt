BACKGROUND: Common marmoset monkeys (Callithrix jacchus) are readily used in
biomedical research. However, superovulation for embryonic stem cell production
and developmental research still remain difficult. Inexplicably,
follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) as key player in superovulation has to be
administered in extremely high dosages in this non-human primate compared to
human.
METHODS: To evaluate whether marmoset FSH (cjFSH) is functionally more competent 
than its human homologue on the marmoset FSH receptor (cjFSHR), we established in
vitro a homologous system characterizing homologous and recombinantly produced
cjFSH.
RESULTS: Upon stimulation of two cell lines stably expressing either the marmoset
or the human FSH receptor (cj/hFSHR), respectively, the second messenger
signaling of the activated receptor displayed no significant difference in ED(50)
values. Thermostability of cjFSH was significantly prolonged by roughly 20% on
both FSHRs.
CONCLUSION: High FSH dosage in marmoset superovulation cannot be explained by
enhanced biopotency of the natural animal's gonadotropin.

Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) are the most commonly used feeder cells for
pluripotent stem cells. However, autogeneic feeder (AF) cells have several
advantages such as no xenogeneic risks and reduced costs. In this report, we
demonstrate that common marmoset embryonic stem (cmES) cells can be maintained on
common marmoset AF (cmAF) cells. These cmES cells were maintained on cmAF cells
for 6 months, retaining their morphology, normal karyotype, and expression
patterns for the pluripotent markers Oct-3/4, Nanog, SSEA-3, SSEA-4, TRA-1-60,
and TRA-1-81, as well as their ability to differentiate into cardiac and neural
cells. Antibody array analysis revealed equivalent protein expression profiles
between cmES cells maintained on cmAF cells and MEFs. In addition, similarly
prepared human embryonic stem (hES) and induced pluripotent stem (hiPS)
cell-derived AF cells supported the growth of and maintained the morphology and
pluripotent marker expressions of hES and hiPS cells, respectively. DNA
microarray analysis revealed that these hES and hiPS cells had mRNA expression
profiles similar to those of hES and hiPS cells maintained on MEFs, respectively.
Taken together, these findings imply that AF cells can replace MEFs in the
routine maintenance of primate pluripotent stem cells.

The role by which the gut microbiome influences host health (e.g., energy
equilibrium and immune system) may be partly mediated by short-chain fatty acids,
which are bacterial fermentation products from the dietary fibers. However,
little is known about longitudinal changes in gut microbiome metabolites during
cohabitation alongside social contact. In common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus), 
the gut microbiome community is influenced by social contact, as newly paired
males and females develop convergent microbial profiles. Here, we monitored the
dynamics of short-chain fatty acid concentrations in common marmoset feces from
the prepairing (PRE) to postpairing (POST) stages. In males, we observed that the
concentrations of acetate, propionate, isobutyrate, and isovalerate significantly
increased in the POST stage compared to the PRE stage. However, no significant
changes were found in females. We further found that the propionate concentration
was significantly positively correlated with the abundance of
Phascolarctobacterium in the male feces. Thus, the sex difference in the changes 
in the concentrations of short-chain fatty acids might be related to sex-biased
gut microbiome transmission after pairing. We suggest that the significant
changes in the gut microbiomes and some short-chain fatty acids of the common
marmoset during cohabitation may contribute to physiological homeostasis during
pairing.IMPORTANCE This study addressed a knowledge gap about longitudinal
changes in the gut microbiome metabolites during animal pairing. This research in
the laboratory common marmoset can control for the confounding factors such as
diet and other environmental conditions. Phascolarctobacterium showed the highest
contribution to the sex-biased transmission of the female to the male after
pairing. Here, we observed the sex difference in the increase in short-chain
fatty acid concentration in the feces of newly paired marmosets, which may be
caused by the sex-biased gut microbiome transmission after pairing.

Altered olfactory function is a common symptom of COVID-19, but its etiology is
unknown. A key question is whether SARS-CoV-2 (CoV-2) - the causal agent in
COVID-19 - affects olfaction directly, by infecting olfactory sensory neurons or 
their targets in the olfactory bulb, or indirectly, through perturbation of
supporting cells. Here we identify cell types in the olfactory epithelium and
olfactory bulb that express SARS-CoV-2 cell entry molecules. Bulk sequencing
demonstrated that mouse, non-human primate and human olfactory mucosa expresses
two key genes involved in CoV-2 entry, ACE2 and TMPRSS2. However, single cell
sequencing revealed that ACE2 is expressed in support cells, stem cells, and
perivascular cells, rather than in neurons. Immunostaining confirmed these
results and revealed pervasive expression of ACE2 protein in dorsally-located
olfactory epithelial sustentacular cells and olfactory bulb pericytes in the
mouse. These findings suggest that CoV-2 infection of non-neuronal cell types
leads to anosmia and related disturbances in odor perception in COVID-19
patients.

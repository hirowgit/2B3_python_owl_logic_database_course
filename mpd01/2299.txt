A fundamental feature of auditory perception is the constancy of sound
recognition over a large range of intensities. Although this invariance has been 
described in behavioral studies, the underlying neural mechanism is essentially
unknown. Here we show a putative level-invariant representation of sounds by
populations of neurons in primary auditory cortex (A1) that may provide a neural 
basis for the behavioral observations. Previous studies reported that pure-tone
frequency tuning of most A1 neurons widens with increasing sound level. In sharp 
contrast, we found that a large proportion of neurons in A1 of awake marmosets
were narrowly and separably tuned to both frequency and sound level. Tuning
characteristics and firing rates of the neural population were preserved across
all tested sound levels. These response properties lead to a level-invariant
representation of sounds over the population of A1 neurons. Such a representation
is an important step for robust feature recognition in natural environments.

BACKGROUND: Serum protein analysis in both humans and experimental animal species
has so far been carried out by labor-intensive techniques, such as agarose gel
electrophoresis (AGE).
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate capillary electrophoresis 
(CE) as an alternative technique to AGE for the analysis of serum proteins from
healthy animals.
METHODS: Blood samples were collected into tubes without anticoagulant from 6
fasted healthy male mice, rats, dogs, marmosets, and humans. Serum proteins were 
separated by CE using a technique standardized for the analysis of human
proteins, and the results (efficiency, resolution, and precision) were compared
with those obtained through AGE.
RESULTS: Compared with AGE, CE resulted in narrower peaks and more peaks. The
efficiency of protein separation by CE was significantly higher for all species, 
and resolution (R) was significantly higher in samples from dogs. Using rat
serum, intraday reproducibility was lower for all protein fractions, and interday
reproducibility was lower for most peaks, compared with AGE.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that CE is a viable alternative to AGE for the
determination of protein electrophoresis in a routine veterinary clinical
pathology laboratory. The minimal sample requirement (2 microL), complete
automation, and quantitative results make CE an especially valuable technique for
protein analysis in experimental animal models.

α-Synuclein is a defining, key component of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites in
Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), as well as glial
cytoplasmic inclusions in multiple system atrophy (MSA). The distribution and
spreading of these pathologies are closely correlated with disease progression.
Recent studies have revealed that intracerebral injection of synthetic
α-synuclein fibrils or pathological α-synuclein prepared from DLB or MSA brains
into wild-type or transgenic animal brains induced prion-like propagation of
phosphorylated α-synuclein pathology. The common marmoset is a very small primate
that is expected to be a useful model of human diseases. Here, we show that
intracerebral injection of synthetic α-synuclein fibrils into adult wild-type
marmoset brains (caudate nucleus and/or putamen) resulted in spreading of
abundant α-synuclein pathologies, which were positive for various antibodies to
α-synuclein, including phospho Ser129-specific antibody, anti-ubiquitin and
anti-p62 antibodies, at three months after injection. Remarkably, robust Lewy
body-like inclusions were formed in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neurons in
these marmosets, strongly suggesting the retrograde spreading of abnormal
α-synuclein from striatum to substantia nigra. Moreover, a significant decrease
in the numbers of TH-positive neurons was observed in the injection-side of the
brain, where α-synuclein inclusions were deposited. Furthermore, most of the
α-synuclein inclusions were positive for 1-fluoro-2,5-bis
(3-carboxy-4-hydroxystyryl) benzene (FSB) and thioflavin-S, which are dyes widely
used to visualize the presence of amyloid. Thus, injection of synthetic
α-synuclein fibrils into brains of non-transgenic primates induced PD-like
α-synuclein pathologies within only 3 months after injection. Finally, we provide
evidence indicating that neurons with abnormal α-synuclein inclusions may be
cleared by microglial cells. This is the first marmoset model for α-synuclein
propagation. It should be helpful in studies to elucidate mechanisms of disease
progression and in development and evaluation of disease-modifying drugs for
α-synucleinopathies.

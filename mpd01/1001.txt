Age is the number one risk factor for breast cancer, yet the underlying
mechanisms are unexplored. Age-associated mammary stem cell (MaSC) dysfunction is
thought to play an important role in breast cancer carcinogenesis. Non-human
primates with their close phylogenetic relationship to humans provide a powerful 
model system to study the effects of aging on human MaSC. In particular, the
common marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus) with a relatively short life span is 
an ideal model for aging research. In the present study, we characterized for the
first time the mammary epithelial stem/progenitor cells in the common marmoset.
The MaSC-enriched cells formed four major types of morphologically distinct
colonies when cultured on plates pre-seeded with irradiated NIH3T3 fibroblasts,
and were also capable of forming mammospheres in suspension culture and
subsequent formation of 3D organoids in Matrigel culture. Most importantly, these
3D organoids were found to contain stem/progenitor cells that can undergo
self-renewal and multi-lineage differentiation both in vitro and in vivo. We also
observed a significant decrease of luminal-restricted progenitors with age. Our
findings demonstrate that common marmoset mammary stem/progenitor cells can be
isolated and quantified with established in vitro and in vivo assays used for
mouse and human studies.

At least one non-human primate species-the marmoset monkey-exhibits developmental
processes similar to human vocal development. These processes include
babbling-like early vocal output and a role for social feedback in changing this 
output into mature-sounding vocalizations. Such parallel behaviors provide a
window through which we can begin to understand the physiological mechanisms for 
how early vocalizations are produced and shaped by social feedback. The latest
work shows that the acoustic structure of babbling in infant monkeys is driven by
oscillations of the autonomic nervous system. It is hypothesized that this
autonomic nervous system rhythm is perturbed through vocal interactions between
infants and parents. These interactions gradually accelerate the transformation
of immature vocalizations into mature forms.

BACKGROUND: Vitamin D is a secosteroid hormone with important roles in the
control of bone and mineral metabolism of vertebrates and in the maintenance of
systemic homeostasis. This study aimed (i) to evaluate the serum concentrations
of 25-hydroxy-vitamin D levels [25(OH)D], parathyroid hormone (PTH) and ionized
calcium (iCa) of wild Callithrix penicillata (black-tufted marmosets) and (ii) to
propose reference ranges for those analytes for free-living marmosets.
METHODS: Blood samples were collected from 15 wild animals and analyzed for
25(OH)D, PTH and iCa. Reference values were calculated following standard
analytical criteria.
RESULTS: The observed mean serum levels (±standard deviation) were 25(OH)D, 61.7 
(±20.8) ng/ml; PTH, 275.2 (±34.1) pg/ml; iCai 4.0 (±0.6) mg/dl.
CONCLUSIONS: For free-living marmosets, the proposed physiological range for
25(OH)D is 20.1-103.3 ng/ml and for PTH is 207.0-343.3 pg/dl, with a confidence
interval of 95%.

BACKGROUND: Cocaine is a widely abused drug which can result in the establishment
of addiction. The neurokinin3-receptor (NK3-R) has been linked to cocaine
addiction by genetic, epigenetic, and pharmacological studies suggesting that a
cocaine-induced increase in NK3-R signaling may contribute to the establishment
of cocaine addiction-related behaviors.
METHODS: Here we measured cocaine-induced sensitization of vigilance- and
locomotor behaviors in marmoset monkeys (Callithrix penicillata) in an open
field.
RESULTS: We found a sensitization of vigilance-related, but not locomotor
behaviors after repeated cocaine (7mg/kg, i.p.) treatment. There was a
cross-sensitization for scan frequency, but not of glance frequency, both
vigilance-related behaviors, after repeated treatment with the NK3-R agonist
senktide (0.2mg/kg, i.p.) given for 7 days, after a cocaine challenge (5mg/kg,
i.p.).
CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that in marmoset monkeys, repeated cocaine
treatment leads to a sensitization of vigilance-related behaviors, which have a
prominent role in spontaneously expressed activities in this species, but not of 
locomotor activity. Repeated activation of NK3-Rs can mimic some of the
behavioral sensitization effect and may thus contribute to the establishment of
cocaine related behaviors.

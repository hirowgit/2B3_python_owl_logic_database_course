Tyrosinase is a copper-containing enzyme that regulates melanin biosynthesis and 
is encoded by the tyrosinase (TYR) gene. Previous studies demonstrated that
mutations in TYR could lead to oculocutaneous albinism type 1 (OCA1) owing to the
failure of melanin formation. Although a previous study found that albinism in
the rhesus monkey was derived from a mutation in TYR, the identification and
characterization of this gene in non-human primates has not been achieved thus
far. Thus, using the rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) and internal reverse
transcription PCR (RT-PCR) we identified the full-length sequence of TYR in the
crab-eating macaque, and two different transcript variants (TYR_1 and TYR_2).
While TYR_1 comprised five exons and its coding sequence was highly similar to
that of humans, TYR_2 comprised four exons and was generated by a
third-exon-skipping event. Interestingly, these two transcripts were also present
in the African green monkey (Old World monkey) and the common marmoset (New World
monkey). Deduced amino acid sequence analyses revealed that TYR_2 had a shorter
C-terminal region than TYR_1 owing to the exon-skipping event. Thus, the present 
study is the first to identify and characterize a full-length TYR gene in a
non-human primate, while the further validation of the third-exon-skipping in TYR
indicates that this event is well conserved in the primate lineage. Therefore,
this study provides useful and important information for the study of albinism
using non-human primate models.

The absence of pathological hallmarks of progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) in
commonly used rodent models of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE)
hinders the development of adequate treatments for progressive disease. Work
reviewed here shows that such hallmarks are present in the EAE model in marmoset 
monkeys (Callithrix jacchus). The minimal requirement for induction of
progressive MS pathology is immunization with a synthetic peptide representing
residues 34-56 from human myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) formulated
with a mineral oil [incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA)]. Pathological aspects
include demyelination of cortical gray matter with microglia activation,
oxidative stress, and redistribution of iron. When the peptide is formulated in
complete Freund's adjuvant, which contains mycobacteria that relay strong
activation signals to myeloid cells, oxidative damage pathways are strongly
boosted leading to more intensive pathology. The proven absence of immune
potentiating danger signals in the MOG34-56/IFA formulation implies that a narrow
population of antigen-experienced T cells present in the monkey's immune
repertoire is activated. This novel pathway involves the interplay of
lymphocryptovirus-infected B cells with MHC class Ib/Caja-E restricted CD8+ CD56+
cytotoxic T lymphocytes.

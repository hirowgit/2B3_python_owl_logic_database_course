An object that is looming toward a subject or receding away contains important
information for determining if this object is dangerous, beneficial or harmless. 
This information (motion, direction, identity, time-to-collision, size, velocity)
is analyzed by the brain in order to execute the appropriate behavioral responses
depending on the context: fleeing, freezing, grasping, eating, exploring. In the 
current study, we performed ultra-high-field functional MRI (fMRI) at 9.4T in
awake marmosets to explore the patterns of brain activation elicited by visual
stimuli looming toward or receding away from the monkey. We found that looming
and receding visual stimuli activated a large cortical network in frontal,
parietal, temporal and occipital cortex in areas involved in the analysis of
motion, shape, identity and features of the objects. Looming stimuli strongly
activated a network composed of portions of the pulvinar, superior colliculus,
putamen, parietal, prefrontal and temporal cortical areas. These activations
suggest the existence of a network that processes visual stimuli looming toward
peripersonal space to predict the consequence of these stimuli. Together with
previous studies in macaque monkeys, these findings indicate that this network is
preserved across Old and New World primates.

Campylobacter species are being increasingly isolated and associated with disease
in humans and animals. Here, we describe four draft genome sequences of
Campylobacter species from nonhuman primates. These include Campylobacter
troglodytis, isolated from wild chimpanzees, and two likely new Campylobacter
species isolated from a lemur, common marmoset, and cotton-top tamarin.

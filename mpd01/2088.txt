The attrition rate of new drugs for central nervous system diseases including
multiple sclerosis (MS) is very high. A widely recognized bottleneck in the
selection of promising central nervous system drug candidates from the
development pipeline is the lack of sufficiently predictive animal models. Here, 
we review how the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model in the
Neotropical primate "common marmoset" can help to bridge the gap between rodent
EAE models and MS. The EAE model in the marmoset closely resembles MS in the
clinical as well as pathological presentation and can be used for fundamental
research into immunopathogenic mechanisms and for therapy development. We discuss
recent insights arising from this model, both on novel therapeutics and
immunopathogenesis.

An important problem in the study of the mammalian visual system is whether
functionally different retinal ganglion cell types are anatomically segregated
further up along the central visual pathway. It was previously demonstrated that,
in a New World diurnal monkey (marmoset), the neurones carrying signals from the 
short-wavelength-sensitive (S) cones [blue-yellow (B/Y)-opponent cells] are
predominantly located in the koniocellular layers of the dorsal lateral
geniculate nucleus (LGN), whereas the red-green (R/G)-opponent cells carrying
signals from the medium- and long-wavelength-sensitive cones are segregated in
the parvocellular layers. Here, we used extracellular single-unit recordings
followed by histological reconstruction to investigate the distribution of
color-selective cells in the LGN of the macaque, an Old World diurnal monkey.
Cells were classified using cone-isolating stimuli to identify their cone inputs.
Our results indicate that the majority of cells carrying signals from S-cones are
located either in the koniocellular layers or in the 'koniocellular bridges' that
fully or partially span the parvocellular layers. By contrast, the R/G-opponent
cells are located in the parvocellular layers. We conclude that anatomical
segregation of B/Y- and R/G-opponent afferent signals for color vision is common 
to the LGNs of New World and Old World diurnal monkeys.

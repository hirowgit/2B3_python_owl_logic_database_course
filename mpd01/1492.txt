We used multielectrode arrays to measure the response of populations of neurons
in primate middle temporal area to the transparent motion of two superimposed dot
fields moving in different directions. The shape of the population response was
well predicted by the sum of the responses to the constituent fields. However,
the population response profile for transparent dot fields was similar to that
for coherent plaid motion and hence an unreliable cue to transparency. We then
used single-unit recording to characterize component and pattern cells from their
response to drifting plaids. Unlike for plaids, component cells responded to the 
average direction of superimposed dot fields, whereas pattern cells could signal 
the constituent motions. This observation provides support for a strong
prediction of the Simoncelli and Heeger (1998) model of motion analysis in area
middle temporal, and suggests that pattern cells have a special status in the
processing of superimposed dot fields.

Marmosets rendered parkinsonian with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine
(MPTP) and treated with L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) develop dyskinesia,
but with differing degrees of severity. To provide insight into the molecular
mechanisms responsible for the different level of dyskinesia to manifest in
individual animals, proteins in striatum from MPTP-treated marmosets with
different levels of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia were separated by 2-dimensional
(2-D) protein electrophoresis. Thirty-five differentially expressed proteins were
identified by mass spectrometry and peptide mass fingerprinting, and comparative 
analysis found 10 were significantly increased and 3 had significantly reduced
expression in animals with a high level of dyskinesia when compared to animals
with a low incidence of dyskinesia. These proteins belonged to a range of
functional classes, for example, molecular chaperones, metabolic enzymes and
synaptic structural proteins. The findings of this study provide clues about the 
molecular mechanisms that cause dyskinesia to manifest and point towards
potential novel targets for the development of therapeutic agents to prevent or
treat established dyskinesia.

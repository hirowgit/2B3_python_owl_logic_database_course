Genetic modification of non-human primates (NHP) paves the way for realistic
disease models. The common marmoset is a NHP species increasingly used in
biomedical research. Despite the invention of RNA-guided nucleases, one strategy 
for protein overexpression in NHP is still lentiviral transduction. We generated 
three male and one female enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-transgenic
founder marmosets via lentiviral transduction of natural preimplantation embryos.
All founders accomplished germline transmission of the transgene by natural
mating, yielding 20 transgenic offspring together (in total, 45 pups; 44%
transgenic). This demonstrates that the transgenic gametes are capable of natural
fertilization even when in competition with wildtype gametes. Importantly, 90% of
the transgenic offspring showed transgene silencing, which is in sharp contrast
to rodents, where the identical transgene facilitated robust EGFP expression.
Furthermore, we consistently discovered somatic, but so far, no germ cell
chimerism in mixed wildtype/transgenic litters. Somatic cell chimerism resulted
in false-positive genotyping of the respective wildtype littermates. For the
discrimination of transgenic from transgene-chimeric animals by polymerase chain 
reaction on skin samples, a chimeric cell depletion protocol was established. In 
summary, it is possible to establish a cohort of genetically modified marmosets
by natural mating, but specific requirements including careful promoter selection
are essential.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Overweight and obesity are undoubtable risk factors for
type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases and significantly contribute to the
global morbi-mortality. We previoulsy reported that LNP599, a pharmacological
imidazoline-like activator of hepatic AMPK/adiponectin signaling, protects
against the development of adiposity and obesity and the associated
cardio-metabolic disorders, suggesting that it may be a suitable drug candidate
for a therapeutic approach targeting the development of obesity at very early
stages. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the metabolic effects 
of LNP599 in a model of diet-induced overweight and metabolic disorders in a
nonhuman primate, the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), and more particularly
to establish the impact of the compound on cholesterol homeostasis, i.e., HDL and
LDL/VLDL lipoproteins.
METHODS: Marmosets were fed normal (NC) or hypercaloric (HC) chow during 16
weeks. Diet-induced changes in body weight and metabolism were assessed. Effects 
of LNP599 were evaluated in a subset of HC animals (HC-LNP) receiving the
compound at a daily dose of 10 mg/kg over the 16 weeks.
RESULTS: HC-feeding induced significant overweight associated with a marked
dyslipidemia (hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, and reduced HDL over
LDL/VLDL cholesterol ratio). LNP599 blunted the diet-induced body weight gain and
largely protected against the development of hypertriglyceridemia. Total
cholesterol was unchanged but the ratio of HDL over LDL/VLDL cholesterol was more
than doubled.
CONCLUSIONS: The profile of metabolic troubles obtained upon enriched diet
mimicked the disorders associated with spontaneous obesity in marmosets. HC
marmosets represent an experimental model of high clinical relevance to study the
pathophysiology of obesity and related dyslipidemia and to evaluate the effects
of emerging therapies targeting these disorders. Our data confirm the preventing 
effects of LNP599 in a nonhuman primate model and demonstrate for the first time 
the high potency of this drug in promoting HDL-cholesterol.

Cooperatively breeding common marmosets raise their infants with the help of
other adult group members, but individual care-taking contribution can vary
considerably. We tested four hypotheses that may explain this variation within
marmoset family groups. The pay-for-help hypothesis argues that allogrooming is
used strategically by parents to pay helpers for helping. The
pay-for-infant-access hypothesis claims that helpers use allogrooming as payment 
for infant-access. The intrinsic predisposition hypothesis suggests that more
affiliative individuals are also more motivated for infant-care, and the
relationship quality hypothesis that individuals involved in highly affiliative
relationships with main caregivers contribute more to infant-care. To test these 
hypotheses, we followed five marmoset family groups over a total of eight
reproductive cycles, and quantified affiliative behavior, infant-carrying, and
food sharing over six to 12 weeks around infant-birth. We found no evidence for
either the pay-for-help or pay-for-infant-access hypotheses nor did intrinsic
prosocial predisposition determine individual infant-care. Mutual dyadic
affiliation, however, was positively linked to infant-carrying and food sharing
in female and male breeders and in male helpers. This suggests that cooperation
during infant-care is mediated by relationship quality rather than strategic
grooming in marmosets. Overall, these results may also contribute to a better
understanding of cooperation in humans.

During its most recent outbreak across the Americas, Zika virus (ZIKV) was
surprisingly shown to cause fetal loss and congenital malformations in acutely
and chronically infected pregnant women. However, understanding the underlying
pathogenesis of ZIKV congenital disease has been hampered by a lack of relevant
in vivo experimental models. Here we present a candidate New World monkey model
of ZIKV infection in pregnant marmosets that faithfully recapitulates human
disease. ZIKV inoculation at the human-equivalent of early gestation caused an
asymptomatic seroconversion, induction of type I/II interferon-associated genes
and proinflammatory cytokines, and persistent viremia and viruria. Spontaneous
pregnancy loss was observed 16-18 days post-infection, with extensive active
placental viral replication and fetal neurocellular disorganization similar to
that seen in humans. These findings underscore the key role of the placenta as a 
conduit for fetal infection, and demonstrate the utility of marmosets as a highly
relevant model for studying congenital ZIKV disease and pregnancy loss.

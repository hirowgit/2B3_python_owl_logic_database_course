BACKGROUND: Food avoidance secondary to disease or stress can lead to weight loss
and rapid deterioration of clinical condition in the common marmoset (Callithrix 
jacchus). Currently, there are no data supporting the use of any pharmaceuticals 
as an appetite stimulant in this species; however, benzodiazepines are frequently
used for this purpose in other species.
METHODS: Six marmosets were used in a crossover study design to evaluate the
benzodiazepine midazolam as an appetite stimulant and anxiolytic. Total food
intake (TFI) and latency to eat (LTE) were measured following administration of
oral and injectable midazolam in non-anxious and anxious states.
RESULTS: Injectable midazolam increased TFI and decreased LTE in anxious
marmosets, but had no effect in non-anxious animals. Oral midazolam had no effect
on appetite in either state.
CONCLUSIONS: Injectable midazolam may be an effective treatment for
anxiety-induced inappetence in marmosets. Individual response to both oral and
injectable midazolam may vary.

The common marmoset Callithrix jacchus encodes two glutathione transferase (GST) 
enzymes with ketosteroid double-bond isomerase activity. The most active enzyme
is CjaGST A3-3 showing a specific activity with 5-androsten-3,17-dione (Δ5-AD) of
62.1 ± 1.8 μmol min-1 mg-1, and a kcat value of 261 ± 49 s-1. The second
ketosteroid isomerase CjaGST A1-1 has a 30-fold lower specific activity with
Δ5-AD and a 37-fold lower kcat value. Thus, the marmoset CjaGST A3-3 would be the
main contributor to the biosynthesis of the steroid hormones testosterone and
progesterone, like the human ortholog HsaGST A3-3. Two residues differ in the
H-site of the 91.4% sequence identical CjaGST A1-1 and CjaGST A3-3, and modeling 
of the structures suggests that the bulky phenyl ring of Phe111 in CjaGST A1-1
causes steric hindrance in the binding of the steroid substrate. Tributyltin
acetate (IC50=0.16 ± 0.004 μM) and ethacrynic acid (IC50=3.3 ± 0.2 μM) were found
to be potent inhibitors of CjaGST A3-3, as previously demonstrated with the human
and equine orthologs.

Novel environments induce a conflicting emotional approach-withdrawal state that 
triggers stress-related reactions. Social support through the presence of a
highly familiar conspecific buffers the individual against such challenges.
Although aversive events seem to be predominantly processed by the right
hemisphere, this is still under debate and little is known about functional
cerebral asymmetries in nonhuman primates during novelty stress, isolation and
social buffering. Here we isolated adult marmoset monkeys in a new open-field
arena or in their familiar home-cages to establish hemisphere activity and
whether the pairmate's presence buffers the response. Monkeys socially isolated
in either location had higher circulating cortisol levels than non-isolated
marmosets, but different hemisphere activity patterns indicated by changes in
baseline tympanic membrane temperatures (TMT). The bilateral increase in the
monkeys that were isolated in the unfamiliar location may reflect an
approach-withdrawal conflict. The left-sided increase in the home-cage isolation 
group was negatively related to cortisol release, this being potentially
associated with a more proactive/approach-prone temperament. Interestingly, TMT
and cortisol were unaltered when the pairmate was present. Thus, positive social 
interaction reduces the perceived intensity of the threat, alters hemisphere
asymmetries and blocks the hormonal response to novelty stress, consistent with a
buffering effect.

Literature studies have demonstrated the structural, connectional, and functional
differences between cortical folding patterns in mammalian brains, such as convex
and concave patterns. However, the molecular underpinning of such convex/concave 
differences remains largely unknown. Thanks to public access to a recently
released set of marmoset whole-brain in situ hybridization data by RIKEN, Japan; 
this data's accessibility empowers us to improve our understanding of the
organization, regulation, and function of genes and their relation to macroscale 
metrics of brains. In this work, magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor 
imaging macroscale neuroimaging data in this dataset were used to delineate
convex/concave patterns in marmoset and to examine their structural features.
Machine learning and visualization tools were employed to investigate the
possible transcriptome difference between cortical convex and concave patterns.
Experimental results demonstrated that a collection of genes is differentially
expressed in convex and concave patterns, and their expression profiles can
robustly characterize and differentiate the two folding patterns. More
importantly, neuroscientific interpretations of these differentially expressed
genes, as well as axonal guidance pathway analysis and gene enrichment analysis, 
offer novel understanding of structural and functional differences between
cortical folding patterns in different regions from a molecular perspective.

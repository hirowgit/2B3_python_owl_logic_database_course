Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) is endogenously produced in the skin of primates
when exposed to the appropriate wavelengths of ultraviolet light (UV-B). Common
marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) maintained indoors require dietary provision of
vitamin D3 due to lack of sunlight exposure. The minimum dietary vitamin D3
requirement and the maximum amount of vitamin D3 that can be metabolized by
marmosets is unknown. Observations of metabolic bone disease and gastrointestinal
malabsorption have led to wide variation in dietary vitamin D3 provision amongst 
research institutions, with resulting variation in circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin 
D3 (25(OH)D3 ), the accepted marker for vitamin D sufficiency/deficiency.
Multiple studies have reported serum 25(OH)D3 in captive marmosets, but 25(OH)D3 
is not the final product of vitamin D3 metabolism. In addition to serum 25(OH)D3,
we measured the most physiologically active metabolite, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 
(1,25(OH)2 D3 ), and the less well understood metabolite, 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin 
D3 (24,25(OH)2 D3 ) to characterize the marmoset's ability to metabolize dietary 
vitamin D3 . We present vitamin D3 metabolite and related serum chemistry value
colony reference ranges in marmosets provided diets with 26,367 (Colony A,
N = 113) or 8,888 (Colony B, N = 52) international units (IU) of dietary vitamin 
D3 per kilogram of dry matter. Colony A marmosets had higher serum 25(OH)D3
(426 ng/ml [SD 200] vs. 215 ng/ml [SD 113]) and 24,25(OH)2 D3 (53 ng/ml [SD 35]
vs. 7 ng/ml [SD 5]). There was no difference in serum 1,25(OH)2 D3 between the
colonies. Serum 1,25(OH)2 D3 increased and 25(OH)D3 decreased with age, but the
effect was weak. Marmosets tightly regulate metabolism of dietary vitamin D3 into
the active metabolite 1,25(OH)2 D3 ; excess 25(OH)D3 is metabolized into
24,25(OH)2 D3 . This ability explains the tolerance of high levels of dietary
vitamin D3 by marmosets, however, our data suggest that these high dietary levels
are not required.

The primate brain contains a large number of interconnected visual areas, whose
spatial organization and intracortical projections show a high level of
conservation across species. One fiber pathway of recent interest is the vertical
occipital fasciculus (VOF), which is thought to support communication between
dorsal and ventral visual areas in the occipital lobe. A recent comparative
diffusion MRI (dMRI) study reported that the VOF in the macaque brain bears a
similar topology to that of the human, running superficial and roughly
perpendicular to the optic radiation. The present study reports a comparative
investigation of the VOF in the common marmoset, a small New World monkey whose
lissencephalic brain is approximately tenfold smaller than the macaque and
150-fold smaller than the human. High-resolution ex vivo dMRI of two marmoset
brains revealed an occipital white matter structure that closely resembles that
of the larger primate species, with one notable difference. Namely, unlike in the
macaque and the human, the VOF in the marmoset is spatially fused with other,
more anterior vertical tracts, extending anteriorly between the parietal and
temporal cortices. We compare several aspects of this continuous structure, which
we term the VOF complex (VOF +), and neighboring fasciculi to those of macaques
and humans. We hypothesize that the essential topology of the VOF+ is a conserved
feature of the posterior cortex in anthropoid primates, with a clearer
fragmentation into multiple named fasciculi in larger, more gyrified brains.

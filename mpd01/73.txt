Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a multifactorial disorder with characteristic
synaptic and gene expression changes. Early intervention during childhood is
thought to benefit prognosis. Here, we examined the changes in cortical
synaptogenesis, synaptic function, and gene expression from birth to the juvenile
stage in a marmoset model of ASD induced by valproic acid (VPA) treatment. Early 
postnatally, synaptogenesis was reduced in this model, while juvenile-age
VPA-treated marmosets showed increased synaptogenesis, similar to observations in
human tissue. During infancy, synaptic plasticity transiently increased and was
associated with altered vocalization. Synaptogenesis-related genes were
downregulated early postnatally. At three months of age, the differentially
expressed genes were associated with circuit remodeling, similar to the
expression changes observed in humans. In summary, we provide a functional and
molecular characterization of a non-human primate model of ASD, highlighting its 
similarity to features observed in human ASD.

The technology, methodology and models used by visual neuroscientists have
provided great insights into the structure and function of individual brain
areas. However, complex cognitive functions arise in the brain due to networks
comprising multiple interacting cortical areas that are wired together with
precise anatomical connections. A prime example of this phenomenon is the
frontal-parietal network and two key regions within it: the frontal eye fields
(FEF) and lateral intraparietal area (area LIP). Activity in these cortical areas
has independently been tied to oculomotor control, motor preparation, visual
attention and decision-making. Strong, bidirectional anatomical connections have 
also been traced between FEF and area LIP, suggesting that the aforementioned
visual functions depend on these inter-area interactions. However, advancements
in our knowledge about the interactions between area LIP and FEF are limited with
the main animal model, the rhesus macaque, because these key regions are buried
in the sulci of the brain. In this review, we propose that the common marmoset is
the ideal model for investigating how anatomical connections give rise to
functionally-complex cognitive visual behaviours, such as those modulated by the 
frontal-parietal network, because of the homology of their cortical networks with
humans and macaques, amenability to transgenic technology, and rich behavioural
repertoire. Furthermore, the lissencephalic structure of the marmoset brain
enables application of powerful techniques, such as array-based electrophysiology
and optogenetics, which are critical to bridge the gaps in our knowledge about
structure and function in the brain.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a small New World primate, is receiving
substantial attention in the neuroscience and biomedical science fields because
its anatomical features, functional and behavioral characteristics, and
reproductive features and its amenability to available genetic modification
technologies make it an attractive experimental subject. In this review, I
outline the progress of marmoset neuroscience research and summarize both the
current status (opportunities and limitations) of and the future perspectives on 
the application of marmosets in neuroscience and disease modeling.

Objective.The common marmoset has been increasingly used in neural interfacing
studies due to its smaller size, easier handling, and faster breeding compared to
Old World non-human primate (NHP) species. While assessment of cortical anatomy
in marmosets has shown strikingly similar layout to macaques, comprehensive
assessment of electrophysiological properties underlying forelimb reaching
movements in this bridge species does not exist. The objective of this study is
to characterize electrophysiological properties of signals recorded from the
marmoset primary motor cortex (M1) during a reach task and compare with larger
NHP models such that this smaller NHP model can be used in behavioral neural
interfacing studies.Approach and main results.Neuronal firing rates and local
field potentials (LFPs) were chronically recorded from M1 in three adult, male
marmosets. Firing rates, mu + beta and high gamma frequency bands of LFPs were
evaluated for modulation with respect to movement. Firing rate and regularity of 
neurons of the marmoset M1 were similar to that reported in macaques with a
subset of neurons showing selectivity to movement direction. Movement phases
(rest vs move) was classified from both neural spiking and LFPs. Microelectrode
arrays provide the ability to sample small regions of the motor cortex to drive
brain-machine interfaces (BMIs). The results demonstrate that marmosets are a
robust bridge species for behavioral neuroscience studies with motor cortical
electrophysiological signals recorded from microelectrode arrays that are similar
to Old World NHPs.Significance. As marmosets represent an interesting step
between rodent and macaque models, successful demonstration that neuron
modulation in marmoset motor cortex is analogous to reports in macaques
illustrates the utility of marmosets as a viable species for BMI studies.

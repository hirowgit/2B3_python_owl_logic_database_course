Hybrid palm oil, which contains higher levels of oleic acid and lower saturated
fatty acids in comparison with African palm oil, has been proposed to be somehow 
equivalent to extra virgin olive oil. However, the biological effects of its
consumption are poorly described. Here we have explored the effects of its
overconsumption on lipid metabolism in a non-human primate model, the common
marmoset. Dietary supplementation of marmoset with hyperlipidic diet containing
hybrid palm oil for 3 months did not modify plasma lipids levels, but increased
glucose levels as compared to the supplementation with African palm oil. Liver
volume was unexpectedly found to be more increased in marmosets consuming hybrid 
palm oil than in those consuming African palm oil. Hepatic total lipid content
and circulating transaminases were dramatically increased in animals consuming
hybrid palm oil, as well as an increased degree of fibrosis. Analysis of liver
miRNAs showed a selective modulation of certain miRNAs by hybrid palm oil, some
of which were predicted to target genes involved in cell adhesion molecules and
peroxisomal pathways. Our data suggest that consumption of hybrid palm oil should
be monitored carefully, as its overconsumption compared to that of African palm
oil could involve important alterations to hepatic metabolism.

Unlike visual signals, sound can reach the ears from any direction, and the
ability to localize sounds from all directions is essential for survival in a
natural environment. Previous studies have largely focused on the space in front 
of a subject that is also covered by vision and were often limited to measuring
spatial tuning along the horizontal (azimuth) plane. As a result, we know
relatively little about how the auditory cortex responds to sounds coming from
spatial locations outside the frontal space where visual information is
unavailable. By mapping single-neuron responses to the full spatial field in
awake marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), an arboreal animal for which spatial
processing is vital in its natural habitat, we show that spatial receptive fields
in several auditory areas cover all spatial locations. Several complementary
measures of spatial tuning showed that neurons were tuned to both frontal space
and rear space (outside the coverage of vision), as well as the space above and
below the horizontal plane. Together, these findings provide valuable new
insights into the representation of all spatial locations by primate auditory
cortex.

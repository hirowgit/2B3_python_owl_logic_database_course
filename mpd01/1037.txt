Here, we compared the growth kinetics, cell-to-cell spread, and virus
internalization kinetics in N2a cells of RABV variants isolated from vampire bats
(V-3), domestic dogs (V-2) and marmosets (V-M) as well as the clinical symptoms
and mortality caused by these variants. The replication rate of V-3 was
significantly higher than those of V-2 and V-M. However, the uptake and spread of
these RABV variants into N2a cells were inversely proportional. Nevertheless, V-3
had longer incubation and evolution periods. Our results provide evidence that
the clinical manifestations of infection with bat RABV variant occur at a later
time when compared to what was observed with canine and marmoset rabies virus
variants.

A 5-y-old multiparous female common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) presented with 
acute weight loss of approximately 25% over a 1-wk period. An abdominal mass was 
apparent on physical examination, and radiographs suggested peritoneal effusion. 
Exploratory laparotomy revealed hemoperitoneum and an enlarged, gray,
hemorrhaging uterus; ovariohysterectomy was performed, and the marmoset
recovered. Histologic evaluation of the ovaries and uterus revealed uterine
rupture, with invasion of placental villi lined by trophoblasts through the
myometrium to the serosal layer. Primary uterine rupture is a rare but serious
obstetric event in humans and has been reported only rarely in NHP. This report
is the first description of primary uterine rupture during early pregnancy in a
common marmoset.

BACKGROUND: Human chromosome 19 has many unique characteristics including gene
density more than double the genome-wide average and 20 large tandemly clustered 
gene families. It also has the highest GC content of any chromosome, especially
outside gene clusters. The high GC content and concomitant high content of
hypermutable CpG sites raises the possibility chromosome 19 exhibits higher
levels of nucleotide diversity both within and between species, and may possess
greater variation in DNA methylation that regulates gene expression.
RESULTS: We examined GC and CpG content of chromosome 19 orthologs across
representatives of the primate order. In all 12 primate species with suitable
genome assemblies, chromosome 19 orthologs have the highest GC content of any
chromosome. CpG dinucleotides and CpG islands are also more prevalent in
chromosome 19 orthologs than other chromosomes. GC and CpG content are generally 
higher outside the gene clusters. Intra-species variation based on SNPs in human 
common dbSNP, rhesus, crab eating macaque, baboon and marmoset datasets is most
prevalent on chromosome 19 and its orthologs. Inter-species comparisons based on 
phyloP conservation show accelerated nucleotide evolution for chromosome 19
promoter flanking and enhancer regions. These same regulatory regions show the
highest CpG density of any chromosome suggesting they possess considerable
methylome regulatory potential.
CONCLUSIONS: The pattern of high GC and CpG content in chromosome 19 orthologs,
particularly outside gene clusters, is present from human to mouse lemur
representing 74 million years of primate evolution. Much CpG variation exists
both within and between primate species with a portion of this variation
occurring in regulatory regions.

Background: Primary human hepatocytes (PHHs) are the ideal candidates for
studying critical liver functions such as drug metabolism and toxicity. However, 
as they are isolated from discarded livers that are unsuitable for
transplantation, they possess limited expansion ability in vitro and their
enzymatic functions deteriorate rapidly because they are often of poor quality.
Therefore, there is a compelling reason to find reliable alternative sources of
hepatocytes.
Methods: In this study, we report on efficient and robust differentiation of
embryonic stem cells (ESC) from the common marmoset Callithrix jacchus into
functional hepatocyte-like cells (HLC) using a simple, and reproducible
three-step procedure. ESC-derived HLCs were examined by morphological analysis
and tested for their expression of hepatocyte-specific markers using a
combination of immunohistochemistry, RT-PCR, and biochemical assays. Primary
human hepatocytes were used as controls.
Results: ESC-derived HLCs expressed each of the hepatocyte-specific markers
tested, including albumin; α-fetoprotein; asialoglycoprotein receptor 1; α-1
antitrypsin; hepatocyte nuclear factors 1α and 4; cytokeratin 18; hepatocyte
growth factor receptor; transferrin; tyrosine aminotransferase; alkaline
phosphatase; c-reactive protein; cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP1A2, CYP2E1 and
CYP3A4; and coagulation factors FVII and FIX. They were functionally competent as
demonstrated by biochemical assays in addition to producing urea.
Conclusion: Our data strongly suggest that marmoset HLCs possess characteristics 
similar to those of PHHs. They could, therefore, be invaluable for studies on
drug metabolism and cell transplantation therapy for a variety of liver
disorders. Because of the similarities in the anatomical and physiological
features of the common marmoset to that of humans, Callithrix jacchus is an
appropriate animal model to study human disease conditions and cellular
functions.

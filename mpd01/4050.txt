A strain of Bacteroides fragilis, isolated from the marmoset Callithrix
penicillata, produced protein(s) with bacteriocin activity (fragicilin). Two
active fractions (36 and 150 kDa) were isolated by chromatography. The
bacteriocin exhibited iso- and heteroantagonism. It remained stable between pH 3 
and 10 and at 60 degrees C for 24 h. Pronase, trypsin, proteinase K and type VII 
protease inactivated the bacteriocin, giving evidence of its protein nature.

Marmosets injected intrahepatically with nucleic acids (cDNA and RNA transcripts)
representing the full-length genome of the wild-type HM-175 strain of hepatitis A
virus experienced acute hepatitis and seroconversion to hepatitis A virus capsid 
proteins. The hepatitis was comparable in severity to that caused by infection
with the wild-type virus. The viral cDNA and the hepatitis A virus recovered from
the feces of an injected animal contained the same marker mutation. Therefore,
intermediate cell culture steps can be omitted and the virulence of a hepatitis A
virus encoded by a cDNA clone can be evaluated by direct transfection of
marmosets.

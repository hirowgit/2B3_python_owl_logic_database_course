Histochemical studies on the submandibular ganglia of marmosets (Callithrix
jacchus and Callithrix penecillata).

Miraglia T, Moura CS, Hufnagel Barbosa JA.

The histochemistry of the neural cells was studied in the submandibular ganglia
of 5 Callithrix jacchus (3 males and 2 females) and 4 Callithrix penicillata (2
males and 2 females). These cells contain neutral mucopolysaccharides,
nucleoproteins and lipidic materia, but are apparently devoid of glycogen. It is 
impossible to demonstrate in them any reactivity for UDPG-GT, phosphorylases,
ATPase at pH 6.3, leucine aminopeptidase and alanyl aminopeptidas. The reaction
for the other searched enzymes was as follows: weak (F-1,6-P Ald and cytochrome
oxidase), weak to moderate (ADH, 6-P-GDH, ICDH, SDH, MDH, alpha-GPDH and
beta-OHBDH), moderate (G-6-PDH, F-1,6-PA, LDH and GDH), moderate to strong
(ATPase at pH 7.4, nonspecific esterase and acid phosphatase) and strong (G-6-PA,
NADH2,-TR, NADPH2-TR, ATPase at pH 8.5 and 9.4 and alkaline phosphatase).

In vitro transforming activity of EBV. I-Establishment and properties of two EBV 
strains (M81 and M72) produced by immortalized Callithrix jacchus lymphocytes.

Desgranges C, Lenoir G, de-Th√© G, Seigneurin JM, Hilgers J, Dubouch P.

In vitro transformation of Callithrix jacchus marmoset lymphocytes was achieved
with a nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) derived Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) strain,
HKLY-28. Two permanent and virus producing lymphoblastoid cell lines, M81 and
M72, were obtained. Comparison between the original HKLY-28 line and both M81 and
M72 lines showed that passage in the marmosets lymphocytes greatly enhanced viral
production and transforming activity of the virus as observed in cottontop
derived B95.8 lymphoblastoid line.

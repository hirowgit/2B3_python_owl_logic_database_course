Disruption of microbial communities within human hosts has been associated with
infection, obesity, cognitive decline, cancer risk and frailty, suggesting that
microbiome-targeted therapies may be an option for improving healthspan and
lifespan. The objectives of this study were to determine the feasibility of
delivering fecal microbiota transplants (FMTs) to marmosets via oral gavage and
to evaluate if alteration of the gut microbiome post-FMT could be achieved. This 
was a prospective study of marmosets housed at the Barshop Institute for
Longevity and Aging Studies in San Antonio, Texas. Eligible animals included
healthy young adult males (age 2-5 years) with no recent medication use. Stool
from two donors was combined and administered in 0.5 ml doses to five young
recipients once weekly for 3 weeks. Safety outcomes and alterations in the gut
microbiome composition via 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing were compared at baseline
and monthly up to 6 months post-FMT. Overall, significant differences in the
percent relative abundance was seen in FMT recipients at the phylum and family
levels from baseline to 1 month and baseline to 6 months post-FMT. In
permutational multivariate analysis of variance analyses, treatment status (donor
vs. recipient) (p = .056) and time course (p = .019) predicted β diversity
(p = .056). The FMT recipients did not experience any negative health outcomes
over the course of the treatment. FMT via oral gavage was safe to administer to
young adult marmosets. The marmoset microbiome may be altered by FMT; however,
progressive changes in the microbiome are strongly driven by the host and its
baseline microbiome composition.

The use of home-based image sensors for biological and environmental monitoring
provides novel insight into health and development but it is difficult to
evaluate people during their normal activities in their home. Therefore, we
developed a low-cost infrared (IR) technology-based motion, location, temperature
and thermal environment detection system that can be used non-invasively for
long-term studies in the home environment. We tested this technology along with
the associated analysis algorithm to visualize the effects of parental care and
thermal environment on developmental state change in a non-human primate model,
the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). To validate this system, we first
compared it to a manual analysis technique and we then assessed the development
of circadian rhythms in common marmosets from postnatal day 15-45. The
semi-automatically tracked biological indices of locomotion velocity (BV) and
body surface temperature (BT) and the potential psychological index of place
preference toward the door (BD), showed age-dependent shifts in circadian phase
patterns. Although environmental variables appeared to affect circadian rhythm
development, principal component analysis and signal superimposing imaging
methods revealed a novel phasic pattern of BD-BT correlation day/night switching 
in animals older than postnatal day 38 (approximately equivalent to one year of
age in humans). The origin of this switch was related to earlier development of
body temperature (BT) rhythms and alteration of psychological behavior rhythms
(BD) around earlier feeding times. We propose that this cost-effective, inclusive
sensing and analytic technique has value for understanding developmental care
conditions for which continual home non-invasive monitoring would be beneficial
and further suggest the potential to adapt this technique for use in humans.

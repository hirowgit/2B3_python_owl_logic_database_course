Fused in sarcoma (FUS) is an RNA binding protein that is involved in
frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).
To establish the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) as a model for FTLD, we
generated a stereotaxic injection-based marmoset model of FUS-silencing. We
designed shRNAs against the marmoset FUS gene and generated an AAV9 virus
encoding the most effective shRNA against FUS (shFUS). The AAV encoding shFUS
(AAV-shFUS) was introduced into the frontal cortex of young adult marmosets,
whereas AAV encoding a control shRNA was injected into the contralateral side. We
obtained approximately 70-80% silencing of FUS following AAV-shFUS injection.
Interestingly, FUS-silencing provoked a proliferation of astrocytes and
microglias. Since FTLD is characterized by various emotional deficits, it would
be helpful to establish a marmoset model of FUS-silencing in various brain
tissues for investigating the pathomechanism of higher cognitive and behavioral
dysfunction.

Previous studies showed that olfactory cues are important for mammalian
communication. However, many specific compounds that convey information between
conspecifics are still unknown. To understand mechanisms and functions of
olfactory cues, olfactory signals such as volatile compounds emitted from
individuals need to be assessed. Sampling of animals with and without scent
glands was typically conducted using cotton swabs rubbed over the skin or fur and
analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). However, this method
has various drawbacks, including a high level of contaminations. Thus, we adapted
two methods of volatile sampling from other research fields and compared them to 
sampling with cotton swabs. To do so we assessed the body odor of common
marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) using cotton swabs, thermal desorption (TD) tubes 
and, alternatively, a mobile GC-MS device containing a thermal desorption trap.
Overall, TD tubes comprised most compounds (N = 113), with half of those
compounds being volatile (N = 52). The mobile GC-MS captured the fewest compounds
(N = 35), of which all were volatile. Cotton swabs contained an intermediate
number of compounds (N = 55), but very few volatiles (N = 10). Almost all
compounds found with the mobile GC-MS were also captured with TD tubes (94%).
Hence, we recommend TD tubes for state of the art sampling of body odor of
mammals or other vertebrates, particularly for field studies, as they can be
easily transported, stored and analysed with high performance instruments in the 
lab. Nevertheless, cotton swabs capture compounds which still may contribute to
the body odor, e.g. after bacterial fermentation, while profiles from mobile
GC-MS include only the most abundant volatiles of the body odor.

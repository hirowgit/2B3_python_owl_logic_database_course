Drugs modulating the metabotropic glutamate type 2 receptor (mGluR2) activity may
have therapeutic benefits in treating a large spectrum of neuro-psychiatric
disorders, from schizophrenia to Parkinson's disease, both as a symptomatic
therapy and potential disease-modifying paradigm. LY-487,379 is a highly
selective mGluR2 positive allosteric modulator that is widely used to study
mGluR2 function using experimental animal models. The common marmoset is a small 
primate that has long been used in neuroscience. However, given its small size
and small circulating blood volume, conducting studies to determine the PK
profile of LY-487,379 is challenging. We developed and validated a sensitive and 
selective analytical method that enables quantification of LY-487,379 using a
limited volume of plasma (10 μL). The analytical method consists of protein
precipitation followed by high-performance liquid chromatography with heat
assisted electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HPLC-HESI-MS/MS). The
chromatographic separation was achieved using gradient elution with a mobile
phase consisting of acetonitrile and 0.01% formic acid in water on a Thermo
Scientific Aquasil C18 analytical column (100 × 2.1 mm I.D., 5 μm) operating at
40 °C and at a flow rate of 300 μL/min. The method displays a linear relationship
ranging from 0.2 to 100 ng/mL. Intra- and inter-day relative standard deviations 
are <1.4% and 7.9%, respectively and the relative error ranged from -6.9 to 9.7%.
The method was used to quantify LY-487,379 in both rat and marmoset plasma, and
PK parameters were determined after a single subcutaneous dose of 1.0 mg kg-1 in 
both species and significant differences in Cmax, AUC and T1/2 were observed.

Porous silicon nanoparticles (pSiNP), modified to target dendritic cells (DC),
provide an alternate strategy for the delivery of immunosuppressive drugs. Here, 
we aimed to develop a DC-targeting pSiNP displaying c-type lectin, dendritic
cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN), 
and CD11c monoclonal antibodies. The in vivo tracking of these fluorescent
DC-targeting nanoparticles was assessed in both C57BL/6 mice and common marmosets
( Callithrix jacchus) by intravenous injection (20 mg/kg). Rapamycin and
ovalbumin (OVA)323-339 peptide loaded pSiNP were employed to evaluate their
ability to generate murine CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ regulatory T-cells in vivo within OVA 
sensitized mice. In vivo, pSiNP migrated to the liver, kidneys, lungs, and spleen
in both mice and marmosets. Flow cytometry confirmed pSiNP uptake by splenic and 
peripheral blood DC when functionalized with targeting antibodies. C57BL/6 OVA
sensitized mice injected with CD11c-pSiNP loaded with rapamycin + OVA323-339
produced a 5-fold higher number of splenic regulatory T-cells compared to control
mice, at 40 days post-pSiNP injection. These results demonstrate the importance
of the immobilized targeting antibodies to enhance cellular uptake and enable the
in vivo generation of splenic regulatory T-cells.

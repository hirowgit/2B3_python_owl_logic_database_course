A laboratory experiment was conducted in order to explore the possibility of
imitation, that is, response learning by observation, in marmosets, Callithrix
jacchusInexperienced individuals were allowed to observe a skilful model that
demonstrated one of two possible techniques (pushing or pulling a pendulum-door) 
to get food from inside a wooden box. Their initial manipulative actions,
performed when exposed to the box in a subsequent test, were compared with those 
of naive control subjects (non-observers). The observers showed less exploratory 
behaviour than the non-observers and, more importantly, some showed a strong
tendency to use the demonstrated opening technique in the initial test phase.
This initial preference disappeared in the course of five test sessions and the
observers converged towards the simpler, alternative solution that was generally 
preferred by the non-observers. Despite fundamental individual differences in the
observer group and the failure to find a significant group effect, the results
indicate that marmosets are capable of learning simple motor skills through
conspecific observation.Copyright 1997 The Association for the Study of Animal

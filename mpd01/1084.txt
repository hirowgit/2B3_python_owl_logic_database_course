Developments in microfabrication technology have enabled the production of neural
electrode arrays with hundreds of closely spaced recording sites, and electrodes 
with thousands of sites are under development. These probes in principle allow
the simultaneous recording of very large numbers of neurons. However, use of this
technology requires the development of techniques for decoding the spike times of
the recorded neurons from the raw data captured from the probes. Here we present 
a set of tools to solve this problem, implemented in a suite of practical,
user-friendly, open-source software. We validate these methods on data from the
cortex, hippocampus and thalamus of rat, mouse, macaque and marmoset,
demonstrating error rates as low as 5%.

In combination with advances in analytical methods, resting-state fMRI is
allowing unprecedented access to a better understanding of the network
organization of the brain. Increasing evidence suggests that this architecture
may incorporate highly functionally connected nodes, or "hubs", and we have
recently proposed local functional connectivity density (lFCD) mapping to
identify highly-connected nodes in the human brain. Here, we imaged awake
nonhuman primates to test whether, like the human brain, the marmoset brain
contains FC hubs. Ten adult common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) were acclimated
to mild, comfortable restraint using individualized helmets. Following restraint 
training, resting BOLD data were acquired during eight consecutive 10 min scans
for each subject. lFCD revealed prominent cortical and subcortical hubs of
connectivity across the marmoset brain; specifically, in primary and secondary
visual cortices (V1/V2), higher-order visual association areas (A19M/V6[DM]),
posterior parietal and posterior cingulate areas (PGM and A23b/A31), thalamus,
dorsal and ventral striatal areas (caudate, putamen, lateral septal nucleus, and 
anterior cingulate cortex (A24a). lFCD hubs were highly connected to widespread
areas of the brain, and further revealed significant network-network
interactions. These data provide a baseline platform for future investigations in
a nonhuman primate model of the brain's network topology.

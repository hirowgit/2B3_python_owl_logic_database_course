Peripheral plasma levels of progesterone, oestradiol-17 beta, oestrone,
testosterone, androstenedione and chorionic gonadotrophin during pregnancy in the
marmoset monkey, Callithrix jacchus.

Chambers PL, Hearn JP.

Concentrations of LH/CG, androstenedione and testosterone rose in early pregnancy
to maximum values at 6--10 weeks. Thereafter LH/CG levels declined and
androstenedione and testosterone levels remained at plateau values or declined
until term. Progesterone, oestradiol-17 beta and oestrone increased after
ovulation and remained high throughout pregnancy. At 12 weeks, when LH/CG levels 
were falling, progesterone and oestradiol rose well above the luteal-phase levels
which were maintained for the first 12 weeks. Progesterone declined in the 2
weeks before birth, while oestradiol and oestrone remained high. Pregnancies of
an unknown stage were dated by reference to a graph of uterine diameter, measured
by abdominal palpation, in animals at known times after conception. Measurement
of progesterone concentrations during the conception cycle gave more accurate
dating and showed that the gestation length was 144 days.

'Collaborative' rearing of marmoset triplets.

Hearn JP, Burden FJ.

A system of management is described in which all 3 offspring from triplet births 
to Callithrix jacchus can be successfully reared to weaning. Hand-rearing
techniques are applied to the offspring in turn without depriving them of the
maternal and family influences necessary for normal behavioural development.

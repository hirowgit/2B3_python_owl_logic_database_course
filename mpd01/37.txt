BACKGROUND: Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a major causative agent of acute hepatitis
worldwide, prompting continuous HEV vaccine efforts. Vaccine development is
hampered by the lack of convenient animal models susceptible to infection with
different HEV genotypes. We produced recombinant open reading frame 2 protein
(pORF2; p551) of HEV genotype (GT) 3 and assessed its immunogenicity and
protectivity against HEV challenge in common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus, CM).
METHODS: p551 with consensus sequence corresponding to amino acid residues
110-660 of HEV GT3 pORF2 was expressed in E. coli and purified by affinity
chromatography. CMs were immunized intramuscularly with 20 μg of p551 VLPs with
alum adjuvant (n = 4) or adjuvant alone (n = 2) at weeks 0, 3, 7 and 19. At week 
27, p551-immunized and control animals were challenged with HEV GT1 or GT3 and
thereafter longitudinally screened for markers of liver function, anti-HEV IgG
and HEV RNA in feces and sera.
RESULTS: Purified p551 formed VLPs with particle size of 27.71 ± 2.42 nm. Two
immunizations with p551 induced anti-HEV IgG mean titer of 1:1810. Immunized CMs 
challenged with homologous and heterologous HEV genotype did not develop HEV
infection during the follow-up. Control CMs infected with both HEV GT1 and GT3
demonstrated signs of HEV infection with virus shedding and elevation of the
levels of liver enzymes. High levels of anti-HEV IgG persisted in vaccinated CMs 
and control CMs that resolved HEV infection, for up to two years post challenge.
CONCLUSIONS: CMs are shown to be a convenient laboratory animal model susceptible
to infection with HEV GT1 and GT3. Immunization with HEV GT3 ORF2/p551 triggers
potent anti-HEV antibody response protecting CMs from homologous and heterologous
HEV challenge. This advances p551 in VLPs as a prototype vaccine against HEV.

Owing to genotype-specific neutralizing antibodies, analyzing differences in the 
immunogenic variation among dengue virus (DENV) genotypes is central to effective
vaccine development. Herein, we characterized the viral kinetics and antibody
response induced by DENV type 2 Asian I (AI) and Asian/American (AA) genotypes
using marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) as models. Two groups of marmosets were
inoculated with AI and AA genotypes, and serial plasma samples were collected.
Viremia levels were determined using quantitative reverse transcription-PCR,
plaque assays, and antigen enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Anti-DENV
immunoglobulin M and G antibodies, neutralizing antibody titer, and
antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) activity were determined using ELISA, plaque
reduction neutralization test, and ADE assay, respectively. The AI genotype
induced viremia for a longer duration, but the AA genotype induced higher levels 
of viremia. After four months, the neutralizing antibody titer induced by the AA 
genotype remained high, but that induced by the AI genotype waned. ADE activity
toward Cosmopolitan genotypes was detected in marmosets inoculated with the AI
genotype. These findings indicate discrepancies between heterologous genotypes
that influence neutralizing antibodies and viremia in marmosets, a critical issue
in vaccine development.

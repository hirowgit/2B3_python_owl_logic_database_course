Six strains of serotypes 1 or 2 of Y. pseudotuberculosis were isolated from dead 
squirrel monkeys, a cotton-top tamarin and a marmoset hybrid. All strains
harboured a 71.6 kb plasmid, all were totally oxacillin-resistant and partially
resistant to cephalosporins. Biochemically, serotypes 1 and 2 differed from each 
other in their beta-galactosidase production in a nonfermenter system, whereas
the lack of rhamnose, maltose, salicin and trehalose fermentation seemed to be
attributable to technical causes.

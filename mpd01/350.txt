Treatment of epilepsy remains difficult because patients suffer from
pharmacoresistant forms of the disease and drug side-effects. Thus, there is an
urgent need to identify not only new antiepileptic drug candidates but also novel
epileptic animal models. Here, we characterize seizures induced with kainic acid 
(KA) in the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). Adult marmosets received 0.1,
1, or 10 mg/kg of KA subcutaneously. All animals exhibited early convulsive
behavior (seizure scores of I and II on the Racine scale). Seizure scores were
low at lower KA doses, but the highest dose of KA tested triggered generalized
seizures (scores IV and V on the Racine scale). We next performed preliminary
evaluation of the efficacy of the antiepileptic drug diazepam. This drug at
1 mg/kg (delivered subcutaneously) prevented 10 mg/kg KA-induced stage V
seizures. KA administration to marmosets reliably triggers generalized seizures; 
therefore, the marmoset is a useful animal model in which to analyze the seizures
of a nonhuman primate brain and to develop new treatments for epilepsy.

Understanding the principles of neuronal connectivity requires tools for
efficient quantification and visualization of large datasets. The primate cortex 
is particularly challenging due to its complex mosaic of areas, which in many
cases lack clear boundaries. Here, we introduce a resource that allows
exploration of results of 143 retrograde tracer injections in the marmoset
neocortex. Data obtained in different animals are registered to a common
stereotaxic space using an algorithm guided by expert delineation of histological
borders, allowing accurate assignment of connections to areas despite
interindividual variability. The resource incorporates tools for analyses
relative to cytoarchitectural areas, including statistical properties such as the
fraction of labeled neurons and the percentage of supragranular neurons. It also 
provides purely spatial (parcellation-free) data, based on the stereotaxic
coordinates of 2 million labeled neurons. This resource helps bridge the gap
between high-density cellular connectivity studies in rodents and imaging-based
analyses of human brains.

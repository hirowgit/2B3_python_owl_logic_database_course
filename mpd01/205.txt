Obtaining a good prior for the linear pharmacokinetics of new monoclonal
antibodies (mAbs) would be an advantage not only for designing first-in-human
(FIH) studies but also for stabilizing fitting of data with non-linear
target-mediated disposition models. We estimated the pharmacokinetics from FIH
studies for five mAbs using a two-compartment model, both separately and
together, using a simple pool, a third hierarchical level of random effects for
between mAb differences and non-human-primate half-lives as a predictor covariate
for said differences. There was good agreement between compounds for the rapidly 
accessible central volume of 2.9 L (70 kg human), but clearances and peripheral
volumes differed with terminal half-lives ranging from 15 to 28 days. The simple 
pool of human studies gave inter-individual variability estimates of 32%
coefficient of variation (CV) for clearance and 33% CV for peripheral volume,
larger than for separate fits (13-26% CV and 15-35% CV for clearance and volume
respectively). Using third level hierarchical random effects gave
inter-individual variability estimates close to those of separate fits (24% and
16% CV respectively). The between-mAb differences became predictable if non-human
primate body weight scaled terminal half-life estimates were included as
covariates on clearance and peripheral volume. In conclusion, ignoring inter-mAb 
variation leads to inflated estimates of inter-individual variability and
unrealistic simulations for FIH studies. However, by using 70 kg body weight
scaled terminal half-life estimates from non-human primates one can account for
between-mAb differences and provide non-inflated priors for the linear
pharmacokinetic parameters of new mAbs.

The location and distribution of the calcium-binding protein calbindin-D28k (CB) 
has been considered to be of great value as a neuronal marker for identifying
distinct brain regions and discrete neuronal populations. In the amygdaloid
complex (AC), the balance of excitatory and inhibitory inputs is controlled by CB
immunoreactive interneurons. Alterations of inhibitory mechanisms in the AC may
play a role in the emotional symptomatology of neurological diseases like
Alzheimer's and psychiatric disorders like posttraumatic stress disorder. The
present investigation examined the distribution and morphology of CB-containing
neurons, neuropils and fibers in marmoset monkey ACs by using immunohistochemical
and morphometrical methods. We recognized four types of CB cells in the AC: type 
1 (multipolar), type 2 (spherical or bipolar), type 3 (pyramidal) and type 4
(halo cells), a cell type specific to the marmoset located in the basal and
central nuclei. We detected CB cells in all nuclei and areas of the AC, where
most of the cells were present in the deep nuclei (lateral, basal, accessory
basal and paralaminar). In the superficial nuclei (the nucleus of the lateral
olfactory tract, medial nucleus, periamygdaloid cortex and cortical nuclei), the 
CB cells were abundant in layers 2 and 3. The intercalated nuclei contained small
densely packed cells. The CB neuropils were particularly dense in layer 1 of the 
superficial nuclei, in the deep nuclei and in the amygdalohippocampal area. Large
CB immunoreactive neurons in the white matter and fibers with varicosities were
found in the myelin tracts that surrounded the AC. These findings are the first
step in determining whether some of these cells are specifically disrupted in
pathological states.

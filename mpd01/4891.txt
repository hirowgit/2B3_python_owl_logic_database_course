Epstein-Barr virus: experimental infection of Callithrix jacchus marmosets.

Falk L, Deinhardt F, Wolfe L, Johnson D, Hilgers J, de-Th√© G.

Eight common marmoset monkeys (Callithrix jacchus) were inoculated with about
10(4) transforming units of B95-8 virus; seven of the marmosets died 50-111 days 
post inoculation and all seven showed microscopic and/or macroscopic lesions
compatible with a diagnosis of lymphoproliferative disease. Low levels of
anti-VCA antibodies were detected in plasma from six marmosets. Attempts failed
to establish continuous EBV-carrying lymphoblastoid cell cultures by cultivation 
in vitro of circulating lymphocytes or minced lymphoid tissues obtained at
necropsy.

An outbreak of shigellosis in laboratory marmosets and tamarins (Family:
Callithricidae).

Cooper JE, Needham JR.

An outbreak of shigellosis due to Shigella sonnei, is reported in laboratory
maintained marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) and tamarins (Saguinus nigricollis).
The clinical signs and pathological lesions are described and the microbiological
findings discussed. Control of the disease was based upon hygiene and antibiotic 
therapy and the consequences of this approach are described in detail.

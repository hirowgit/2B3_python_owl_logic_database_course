Stem cell technologies are particularly attractive in Parkinson's disease (PD)
research although they occasionally need long-term treatment for
anti-parkinsonian activity. Unfortunately,
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) widely used as a model for PD
has several limitations, including the risk of dose-dependent mortality and the
difficulty of maintenance of PD symptoms during the whole experiment period.
Therefore, we tested if our novel MPTP regimen protocol (2 mg/kg for 2
consecutive days and 1 mg/kg for next 3 consecutive days) can be maintained
stable parkinsonism without mortality for long-term stem cell therapy. For this, 
we used small-bodied common marmoset monkeys (Callithrix jacchus) among several
nonhuman primates showing high anatomical, functional, and behavioral
similarities to humans. Along with no mortality, the behavioral changes involved 
in PD symptoms were maintained for 32 weeks. Also, the loss of jumping ability of
the MPTP-treated marmosets in the Tower test was not recovered by 32 weeks.
Positron emission tomography (PET) analysis revealed that remarkable decreases of
bindings of 18F-FP-CIT were observed at the striatum of the brains of the
marmosets received MPTP during the full period of the experiment for 32 weeks. In
the substantia nigra of the marmosets, the loss of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)
immunoreactivity was also observed at 32 weeks following the MPTP treatment. In
conclusion, our low-dose MPTP regimen protocol was found to be stable
parkinsonism without mortality as evidenced by behavior, PET, and TH
immunohistochemistry. This result will be useful for evaluation of possible
long-term stem cell therapy for anti-parkinsonian activity.

Mirror neurons respond when executing a motor act and when observing others'
similar act. So far, mirror neurons have been found only in macaques, humans, and
songbirds. To investigate the degree of phylogenetic specialization of mirror
neurons during the course of their evolution, we determined whether mirror
neurons with similar properties to macaques occur in a New World monkey, the
common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). The ventral premotor cortex (PMv), where
mirror neurons have been reported in macaques, is difficult to identify in
marmosets, since no sulcal landmarks exist in the frontal cortex. We addressed
this problem using "in vivo" connection imaging methods. That is, we first
identified cells responsive to others' grasping action in a clear landmark, the
superior temporal sulcus (STS), under anesthesia, and injected fluorescent
tracers into the region. By fluorescence stereomicroscopy, we identified clusters
of labeled cells in the ventrolateral frontal cortex, which were confirmed to be 
within the ventrolateral frontal cortex including PMv after sacrifice. We next
implanted electrodes into the ventrolateral frontal cortex and STS and recorded
single/multi-units under an awake condition. As a result, we found neurons in the
ventrolateral frontal cortex with characteristic "mirror" properties quite
similar to those in macaques. This finding suggests that mirror neurons occur in 
a common ancestor of New and Old World monkeys and its common properties are
preserved during the course of primate evolution.

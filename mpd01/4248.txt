The ability of strains of the B. fragilis group, isolated from the oral cavity
and intestine of marmosets, to produce bacteriorin-like substances in solid
medium, in terms of auto-, iso- and heteroantagonism, was evaluated. Antagonistic
activity was exhibited by 52% of the intestinal strains, 3 of which showed
autoantagonistic activity. Three out of 9 oral strains isolated, tested against
themselves, showed simultaneous isoantagonism to 4 indicator strains; but not
autoantagonism. The same 9 oral strains, when tested against 16 reference
strains, revealed interspecific activity only against 2 Gram-positive
microorganisms. Higher activity, evaluated by the size of the inhibition halo,
was observed in BHI-S agar, and greatest inhibition was obtained after 72 h of
incubation.

We determined the amylase levels in serum samples from six callitrichid species. 
The normal serum amylase values for all of these species was within or higher
than the normal human range. Amylase values higher than the normal range occurred
not only in association with pancreatitis but also pyometra, bone fracture,
abscesses, diabetes mellitus and gastrointestinal conditions leading to diarrhea.
We concluded that although serum amylase activity may be helpful in diagnosing
pancreatitis, it is, as in humans, not specific for this condition in
callitrichids.

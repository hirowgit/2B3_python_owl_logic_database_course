A comparison of craniofacial growth between two colonies of marmosets (Callithrix
jacchus).

Townsend GC, White J, Goss AN.

General and craniofacial measurements from young marmosets in a recently
established Australian colony are presented and compared with similar data
published for a long-established colony in the United Kingdom. Statistically
significant differences between the colonies were those associated with large
error variances, suggesting difficulties in locating certain landmarks rather
than real differences in growth. Thus, direct comparison can be made between
craniofacial growth studies conducted at these two different marmoset colonies.

Radiographic evaluation of appendicular skeletal maturation in the common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).

Schultea TD, Smallwood JE, Stott GG.

The thoracic appendicular skeletal development of five common marmosets was
monitored radiographically at weekly intervals from 1 day to 94 weeks of age and 
the times of appearance and fusion of 47 ossification centers were recorded. A
range and average age for the appearance and fusion of each ossification center
were calculated and compared to data available for the rhesus monkey and man.

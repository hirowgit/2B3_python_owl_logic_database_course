BACKGROUND: The D1/D2 dopamine agonist apomorphine has poor oral bioavailability,
necessitating subcutaneous administration in the treatment of Parkinson's disease
(PD). Acute subcutaneous injection is used as rescue therapy from "off" periods, 
whereas continuous subcutaneous infusion is used to increase "on" periods and to 
reduce dyskinesia when oral treatment fails. An orally active derivative of
apomorphine would avoid the need for parenteral administration. We now describe
the effects of the orally active compound
R-(-)-11-O-valeryl-N-n-propylnoraporphine (11-OH-NPa valerate) on reversal of
motor disability and expression of dyskinesia in
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated, l-dopa-primed
dyskinetic common marmosets.
METHODS: Locomotor activity, motor disability, and dyskinesia were assessed in
MPTP-treated marmosets following the administration of apomorphine (0.075 mg/kg, 
subcutaneous and 0.28 to 1.12 mg/kg, oral) and 11-OH-NPa valerate (0.19, 0.38,
and 0.75mg/kg, oral).
RESULTS: Subcutaneous administration of apomorphine (0.075 mg/kg) produced a
short-lasting reversal of motor disability and the expression of established
dyskinesia, but when administered orally (0.28-1.12 mg/kg) it had no effect. In
contrast, oral treatment with 11-OH-NPa valerate (0.19 and 0.75 mg/kg) induced a 
dose-related reversal of motor disability and increased locomotor activity with
only mild to moderate dyskinesia. Only at the highest dose (0.75 mg/kg) was
marked dyskinesia seen accompanying an extended period of motor disability
reversal and increased locomotor activity.
CONCLUSION: Oral administration of 11-OH-NPa valerate produced a rapid reversal
of motor disability and, at effective dose levels, had a limited propensity to
induce dyskinesia. 11-OH-NPa valerate is the first orally active derivative of
apomorphine with potential for use in PD. © 2016 International Parkinson and

Two learning mechanisms contribute to decision-making: goal-directed actions and 
the "habit" system, by which action-outcome and stimulus-response associations
are formed, respectively. Rodent lesion studies and human neuroimaging have
implicated both the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the orbitofrontal cortex 
(OFC) in the neural basis of contingency learning, a critical component of
goal-directed actions, though some published findings are conflicting. We sought 
to reconcile the existing literature by comparing the effects of excitotoxic
lesions of the perigenual anterior cingulate cortex (pgACC), a region of the
mPFC, and OFC on contingency learning in the marmoset monkey using a
touchscreen-based paradigm, in which the contingent relationship between one of a
pair of actions and its outcome was degraded selectively. Both the pgACC and OFC 
lesion groups were insensitive to the contingency degradation, whereas the
control group demonstrated selectively higher performance of the nondegraded
action when compared with the degraded action. These findings suggest the pgACC
and OFC are both necessary for normal contingency learning and therefore
goal-directed behavior.

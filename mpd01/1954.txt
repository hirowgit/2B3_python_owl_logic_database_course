Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) are the most commonly used feeder cells for
pluripotent stem cells. However, autogeneic feeder (AF) cells have several
advantages such as no xenogeneic risks and reduced costs. In this report, we
demonstrate that common marmoset embryonic stem (cmES) cells can be maintained on
common marmoset AF (cmAF) cells. These cmES cells were maintained on cmAF cells
for 6 months, retaining their morphology, normal karyotype, and expression
patterns for the pluripotent markers Oct-3/4, Nanog, SSEA-3, SSEA-4, TRA-1-60,
and TRA-1-81, as well as their ability to differentiate into cardiac and neural
cells. Antibody array analysis revealed equivalent protein expression profiles
between cmES cells maintained on cmAF cells and MEFs. In addition, similarly
prepared human embryonic stem (hES) and induced pluripotent stem (hiPS)
cell-derived AF cells supported the growth of and maintained the morphology and
pluripotent marker expressions of hES and hiPS cells, respectively. DNA
microarray analysis revealed that these hES and hiPS cells had mRNA expression
profiles similar to those of hES and hiPS cells maintained on MEFs, respectively.
Taken together, these findings imply that AF cells can replace MEFs in the
routine maintenance of primate pluripotent stem cells.

Adult neurogenesis within the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the hippocampal dentate
gyrus and the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricle (LV) has been
most intensely studied within the brains of rodents such as mice and rats.
However, little is known about the cell types and processes involved in adult
neurogenesis within primates such as the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).
Moreover, substantial differences seem to exist between the neurogenic niche of
the LV between rodents and humans. Here, we set out to use immunohistochemical
and autogradiographic analysis to characterize the anatomy of the neurogenic
niches and the expression of cell type-specific markers in those niches in the
adult common marmoset brain. Moreover, we demonstrate significant differences in 
the activity of neurogenesis in the adult marmoset brain compared to the adult
mouse brain. Finally, we provide evidence for ongoing proliferation of
neuroblasts within both the SGZ and SVZ of the adult brain and further show that 
the age-dependent decline of neurogenesis in the hippocampus is associated with a
decrease in neuroblast cells.

The use of Rhodamin B for the identification of injected horseradish peroxidase
in the brain.

Schwerdtfeger WK.

Horseradish peroxidase injected into the brain of the marmoset, Callithrix
jacchus, is demonstrated by fluorescence microscopy following histochemical
reaction with homovanillic acid and Rhodamin B. Usefulness and efficiency of the 
method are discussed in comparison with other procedures for the demonstration of
HRP.

The retino-geniculo-cortical pathway in Callithrix. I. Intraspecific variations
in the lamination pattern of the lateral geniculate nucleus.

Spatz WB.

Injections of tritiated tracer precursors into one eye revealed a highly variable
lamination pattern of the LGN in the marmoset Callithrix. In one specimen, only
four cell layers were apparent with some indication of further differentiation.
In a second specimen, six almost complete relay layers were found in the
occipital portion of the LGN. Three other animals showed stages between these two
extremes. The lamination pattern of Callithrix thun represents an intermediate
stage between a four-layered LGN suggested as the basic primate pattern, and the 
advanced six-layered LGN of most other anthropoid monkeys. In addition, bilateral
retinal terminations were found consistently in layer 0, and contralateral
terminations in a narrow band between the magnocellular and parvocellular
portions of the nucleus, and within the interlaminar zone which separates the two
magnocellular layers.

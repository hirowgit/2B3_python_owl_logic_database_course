Genetically modified nonhuman primates (NHP) are useful models for biomedical
research. Gene editing technologies have enabled production of target-gene
knock-out (KO) NHP models. Target-gene-KO/knock-in (KI) efficiency of CRISPR/Cas9
has not been extensively investigated in marmosets. In this study, optimum
conditions for target gene modification efficacies of CRISPR/mRNA and
CRISPR/nuclease in marmoset embryos were examined. CRISPR/nuclease was more
effective than CRISPR/mRNA in avoiding mosaic genetic alteration. Furthermore,
optimal conditions to generate KI marmoset embryos were investigated using
CRISPR/Cas9 and 2 different lengths (36 nt and 100 nt) each of a sense or
anti-sense single-strand oligonucleotide (ssODN). KIs were observed when
CRISPR/nuclease and 36 nt sense or anti-sense ssODNs were injected into embryos. 
All embryos exhibited mosaic mutations with KI and KO, or imprecise KI, of c-kit.
Although further improvement of KI strategies is required, these results
indicated that CRISPR/Cas9 may be utilized to produce KO/KI marmosets via gene
editing.

Pyrrole-imidazole (PI) polyamides are novel gene silencers that strongly bind the
promoter region of target genes in a sequence-specific manner to inhibit gene
transcription. We created a PI polyamide targeting human TGF-β1 (hTGF-β1). To
develop this PI polyamide targeting hTGF-β1 (Polyamide) as a practical medicine
for treating progressive renal diseases, we examined the effects of Polyamide in 
two common marmoset models of nephropathy. We performed lead optimization of PI
polyamides that targeted hTGF-β1 by inhibiting in a dose-dependent manner the
expression of TGF-β1 mRNA stimulated by PMA in marmoset fibroblasts. Marmosets
were housed and fed with a 0.05% NaCl and magnesium diet and treated with
cyclosporine A (CsA; 37.5 mg/kg/day, eight weeks) to establish chronic
nephropathy. We treated the marmosets with nephropathy with Polyamide (1
mg/kg/week, four weeks). We also established a unilateral urethral obstruction
(UUO) model to examine the effects of Polyamide (1 mg/kg/week, four times) in
marmosets. Histologically, the renal medulla from CsA-treated marmosets showed
cast formation and interstitial fibrosis in the renal medulla.
Immunohistochemistry showed strong staining of Polyamide in the renal medulla
from CsA-treated marmosets. Polyamide treatment (1 mg/kg/week, four times)
reduced hTGF-β1 staining and urinary protein excretion in CsA-treated marmosets. 
In UUO kidneys from marmosets, Polyamide reduced the glomerular injury score and 
tubulointerstitial injury score. Polyamide significantly suppressed hTGF-β1 and
snail mRNA expression in UUO kidneys from the marmosets. Polyamide effectively
improved CsA- and UUO-associated nephropathy, indicating its potential
application in the prevention of renal fibrosis in progressive renal diseases.

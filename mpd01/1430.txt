BACKGROUND: The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is of interest for
reproductive studies because of their high and variable fertility in captivity.
However, to understand this variability, much basic information still needs to be
gathered. This study is the first to characterize marmoset semen comparing a
German and a Brazilian colony.
METHODS: All animals were weighted, and semen samples were collected by penile
vibratory stimulation and analyzed according to standard criteria.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The German animals had a higher mean and maximum weight 
than the Brazilian. Further, sperm concentration tended to be higher with heavier
animals in the German population, but not in the Brazilian. Additionally, major
defects tended to be more frequent with higher weight but also only in German
sample. In spite of these differences, the total range and variability in sperm
concentration were similar in both populations, suggesting that this is
characteristic for the species.

Accurate sound localization is based on three acoustic cues (interaural time and 
intensity difference and spectral cues from directional filtering by the pinna). 
In natural listening conditions, every spatial position of a sound source
provides a unique combination of these three cues in "natural alignment."
Although neurons in the central nucleus (ICC) of the inferior colliculus (IC) are
sensitive to multiple cues, they do not favor their natural spatial alignment. We
tested for sensitivity to cue alignment in the nucleus of the brachium of the IC 
(BIN) in unanesthetized marmoset monkeys. The BIN receives its predominant
auditory input from ICC and projects to the topographic auditory space map in the
superior colliculus. Sound localization cues measured in each monkey were used to
synthesize broadband stimuli with aligned and misaligned cues; spike responses to
these stimuli were recorded in the BIN. We computed mutual information (MI)
between the set of spike rates and the stimuli containing either aligned or
misaligned cues. The results can be summarized as follows: 1) BIN neurons encode 
more information about auditory space when cues are aligned compared with
misaligned. 2) Significantly more units prefer aligned cues in the BIN than in
ICC. 3) An additive model based on summing the responses to stimuli with the
localization cues varying individually accurately predicts the alignment
preference with all cues varying. Overall, the results suggest that the BIN is
the first site in the ascending mammalian auditory system that is tuned to
natural combinations of sound localization cues.

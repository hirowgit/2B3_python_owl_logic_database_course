The tumor suppressor p53 activates the transcription of human PIG3 through direct
interaction with a polymorphic microsatellite sequence, (TGYCC)(n). Here, the
evolution of this p53-responsive element was recapitulated. Comparison between
primate species revealed that the PIG3 promoter acquired this sequence element in
its full length only in Hominoidea (apes and humans), whereas the number of TGYCC
repeats is far lower in monkeys. Accordingly, only the PIG3 promoters from
Hominoidea respond efficiently to p53, whereas those from monkeys respond poorly 
or not at all. In parallel, the PIG3 gene was strongly induced by p53 in human
and chimpanzee cells but was unaffected by p53 in cells derived from a common
marmoset monkey. Thus, a novel p53 target gene appeared as recently as during the
evolution of primates. This suggests that mechanisms of tumor suppression are
subject to ongoing evolution in humans and their closest relatives.

Stress-related disorders such as depression and anxiety are characterized by
enhanced negative emotion and physiological dysfunction. Whilst elevated activity
within area 25 of the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC/25) has been
implicated in these illnesses, it is unknown whether this over-activity is
causal. By combining targeted intracerebral microinfusions with cardiovascular
and behavioral monitoring in marmosets, we show that over-activation of sgACC/25 
reduces vagal tone and heart rate variability, alters cortisol dynamics during
stress and heightens reactivity to proximal and distal threat. 18F-FDG PET
imaging shows these changes are accompanied by altered activity within a network 
of brain regions including the amygdala, hypothalamus and dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex. Ketamine, shown to have rapid antidepressant effects, fails to reverse
elevated arousal to distal threat contrary to the beneficial effects we have
previously demonstrated on over-activation induced reward blunting, illustrating 
the symptom-specificity of its actions.

Understanding the similarity of cortico-subcortical networks topologies between
humans and nonhuman primate species is critical to study the origin of network
alternations underlying human neurologic and neuropsychiatric diseases. The New
World common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) has become popular as a nonhuman
primate model for human brain function. Most marmoset connectomic research,
however, has exclusively focused on cortical areas, with connectivity to
subcortical networks less extensively explored. Here, we aimed to first isolate
patterns of subcortical connectivity with cortical resting-state networks in
awake marmosets using resting-state fMRI, then to compare these networks with
those in humans using connectivity fingerprinting. In this study, we used 5
marmosets (4 males, 1 female). While we could match several marmoset and human
resting-state networks based on their functional fingerprints, we also found a
few striking differences, for example, strong functional connectivity of the
default mode network with the superior colliculus in marmosets that was much
weaker in humans. Together, these findings demonstrate that many of the core
cortico-subcortical networks in humans are also present in marmosets, but that
small, potentially functionally relevant differences exist.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT
The common marmoset is becoming increasingly popular as an additional preclinical
nonhuman primate model for human brain function. Here we compared the functional 
organization of cortico-subcortical networks in marmosets and humans using
ultra-high field fMRI. We isolated the patterns of subcortical connectivity with 
cortical resting-state networks (RSNs) in awake marmosets using resting-state
fMRI and then compared these networks with those in humans using connectivity
fingerprinting. While we could match several marmoset and human RSNs based on
their functional fingerprints, we also found several striking differences.
Together, these findings demonstrate that many of the core cortico-subcortical
RSNs in humans are also present in marmosets, but that small, potentially
functionally relevant differences exist.

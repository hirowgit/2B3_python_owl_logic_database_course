Cocaine addiction is a severe psychiatric condition for which currently no
effective pharmacotherapy is available. Brain mechanisms for the establishment of
addiction-related behaviors are still not fully understood, and specific
biomarkers for cocaine use are not available. Sphingolipids are major membrane
lipids, which shape neuronal membrane composition and dynamics in the brain.
Here, we investigated how chronic cocaine exposure during establishment of
addiction-related behaviors affects the activity of the sphingolipid rheostat
controlling enzymes in the brain of rats. As we detected specific effects on
several enzymes in the brain, we tested whether the activity of selected enzymes 
in the blood may serve as potential biomarker for cocaine exposure in non-human
primates (Callithrix penicillata). We found that intravenous cocaine
self-administration led to a reduced mRNA expression of Cers1, Degs1 and Degs2,
and Smpd1 in the prefrontal cortex of rats, as well as a reduction of Cers4
expression in the striatum. These effects reversed after 10 days of abstinence.
Monkeys showed a robust cocaine-induced place preference (CPP). This coincided
with a reduction in blood acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) activity after CPP
establishment. This effect normalized after 15 days of abstinence. Altogether,
these findings suggest that the establishment of cocaine addiction-related
behaviors coincides with changes in the activity of sphingolipid controlling
enzymes. In particular, blood ASM levels may serve as a translational biomarker
for recent cocaine exposure.

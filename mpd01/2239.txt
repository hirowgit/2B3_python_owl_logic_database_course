A single injection of ML29 reassortant vaccine for Lassa fever induces low,
transient viremia, and low or moderate levels of ML29 replication in tissues of
common marmosets depending on the dose of the vaccination. The vaccination
elicits specific immune responses and completely protects marmosets against fatal
disease by induction of sterilizing cell-mediated immunity. DNA array analysis of
human peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors exposed to ML29
revealed that gene expression patterns in ML29-exposed PBMC and control,
media-exposed PBMC, clustered together confirming safety profile of the ML29 in
non-human primates. The ML29 reassortant is a promising vaccine candidate for
Lassa fever.

An impairment in learning to inhibit prepotent responses to positive stimuli is
associated with damage to the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) in rats, monkeys, and
humans performing discrimination reversal, extinction, and detour reaching tasks.
In contrast, a recent study showed that OFC-lesioned rhesus monkeys could learn
to select the smaller of 2 quantities of food reward in order to receive the
larger reward, at an equivalent rate to controls, despite the requirement to
inhibit a prepotent response. Given this result, the aim of the present study was
to further specify the contexts under which the OFC regulates responding and to
identify additional components of limbic circuitry that contribute to such
regulation. Marmosets with lesions of the OFC and medial striatum (MS), but not
the amygdala, made more prepotent responses to a clear Perspex box containing
high incentive food before learning to choose the box containing low incentive
food, to obtain reward. However, having learned the incongruent incentive
discrimination OFC- and MS-lesioned monkeys were impaired upon reversal of the
reward contingencies, repeatedly selecting the previously rewarded low incentive 
object. These findings identify the critical contribution of the OFC and MS in
the regulation of responding by affective cues.

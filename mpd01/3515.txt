Two human monoclonal antibodies (HuMAbs) with widely different HLA specificities 
were raised from a uniparous HLA-seropositive female. Screening against a large
panel of serologically HLA-typed lymphocytes in the complement-dependent
cytotoxicity test showed that one of these HuMAbs, VP6G3, was specific for
HLA-Cw1, thereby constituting the first HuMAb against an HLA-C locus product. The
second HuMAb, VP5G3, was directed against an HLA-A-encoded determinant shared by 
HLA-A11, -A25, -A26 and -A66. The epitopes responsible for binding were
determined by comparing the aminoacid sequences and were pinpointed to the 6K/9F 
combination for HuMAb VP6G3, and 163R with a critical contribution of aminoacids 
present at positions 166/167 for HuMAb VP5G3.

The objectives of this study were (a) to establish a population pharmacokinetic
model and (b) to investigate the clinical and physiological effects of a single
bolus dose of propofol in common marmosets. In Study 1, pharmacokinetic analysis 
was performed in six marmosets under sevoflurane anaesthesia. 8 mg/kg of propofol
was administrated at a rate of 4 mg kg-1  min-1 . Blood samples were collected 2,
5, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120 or 180 min after starting propofol administration. Plasma 
concentration was measured, and population pharmacokinetic modelling was
performed. A two-compartment model was selected as the final model. The
population pharmacokinetic parameters were as follows: V1  = 1.14 L, V2  = 77.6
L, CL1  = 0.00182 L/min, CL2  = 0.0461 L/min. In Study 2, clinical and
physiological parameters were assessed and recorded every 2 min after 12 mg/kg of
propofol was administrated at a rate of 4 mg kg-1  min-1 . Immobilization was
sustained for 5 min following propofol administration without apparent
bradycardia. While combination of propofol and sevoflurane caused apnoea in Study
1, apnoea was not observed following single administration of propofol in Study
2. These data provide bases for further investigation on intravenous anaesthesia 
using propofol in common marmosets.

The pulvinar, the largest thalamic nucleus in the primate brain, has connections 
with a variety of cortical areas and is involved in many aspects of higher brain 
functions. Among cortico-pulvino-cortical systems, the connection between the
middle temporal area (MT) and the pulvinar has been thought to contribute
significantly to complex motion recognition. Recently, the common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus), has become a valuable model for a variety of neuroscience
studies, including visual neuroscience and translational research of neurological
and psychiatric disorders. However, information on projections from MT to the
pulvinar in the marmoset brain is scant. We addressed this deficiency by
injecting sensitive anterograde viral tracers into MT to examine the distribution
of labeled terminations in the pulvinar. The injection sites were placed
retinotopically according to visual field coordinates mapped by optical intrinsic
imaging. All injections produced anterograde terminal labeling, which was densest
in the medial nucleus of the inferior pulvinar (PIm), sparser in the central
nucleus of the inferior pulvinar, and weakest in the lateral pulvinar. Within
each subnucleus, terminations formed separate retinotopic fields. Most labeled
terminals were small but these comingled with a few large terminals, distributed 
mainly in the dorsomedial part of the PIm. Our results further delineate the
organization of projections from MT to the pulvinar in the marmoset as forming
parallel complex networks, which may differentially contribute to motion
processing. It is interesting that the densest projections from MT target the
PIm, the subnucleus recently reported to preferentially receive direct retinal
projections.

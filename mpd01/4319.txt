While distal influences acting both tropically and trophically upon regenerating 
nerve fibres are not in doubt, the specificity of such influences is unresolved. 
The present experiments were designed to test whether pioneering axons
regenerating through a large muscle graft showed specificity for their homonymous
distal stumps if faced with a choice of pathways. Regeneration was assessed with 
respect to nerve conduction, the electromyograph, isometric tension and
morphological indices of nerve regeneration in the median and ulnar nerves of
non-human primates. Reinnervation of both distal stumps with functional
neuromuscular transmission was found to take place by growth of nerve fibres from
either proximal nerve into either distal stump. There was thus no evidence of
specific homonymous reinnervation. The implications of this finding are discussed
from a mechanistic and a clinical point of view.

The present report documents the breeding success of a new colony of common
marmosets (Callithrix jacchus jacchus) and demonstrates a correlation between
environmental stress and reproductive success. Environmental conditions ranged
chronologically over 40 months, through four periods: I) the initial period, when
the colony was formed; II) a phase of relative environmental stability; III) a
stage of "environmental stress" (when the colony was disrupted by nearby
construction); and IV) a return to a stable environment. Examination of
reproductive status during each period indicated that the colony exhibited severe
reproductive suppression during the time of the environmental disruption. Parity 
and the number of live births decreased and the number of spontaneous abortions
increased during this period. Reproductive success remained low during period IV.
More triplets than twins were born during the period of relative environmental
stability.

Currently, little information is available for major histocompatibility complex
(MHC)-I that conditions the T-cell response of marmosets. In this study, 471
clones of MHC-I cDNA sequences were isolated from 12 marmosets. Twenty
full-length sequences of class I G (Caja-G) alleles were obtained from these
marmosets, 15 of them were novel. Among these 20 Caja-G alleles, 10 were found in
individual animals while the rests were in two to four marmosets, but none was
common to all animals. Ten marmosets possessed one to three Caja-G alleles, and
two marmosets carried five or six alleles, which suggested that the Caja-G locus 
was duplicated in marmoset's genome. The high polymorphisms of Caja-G sequences
provided important information helpful for understanding the cellular immune
response in virus-infected marmosets.

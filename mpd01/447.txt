We proposed a generic template-derived approach for (semi-) automated brain
extraction in animal MRI studies and evaluated our implementation with different 
animal models (macaque, marmoset, rodent) and MRI protocols (T1, T2). While
conventional MR-neuroimaging studies perform brain extraction as an initial step 
priming subsequent image-registration from subject to template, our proposed
approach propagates an anatomical template to (whole-head) individual subjects in
reverse order, which is challenging due to the surrounding extracranial tissue,
greater differences in contrast pattern and larger areas with field
inhomogeneity. As a novel approach, the herein introduced brain extraction
algorithm derives whole-brain segmentation using rigid and non-rigid deformation 
based on unbiased anatomical atlas building with a priori estimates from
study-cohort and an initial approximate brain extraction. We evaluated our
proposed method in comparison to several other technical approaches including
"Marker based watershed scalper", "Brain-Extraction-Tool", "3dSkullStrip",
"Primatologist-Toolbox", "Rapid Automatic Tissue Segmentation" and "Robust
automatic rodent brain extraction using 3D pulse-coupled neural networks" with
manual skull-stripping as reference standard. ABX demonstrated best performance
with accurate (≥92%) and consistent results throughout datasets and across
species, age and MRI protocols. ABX was made available to the public with
documentation, templates and sample material (

Preexisting neutralizing antibody (NAb) against human adenovirus serotype 5
(AdHu5) can reduce the immunogenicity of AdHu5 vector-based vaccine, thus
inhibiting the host's immune response and utility of other homologous vectors.
Common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a small new world primate, has attracted
considerable attention for its potential as a preclinical research model of
vaccine development. However, the prevalence of anti-AdHu5 NAb activity in common
marmosets bred in China remains unknown. A recombinant adenovirus expressing
luciferase and Zs Green reporter genes were constructed to detect NAb against
rAdHu5 by flow cytometry (FCM) and chemiluminescence (CL) assay. Five of 25
marmosets (20%) presented AdHu5 NAb detectable by FCM. Four animals had low titer
(1/16), while the fifth one reached 1/64. While by CL assay, 7 of 25 (28%)
marmosets were anti-AdHu5 NAb positive. Four animals, two of whom were negative
by FCM, also had low titer NAb (1/16), suggesting assay discrepancy at low
levels. Two marmosets, 1/32 titer by CL, were at 1/16 by FCM. A single animal
showed a high titer with both assays (1/128 and 1/64 by CL and FCM,
respectively). The CL method was simpler, more sensitive, accurate, and stable.
The low prevalence of preexisting anti-AdHu5 NAb in marmosets provides important 
background information on the feasibility and applicability of using marmosets as
a preclinical research model for vaccine development.

Neural stem cells (NSCs) are multipotent and self-renewing precursor cells that
give rise to all cell types of the central nervous system (CNS). They can be used
for modeling CNS in vitro, for developmental studies and for cell replacement
therapies. NSCs can be derived from pluripotent stem cells through
differentiation using specific growth factors. Nonhuman primates (NHP) are
critical preclinical models for translational research. Induced pluripotent stem 
cells (iPSCs) can be generated from NHP for the purposes of allogenic or
autologous cell replacement studies. Here, we describe the derivation of NSCs
from NHP iPSCs.

The directed differentiation of pluripotent stem cells to a desired lineage often
involves complex and lengthy protocols. In order to study the requirements for
differentiation in a systematic way, we present here methodology for an iterative
approach using combinations of small molecules and biological factors. The
factors are used in a cyclical process in which the best combination of factors
and concentrations is selected in one round of testing, followed by a
modification of the combination and subsequent rounds. While this may produce the
desired differentiation in the cell population under study, it is also possible
that other strategies may be needed to optimize the differentiation process.
These strategies are described in this chapter.

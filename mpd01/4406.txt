Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:5 n-3; ethyl ester) in combination with
atherogenic or non-atherogenic high fat diets was fed to young adult male
marmoset monkeys for a period of 30 weeks. EPA markedly reduced the raised plasma
cholesterol level evident when feeding an atherogenic diet but did not influence 
the cardiac membrane cholesterol-to-phospholipid ratio. EPA and its elongation
product 22:5 n-3 was incorporated into cardiac membrane phospholipids at the
expense of linoleic and arachidonic acids. Dietary EPA increased cardiac beta-AR 
affinity and reversed the decreased beta-AR affinity evident when feeding an
atherogenic diet.

Hematologic and immunologic responses in common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus)
infected with Plasmodium knowlesi and Epstein-Barr virus.

Felton SC, Hoffmann CC, Kreier JP, Glaser R.

The hematologic and immunologic responses to infection with either the
Epstein-Barr virus alone or infection with Epstein-Barr virus and Plasmodium
knowlesi were studied using common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus). The assays
performed included complete blood cell counts, determinations of natural killer
cell activity, and determinations of antibody titers to Epstein-Barr virus early 
antigen, virus capsid antigen and the nuclear antigen. While no animal showed
signs of lymphoproliferative disease, it was found that animals infected with
Epstein-Barr virus became positive for early antigen, virus capsid antigen and
nuclear antigen at low levels. No difference in antibody titers between
Epstein-Barr virus infected animals and co-infected animals was observed. An
increase also was found in the number of leukocytes in all groups, and an
increase in natural killer cells following infection with Epstein-Barr virus.
Some depression in natural killer cells was observed in the co-infected animals
when compared to Epstein-Barr virus infected animals.

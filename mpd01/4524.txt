Suboccipital puncture for cerebrospinal fluid in the common marmoset (Callithrix 
jacchus).

Geretschl√§ger E, Russ H, Mihatsch W, Przuntek H.

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) can be obtained routinely from the common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus) by suboccipital puncture. One field of research in which
this method is applied is the detection of changes in the biogenic amine
metabolism in CSF. The puncture technique is simple and rapid and does not injure
the experimental animal.

Elevated urinary excretion of beta-aminoisobutyric acid and exposure to inorganic
lead.

Farkas WR, Fischbein A, Solomon S, Buschman F, Borek E, Sharma OK.

beta-Aminoisobutyric acid (beta-AIB), a normal degradation product of thymine, a 
constituent of DNA and, to a lesser extent, of transfer RNA, is excreted in low
levels in human urine. We found that a group of iron workers occupationally
exposed to inorganic lead excreted high levels of urinary beta-AIB. Elevated
urinary excretion of beta-AIB was also observed in marmosets, Callithrix jacchus,
that received lead acetate in drinking water. Our results suggest that increased 
urinary excretion of beta-AIB could stem from damage to DNA on exposure to lead.

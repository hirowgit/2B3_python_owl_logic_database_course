PURPOSE: To evaluate the retinal penetration and toxicity of two doses of
intravitreal infliximab in primates.
METHODS: Ten marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) were given intravitreal injection of 
100 μg or 400 μg of infliximab, and balanced salt solution served as control. At 
baseline and after 24 hours (5 animals) and 7 days (the other 5), the eyes were
examined by electroretinography. They were then killed (at 24 hours and 7 days)
and assessed by light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy for
toxicity and immunohistochemistry, using a biotinylated anti-human immunoglobulin
G, to evaluate retinal penetration.
RESULTS: There was no difference over 50% of the electroretinography b-wave
between baseline and the time points studied in all animals. Light and electron
microscopy, and electroretinography analysis, showed no signs of toxicity in any 
of the animals. Strong presence of infliximab was observed in all retinal layers 
7 days after intravitreal injection at both doses (100 and 400 μg).
CONCLUSION: Infliximab at doses of 100 and 400 μg seemed to cause no damage to
the retina 24 hours and 7 days after its intravitreal injection, and deeply
penetrated all its layers, in primates. These results encourage future
perspectives for the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases of the retina in 
humans.

BACKGROUND: Current knowledge about the optimal energy and nutrient supply for
common marmoset monkeys (Callithrix jacchus) is scarce, and more information is
needed for establishing the underlying nutritional concepts for facilitating
longevity of this species as laboratory animals for biomedical research.
METHODS: Two feeding experiments were conducted to yield fundamental data about
feed acceptance, real feed intake, and feed preferences under laboratory
conditions. Newly developed feeding concepts for marmoset monkeys were also
examined in preliminary investigations to compare the outcomes with those of a
commercial pelletized mixed feed.
RESULTS: The first experiments showed preferences for main protein sources in the
diets studied, specifically that plant proteins are more accepted than fish meal 
or egg protein as the main protein source. Several aroma supplements did not
modify the acceptance and feed intake markedly.
CONCLUSIONS: The newly developed feeding concept yielded promising preliminary
data for long-term studies of energy and nutrient supply under laboratory
conditions. However, studies of the fundamental requirements are still needed.

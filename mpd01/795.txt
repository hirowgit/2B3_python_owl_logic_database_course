Increasing evidence suggests that personality structure differs between species, 
but the evolutionary reasons for this variation are not fully understood. We
built on earlier research on New World monkeys to further elucidate the evolution
of personality structure in primates. We therefore examined personality in 100
family-reared adult common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) from 3 colonies on a
60-item questionnaire. Principal components analyses revealed 5 domains that were
largely similar to those found in a previous study on captive, ex-pet, or
formerly laboratory-housed marmosets that were housed in a sanctuary. The
interrater reliabilities of domain scores were consistent with the interrater
reliabilities of domain scores found in other species, including humans. Four
domainsdmdash;conscientiousness, agreeableness, inquisitiveness, and
assertiveness-resembled personality domains identified in other nonhuman
primates. The remaining domain, patience, was specific to common marmosets. We
used linear models to test for sex and age differences in the personality
domains. Males were lower than females in patience, and this difference was
smaller in older marmosets. Older marmosets were lower in inquisitiveness.
Finally, older males and younger females had higher scores in agreeableness than 
younger males and older females. These findings suggest that cooperative breeding
may have promoted the evolution of social cognition and influenced the structure 
of marmoset prosocial personality characteristics. (PsycINFO Database Record

The modulation of ion channel activity by lipids is increasingly recognized as a 
fundamental component of cellular signalling. The transient receptor potential
mucolipin (TRPML) channel family belongs to the TRP superfamily and is composed
of three members: TRPML1-TRPML3. TRPMLs are the major Ca2+-permeable channels on 
late endosomes and lysosomes (LEL). They regulate the release of Ca2+ from
organelles, which is important for various physiological processes, including
organelle trafficking and fusion. Loss-of-function mutations in the MCOLN1 gene, 
which encodes TRPML1, cause the neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorder
mucolipidosis type IV, and a gain-of-function mutation (Ala419Pro) in TRPML3
gives rise to the varitint-waddler (Va) mouse phenotype. Notably, TRPML channels 
are activated by the low-abundance and LEL-enriched signalling lipid
phosphatidylinositol-3,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,5)P2), whereas other
phosphoinositides such as PtdIns(4,5)P2, which is enriched in plasma membranes,
inhibit TRPMLs. Conserved basic residues at the N terminus of the channel are
important for activation by PtdIns(3,5)P2 and inhibition by PtdIns(4,5)P2.
However, owing to a lack of structural information, the mechanism by which TRPML 
channels recognize PtdIns(3,5)P2 and increase their Ca2+ conductance remains
unclear. Here we present the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of a
full-length TRPML3 channel from the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) at an
overall resolution of 2.9 Å. Our structure reveals not only the molecular basis
of ion conduction but also the unique architecture of TRPMLs, wherein the voltage
sensor-like domain is linked to the pore via a cytosolic domain that we term the 
mucolipin domain. Combined with functional studies, these data suggest that the
mucolipin domain is responsible for PtdIns(3,5)P2 binding and subsequent channel 
activation, and that it acts as a 'gating pulley' for lipid-dependent TRPML
gating.

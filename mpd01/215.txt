GPR56, a member of the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor family, is abundantly 
expressed in cells of the developing cerebral cortex, including neural progenitor
cells and developing neurons. The human GPR56 gene has multiple presumptive
promoters that drive the expression of the GPR56 protein in distinct patterns.
Similar to coding mutations of the human GPR56 gene that may cause GPR56
dysfunction, a 15-bp homozygous deletion in the cis-regulatory element upstream
of the noncoding exon 1 of GPR56 (e1m) leads to the cerebral cortex malformation 
and epilepsy. To clarify the expression profile of the e1m promoter-driven GPR56 
in primate brain, we generated a transgenic marmoset line in which EGFP is
expressed under the control of the human minimal e1m promoter. In contrast to the
endogenous GPR56 protein, which is highly enriched in the ventricular zone of the
cerebral cortex, EGFP is mostly expressed in developing neurons in the transgenic
fetal brain. Furthermore, EGFP is predominantly expressed in GABAergic neurons,
whereas the total GPR56 protein is evenly expressed in both GABAergic and
glutamatergic neurons, suggesting the GABAergic neuron-preferential activity of
the minimal e1m promoter. These results indicate a possible pathogenic role for
GABAergic neuron in the cerebral cortex of patients with GPR56 mutations.

BACKGROUND: Anhedonia, the loss of pleasure in previously rewarding activities,
is a prominent feature of major depressive disorder and often resistant to
first-line antidepressant treatment. A paucity of translatable cross-species
tasks to assess subdomains of anhedonia, including reward learning, presents a
major obstacle to the development of effective therapeutics. One assay of reward 
learning characterized by orderly behavioral and pharmacological findings in both
humans and rats is the probabilistic reward task. In this computerized task,
subjects make discriminations across numerous trials in which correct responses
to one alternative are rewarded more often (rich) than correct responses to the
other (lean). Healthy control subjects reliably develop a response bias to the
rich alternative. However, participants with major depressive disorder as well as
rats exposed to chronic stress typically exhibit a blunted response bias.
METHODS: The present studies validated a touchscreen-based probabilistic reward
task for the marmoset, a small nonhuman primate with considerable translational
value. First, probabilistic reinforcement contingencies were parametrically
examined. Next, the effects of ketamine (1.0-10.0 mg/kg), a US Food and Drug
Administration-approved rapid-acting antidepressant, and phencyclidine (0.01-0.1 
mg/kg), a pharmacologically similar N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist with
no known antidepressant efficacy, were evaluated.
RESULTS: Increases in the asymmetry of rich:lean probabilistic contingencies
produced orderly increases in response bias. Consistent with their respective
clinical profiles, ketamine but not phencyclidine produced dose-related increases
in response bias at doses that did not reduce task discriminability.
CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these findings confirm task and pharmacological
sensitivity in the marmoset, which may be useful in developing medications to
counter anhedonia across neuropsychiatric disorders.

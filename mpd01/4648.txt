Diurnal and annual variations in plasma androgen levels in the adult male
marmoset (callithrix jacchus).

Kholkute SD.

Diurnal and annual variations in plasma androgen levels were studied in adult
male marmosets. A distinct diurnal pattern, characterized by low androgen levels 
during the lights-on period and high levels during the lights-off period was
observed (n = 7). In contrast to this, no definite circannual pattern in androgen
levels was observed (n = 6).

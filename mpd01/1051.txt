BACKGROUND: The increasing life span of Callithrix jacchus in combination with
the occurrence of metabolic and age-dependent diseases requires improved health
surveillance for this species.
METHODS: The health status of 56 marmosets was studied using a non-invasive blood
pressure (BP) device. Age-, weight-, and sex-dependent changes were analyzed.
Four animals with striking BP findings had follow-up exams.
RESULTS: Physiological and pathological BP values could be defined. BP positively
correlated with age and weight, while no effect of sex could be found.
Measurement time for female and older animals was shorter than for male and
younger individuals. Further analysis of the suspicious patients revealed renal
or hepatic diseases and cardiac alterations.
CONCLUSION: The description of age and weight influences on BP delivers
physiological and pathological values for common marmosets. This may contribute
to the understanding of aging process and cardiology in this primate species.

BACKGROUND: The D1/D2 dopamine agonist apomorphine has poor oral bioavailability,
necessitating subcutaneous administration in the treatment of Parkinson's disease
(PD). Acute subcutaneous injection is used as rescue therapy from "off" periods, 
whereas continuous subcutaneous infusion is used to increase "on" periods and to 
reduce dyskinesia when oral treatment fails. An orally active derivative of
apomorphine would avoid the need for parenteral administration. We now describe
the effects of the orally active compound
R-(-)-11-O-valeryl-N-n-propylnoraporphine (11-OH-NPa valerate) on reversal of
motor disability and expression of dyskinesia in
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated, l-dopa-primed
dyskinetic common marmosets.
METHODS: Locomotor activity, motor disability, and dyskinesia were assessed in
MPTP-treated marmosets following the administration of apomorphine (0.075 mg/kg, 
subcutaneous and 0.28 to 1.12 mg/kg, oral) and 11-OH-NPa valerate (0.19, 0.38,
and 0.75mg/kg, oral).
RESULTS: Subcutaneous administration of apomorphine (0.075 mg/kg) produced a
short-lasting reversal of motor disability and the expression of established
dyskinesia, but when administered orally (0.28-1.12 mg/kg) it had no effect. In
contrast, oral treatment with 11-OH-NPa valerate (0.19 and 0.75 mg/kg) induced a 
dose-related reversal of motor disability and increased locomotor activity with
only mild to moderate dyskinesia. Only at the highest dose (0.75 mg/kg) was
marked dyskinesia seen accompanying an extended period of motor disability
reversal and increased locomotor activity.
CONCLUSION: Oral administration of 11-OH-NPa valerate produced a rapid reversal
of motor disability and, at effective dose levels, had a limited propensity to
induce dyskinesia. 11-OH-NPa valerate is the first orally active derivative of
apomorphine with potential for use in PD. © 2016 International Parkinson and

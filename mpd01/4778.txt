Inhibition of ovarian function in subordinate female marmoset monkeys (Callithrix
jacchus jacchus).

Abbott DH, McNeilly AS, Lunn SF, Hulme MJ, Burden FJ.

Plasma concentrations of progesterone, cortisol, LH and prolactin were measured
in dominant and subordinate female marmosets in 10 well-established peer groups. 
Subordinate females never ovulated, had a reduced LH response to LH-RH and showed
no positive feedback LH surge after oestrogen administration. There was no
evidence of elevated plasma cortisol levels or hyperprolactinaemia in
subordinates and all showed a similar prolactin response to TRH in comparison
with dominants. However, subordinates showed a reduced prolactin response to
metoclopramide. These results clearly indicate that high circulating levels of
cortisol or prolactin are not responsible for the inhibition of ovulation in
female marmosets.

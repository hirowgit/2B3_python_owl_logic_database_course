Baseline locomotion and behavioral traits in the common marmoset Parkinson's
disease model were examined to provide basic information for preclinical
evaluations of medical treatments. A single regimen of
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine at a cumulative dose of 5 mg/kg as
the free base over three consecutive days was administered subcutaneously to 10
marmosets. Data obtained from these marmosets were compared to
pre-1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine levels or
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine free marmosets. After the single
regimen, reduced daily locomotion, a measure of immobility (a primary sign of
Parkinsonism), was observed for more than a year. A moving tremor was also
observed by visual inspection during this period. When apomorphine (0.13 mg/kg,
s.c.) was administered, either right or left circling behavior was observed in a 
cylindrical chamber in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine marmosets,
suggestive of unequal neural damage between the two brain hemispheres to
different extents. MRI revealed that T1 relaxation time in the right substantia
nigra correlated with right circling in
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine marmosets. Histology was supportive 
of dopaminergic neural loss in the striatum. These results increase our
understanding of the utility and limitations of the Parkinson's disease model in 
marmosets with a single 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine regimen, and
provide reference data for efficacious preclinical evaluations.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a non-human primate that provides
valuable models for neuroscience and aging research due to its anatomical
similarities to humans and relatively short lifespan. This study was carried out 
to examine whether aged marmosets develop glaucoma, as seen in humans. We found
that 11% of the aged marmosets presented with glaucoma-like characteristics; this
incident rate is very similar to that in humans. Magnetic resonance imaging
showed a significant volume loss in the visual cortex, and histological analyses 
confirmed the degeneration of the lateral geniculate nuclei and visual cortex in 
the affected marmosets. These marmosets did not have elevated intraocular
pressure, but showed an increased oxidative stress level, low cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF) pressure, and low brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and TrkB
expression in the retina, optic nerve head and CSF. Our findings suggest that
marmosets have potential to provide useful information for the research of eye
and the visual system.

Centromeres usually contain large amounts of tandem repeat DNA. Alpha satellite
DNA (AS) is the most abundant tandem repeat DNA found in the centromeres of
simian primates. The AS of humans contains sequences organized into higher-order 
repeat (HOR) structures, which are tandem arrays of larger repeat units
consisting of multiple basic repeat units. HOR-carrying AS also occurs in other
hominoids, but results reported to date for phylogenetically more remote taxa
have been negative. Here we show direct evidence for clear HOR structures in AS
of the owl monkey and common marmoset. These monkeys are New World monkey species
that are located phylogenetically outside of hominoids. It is currently
postulated that the presence of HOR structures in AS is unique to hominoids. Our 
results suggest that this view must be modified. A plausible explanation is that 
generation of HOR structures is a general event that occurs occasionally or
frequently in primate centromeres, and that, in humans, HOR-carrying AS became
predominant in the central region of the centromere. It is often difficult to
assemble sequence reads of tandem repeat DNAs into accurate contig sequences; our
careful sequencing strategy allowed us to overcome this problem.

Transplantation of pig islet cells for the treatment of diabetes may be a more
effective approach compared with the application of insulin. However, before
introduction into the clinic, efficacy and safety of this treatment have to be
shown. Non-human primate models may be used for this, despite the fact that they 
are characterised by several limitations. Here we investigate the prevalence of
porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERVs), which are present in the genome of all
pigs and which may infect human cells, as well as of porcine herpes viruses in
donor pigs and their potential transmission to non-human primate recipients.
Despite the fact that all three subtypes of PERV were present in all and porcine 
cytomegalovirus (PCMV) was found in some of the pigs, neither PERVs nor PCMV were
found in the recipient animals under the experimental conditions applied. Porcine
lymphotropic herpes viruses (PLHV) were not found in the donor pigs, hepatitis E 
virus (HEV) was not found in the recipients.

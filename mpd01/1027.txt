Recent advances in genome editing have facilitated the generation of nonhuman
primate (NHP) models, with potential to unmask the complex biology of human
disease not revealed by rodent models. However, their broader use is hindered by 
the challenges associated with generation of adult NHP models as well as the cost
of their production. Here, we describe the generation of a marmoset model of
severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). This study optimized zinc-finger
nucleases (ZFNs) and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) to 
target interleukin-2 receptor subunit gamma (IL2RG) in pronuclear stage marmoset 
embryos. Nine of 21 neonates exhibited mutations in the IL2RG gene, concomitant
with immunodeficiency, and three neonates have currently survived from 240 days
to 1.8 years. Our approach demonstrates highly efficient production of founder
NHP with SCID phenotypes, with promises of multiple pre-clinical and
translational applications.

Much has been written about hepatic metastasis and animal models abound. In terms
of the human experience, progress in treating this final common pathway, a
terminal event of many human malignancies has been relatively slow. The current
thinking is that primary prevention is best served by early detection of cancer
and eradication of early stage cancers by screening. Some cancers spread early in
their course and the role of screening may be limited. Until relatively recently 
there has not been a pathfinder model that makes the evasion of this unfortunate 
event a reality. This review discusses such an animal model and attempts to
relate it to human disease in terms of intervention. Concrete proposals are also 
offered on how scientists may be able to intervene to prevent this deadly
progression of the cancer process.

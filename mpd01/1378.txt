We developed a combined conditional cytotoxic, i.e., herpes simplex type
1-thymidine kinase (TK), plus immune-stimulatory, i.e., fms-like tyrosine kinase 
ligand-3-mediated gene therapy for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Therapeutic
transgenes were encoded within high-capacity adenoviral vectors (HC-Ad); TK was
expressed constitutively, while Flt3L was under the control of the TetOn
regulatable promoter. We previously assessed efficacy and safety in intracranial 
GBM rodent models. But, since this approach involves expression of a cytokine
within the brain, we chose the nonhuman primate, i.e., Callithrix jaccus
(marmoset) as it has been established that its immune response shares
similarities with man. We characterized the safety, cell-type specific
expression, and doxycycline (DOX)-inducibility of HC-Ad-TetOn-Flt3L delivered
within the striatum. We used allometrically scaled DOX doses delivered orally,
twice daily for one month, mimicking the route and duration of DOX administration
planned for the GBM trial. Flt3L was effectively expressed within astrocytes,
microglia, oligodendrocytes, and neurons. No evidence of brain or systemic
toxicities due to the treatment was encountered. Our data indicate that DOX doses
equivalent to those used in humans to treat infections can be safely used
"off-label" to turn "on" therapeutic gene expression from HC-Ad-TetOn-Flt3L;
providing evidence for the safety of this approach in the clinic.

In the primate cerebral cortex, dendritic spines rapidly increase in number after
birth up to infancy or mid-childhood, and then decrease towards adulthood.
Abnormalities in these processes accompany several psychiatric disorders. In this
study, we examined developmental changes of basal dendrites and spines of layer
III pyramidal cells in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of the common
marmoset. The mPFC consists of several areas with distinct features in layer
organization, histochemistry, connections, and, in humans, vulnerability to
psychiatric disorders. We selected three areas for examination: granular
dorsomedial prefrontal (area 8B/9), dysgranular ventromedial prefrontal (area
14r), and agranular anterior cingulate (area 24) cortices. Dendritic field areas,
lengths, number of branching points, and total spine number reached a peak at 2-3
postnatal months in all three areas. However, the profiles of spine formation and
pruning differed across the three areas with different degrees of granularity;
the amount of spine loss from the peak to adulthood was less in areas 24 (33%)
and 14r (29%) than in area 8B/9 (43%). Disturbance of this modest spine pruning
in the less granular cortical areas may lead to an excessive loss of spines
reported for areas 24 and 14r of schizophrenic patients.

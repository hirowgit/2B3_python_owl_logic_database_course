The effects of metoclopramide, sulpiride, and the stereoisomers of baclofen on
amphetamine-induced behavior in the marmoset.

Ridley RM, Scraggs PR, Baker HF.

We have studied the effects on amphetamine-induced behavior in a primate species 
of drugs (other than the classic neuroleptics) sometimes used in the treatment of
psychosis. Marmosets were treated with either saline (control animals) or
amphetamine followed after 18 min by doses of either metoclopramide, sulpiride,
or the d- or l-isomers of baclofen. Metoclopramide antagonized
amphetamine-induced behavior at low doses while also causing sedation at higher
doses in control animals. Neither sulpiride nor baclofen specifically antagonized
amphetamine-induced behavior.

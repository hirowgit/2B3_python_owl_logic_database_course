Although the Atlantic Forest marmosets (Callithrix spp.) are among the best
studied Neotropical primates, the Amazonian marmosets (Callibella humilis,
Cebuella spp. and Mico spp.) are much less well-known. Even species diversity and
distributions are yet to be properly determined because field data and materials 
currently available in scientific collections do not allow comprehensive
taxonomic studies of Amazonian marmosets. From 2015 to 2018, we conducted 10
expeditions in key-areas within southern Amazonia where little or no information 
on marmosets was available. In one such region-the Tapajós-Jamanxim interfluve-we
recorded marmosets with a distinctive pelage pigmentation pattern suggesting they
could represent a new species. We tested this hypothesis using an integrative
taxonomic framework that included phylogenomic data (ddRAD sequences), pelage
pigmentation characters, and distribution records. We found that the marmosets of
the northern Tapajós-Jamanxim interfluve have unique states in pelage
pigmentation characters, form a clade (100% support) in our Bayesian and
Maximum-Likelihood phylogenies, and occur in an area isolated from other taxa by 
rivers. The integration of these lines of evidence leads us to describe a new
marmoset species in the genus Mico, named after the Munduruku Amerindians of the 
Tapajós-Jamanxim interfluve, southwest of Pará State, Brazil.

BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating and inflammatory disease
of the central nervous system. Its diagnosis is clinical, often confirmed by
magnetic resonance imaging. This image modality, however, is not ideal for
discrimination of demyelination in grey and white matter regions from
inflammatory lesions. Positron Emission Tomography (PET), using specific
radiopharmaceuticals, can be a tool to differentiate between these processes. The
radiopharmaceutical [11C]PIB is widely used for detection of β-amyloid plaques,
but has also been suggested for the analysis of myelin content due to its
consistent uptake in white matter. The aim of this study was to evaluate [11C]PIB
PET imaging as a tool for detecting demyelinated regions in white and grey matter
of non-human primate model of progressive MS.
METHODS: Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) was induced in marmosets
by injection of recombinant human myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (rhMOG)
emulsified in either Incomplete Freund's Adjuvant (IFA) or Complete Freund's
Adjuvant (CFA). [11C]PIB PET images were acquired prior to immunization
(baseline) and after symptoms were present (end of experiment). Brain tissue was 
isolated for histochemical analysis.
RESULTS: All rhMOG/IFA-treated and rhMOG/CFA-treated animals showed clinical
signs of EAE. The rhMOG/CFA group presented a significant [11C]PIB uptake
reduction only in the left motor cortex (9%, P = 0.011). For the rhMOG/IFA group,
significant decrease in [11C]PIB uptake was observed in the whole brain (15%,
P = 0.015), in the right hemisphere of body of corpus callosum (34%, P = 0.02),
splenium of corpus callosum (38%, P = 0.004), hippocampus (19%, P = 0.036), optic
tract (13%, P = 0.025), thalamus (14%, P = 0.041), Globus pallidus (23%,
P = 0.017), head of caudate nucleus (25%, P = 0.045), tail of caudate nucleus
(29%, P = 0.003), putamen (28%, P = 0.047) and left hemisphere of body of corpus 
callosum (14%, P = 0.037) and head of caudate nucleus (23%, P = 0.023). [11C]PIB 
uptake significantly correlated with luxol fast blue histology (myelin marker),
both in the rhMOG/IFA (r2= 0.32, P < 0.0001) and the rhMOG/CFA group (r2= 0.46, P
< 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: [11C]PIB PET imaging is an efficient tool for detecting demyelination
in grey and white matter, in a non-human primate model of progressive MS.

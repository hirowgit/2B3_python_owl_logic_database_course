Cross-fostering technique can be defined as adoption of infants by adults of
other species. This phenomenon is poorly investigated because very young animals 
have few opportunities to interact peacefully with non-conspecific adults, either
in captivity or in natural conditions. This study describes the induction of
cross-fostering in captivity between white tufted-ear (Callithrix jacchus) and
black tufted-ear marmosets (Callithrix penicillata). We conclude that this
technique can be very useful for preserving the life of rejected by parents or
orphan infants, mainly in the case of species with low reproduction rate in
captivity or those threatened by extinction, as well for investigating the
environmental effects on the typical behavior of species (courtship, food
preference, vocalization patterns, e.g.).

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a New World monkey that has attracted
much attention as a potentially useful primate model for preclinical testing. A
total of 36 marmoset cytochrome P450 (P450) isoforms in the P450 1-51 subfamilies
have been identified and characterized by the application of genome analysis and 
molecular functional characterization. In this mini-review, we provide an
overview of the genomic structures, sequence identities, and substrate
selectivities of marmoset P450s compared with those of human P450s. Based on the 
sequence identity, phylogeny, and genomic organization of marmoset P450s,
orthologous relationships were established between human and marmoset P450s.
Twenty-four members of the marmoset P450 1A, 2A, 2B, 2C, 2D, 2E, 3A, 4A, and 4F
subfamilies shared high degrees of homology in terms of cDNA (>89%) and amino
acid sequences (>85%) with the corresponding human P450s; P450 2C76 was among the
exceptions. Phylogenetic analysis using amino acid sequences revealed that
marmoset P450s in the P450 1-51 families were located in the same clades as their
human and macaque P450 homologs. This finding underlines the evolutionary
closeness of marmoset P450s to their human and macaque homologs. Most marmoset
P450 1-4 enzymes catalyzed the typical drug-metabolizing reactions of the
corresponding human P450 homologs, except for some differences of P450 2A6 and
2B6. Consequently, it appears that the substrate specificities of enzymes in the 
P450 1-4 families are generally similar in marmosets and humans. The information 
presented here supports a better understanding of the functional characteristics 
of marmoset P450s and their similarities and differences with human P450s. It is 
hoped that this mini-review will facilitate the successful use of marmosets as
primate models in drug metabolism and pharmacokinetic studies.

The extent to which vocal learning can be found in nonhuman primates is key to
reconstructing the evolution of speech. Regarding the adjustment of vocal output 
in relation to auditory experience (vocal production learning in the narrow
sense), effects on the ontogenetic trajectory of vocal development as well as
adjustment to group-specific call features have been found. Yet, a comparison of 
the vocalizations of different primate genera revealed striking similarities in
the structure of calls and repertoires in different species of the same genus,
indicating that the structure of nonhuman primate vocalizations is highly
conserved. Thus, modifications in relation to experience only appear to be
possible within relatively tight species-specific constraints. By contrast,
comprehension learning may be extremely rapid and open-ended. In conjunction,
these findings corroborate the idea of an ancestral independence of vocal
production and auditory comprehension learning. To overcome the futile debate
about whether or not vocal production learning can be found in nonhuman primates,
we suggest putting the focus on the different mechanisms that may mediate the
adjustment of vocal output in response to experience; these mechanisms may
include auditory facilitation and learning from success. This article is part of 
the theme issue 'What can animal communication teach us about human language?'

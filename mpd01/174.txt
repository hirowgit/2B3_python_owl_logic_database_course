Genetic modification of nonhuman primate (NHP) zygotes is a useful method for the
development of NHP models of human diseases. This review summarizes the recent
advances in the development of assisted reproductive and genetic manipulation
techniques in NHP, providing the basis for the generation of genetically modified
NHP disease models. In this study, we review assisted reproductive techniques,
including ovarian stimulation, in vitro maturation of oocytes, in vitro
fertilization, embryo culture, embryo transfer, and intracytoplasmic sperm
injection protocols in marmosets. Furthermore, we review genetic manipulation
techniques, including transgenic strategies, target gene knock-out and knock-in
using gene editing protocols, and newly developed gene-editing approaches that
may potentially impact the production of genetically manipulated NHP models. We
further discuss the progress of assisted reproductive and genetic manipulation
techniques in NHP; future prospects on genetically modified NHP models for
biomedical research are also highlighted.

Genetic modification of non-human primates (NHP) paves the way for realistic
disease models. The common marmoset is a NHP species increasingly used in
biomedical research. Despite the invention of RNA-guided nucleases, one strategy 
for protein overexpression in NHP is still lentiviral transduction. We generated 
three male and one female enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-transgenic
founder marmosets via lentiviral transduction of natural preimplantation embryos.
All founders accomplished germline transmission of the transgene by natural
mating, yielding 20 transgenic offspring together (in total, 45 pups; 44%
transgenic). This demonstrates that the transgenic gametes are capable of natural
fertilization even when in competition with wildtype gametes. Importantly, 90% of
the transgenic offspring showed transgene silencing, which is in sharp contrast
to rodents, where the identical transgene facilitated robust EGFP expression.
Furthermore, we consistently discovered somatic, but so far, no germ cell
chimerism in mixed wildtype/transgenic litters. Somatic cell chimerism resulted
in false-positive genotyping of the respective wildtype littermates. For the
discrimination of transgenic from transgene-chimeric animals by polymerase chain 
reaction on skin samples, a chimeric cell depletion protocol was established. In 
summary, it is possible to establish a cohort of genetically modified marmosets
by natural mating, but specific requirements including careful promoter selection
are essential.

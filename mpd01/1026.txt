A lack of immunocompetent-small-primate models has been an obstacle for
developing hepatitis C virus (HCV) vaccines and affordable antiviral drugs. In
this study, HCV/GB virus B (GBV-B) chimeric virus carrying the major
nonstructural proteins NS2 to NS4A (HCV NS2 to -4A chimera) was produced and used
to infect common marmosets, since HCV NS2 to NS4A proteins are critical proteases
and major antigens. Seven marmosets were inoculated intrahepatically with HCV NS2
to -4A chimera RNA for primary infection or intravenously injected with
chimera-containing serum for passage infection. Three animals used as controls
were injected with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or GBV-B, respectively. Six of
seven HCV NS2 to -4A chimera-infected marmosets exhibited consistent viremia and 
one showed transient viremia during the course of follow-up detection. All six
infected animals with persistent circulating viremia presented characteristics
typical of viral hepatitis, including viral RNA and proteins in hepatocytes and
histopathological changes in liver tissue. Viremia was consistently detected for 
5 to 54 weeks of follow-up. FK506 immunosuppression facilitated the establishment
of persistent chimera infection in marmosets. An animal with chimera infection
spontaneously cleared the virus in blood 7 weeks following the first inoculation,
but viral-RNA persistence, low-level viral protein, and mild necroinflammation
remained in liver tissue. The specific antibody and T-cell response to HCV NS3 in
this viremia-resolved marmoset was boosted by rechallenging, but no viremia was
detected during 57 weeks of follow-up. The chimera-infected marmosets described
can be used as a suitable small-primate animal model for studying novel antiviral
drugs and T-cell-based vaccines against HCV infection.IMPORTANCE: HCV infection
causes approximately 70% of chronic hepatitis and is frequently associated with
primary liver cancer globally. Chimpanzees have been used as a reliable primate
model for HCV infection, but ethical considerations have restricted their utility
in biomedical research. GB virus B (GBV-B) is a flavivirus related to HCV. It can
infect common marmosets, a New World small primate, and induces viral hepatitis
similar to HCV infection in humans. To minimize differences between GBV-B and
HCV, we generated HCV NS2 to -4A/GBV-B chimeric viruses and established a
chimera-infected marmoset model. HCV NS2 to -4A chimera-infected marmosets
provide a small-animal model for evaluating novel antiviral drugs targeting HCV
NS3-NS4A protease and T-cell-based HCV vaccines.

Recent advances in genome editing have facilitated the generation of nonhuman
primate (NHP) models, with potential to unmask the complex biology of human
disease not revealed by rodent models. However, their broader use is hindered by 
the challenges associated with generation of adult NHP models as well as the cost
of their production. Here, we describe the generation of a marmoset model of
severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). This study optimized zinc-finger
nucleases (ZFNs) and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) to 
target interleukin-2 receptor subunit gamma (IL2RG) in pronuclear stage marmoset 
embryos. Nine of 21 neonates exhibited mutations in the IL2RG gene, concomitant
with immunodeficiency, and three neonates have currently survived from 240 days
to 1.8 years. Our approach demonstrates highly efficient production of founder
NHP with SCID phenotypes, with promises of multiple pre-clinical and
translational applications.

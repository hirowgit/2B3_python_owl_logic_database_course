The CANTAB (Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery), a system
developed for human neuropsychological testing, has previously been used to
assess cognitive function in two species of nonhuman primates, common marmoset
monkeys and rhesus macaques. We describe the application of the system to the
juvenile baboon, a nonhuman primate species offering specific investigative
advantages. Juvenile baboons were trained and tested on a progressive ratio task 
to assess motivation, simple discrimination and simple reversal tasks to assess
associative learning, and intra- and extra-dimensional set-shifting tasks to
assess selective attention and attentional set-shifting, respectively. Study
subjects were 8 juvenile baboons (Papio sp.), 4 females and 4 males aged
3.0+/-0.1 (mean+SEM) years and weight 8.2+/-0.4 kg. All baboons were easily
trained, readily learned the neuropsychological tests and exhibited a stable
performance. Applying a method such as the CANTAB has significant implications
for expanding on the translational utility of the baboon in studies of
neurodevelopment.

OBJECTIVES: Neuropsychiatric symptoms are increasingly recognised as a
significant problem in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). These symptoms may
be due to 'sensitisation' following repeated levodopa treatment or a direct
effect of dopamine on the disease state. The levodopa-treated MPTP-lesioned
marmoset was used as a model of neuropsychiatric symptoms in PD patients. Here we
compare the time course of levodopa-induced motor fluctuations and
neuropsychiatric-like behaviors to determine the relationship between duration of
treatment and onset of symptoms.
METHODS: Marmosets were administered 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine
(2.0 mg/kg s.c.) for five days, resulting in stable parkinsonism. Levodopa (15
mg/kg and benserazide, 3.75 mg/kg) p.o. b.i.d, was administered for 30 days.
Animals were evaluated for parkinsonian disability, dyskinesia and on-time (motor
fluctuations) and neuropsychiatric-like behaviors on Day 0 (prior to levodopa)
and on Days 1, 7, 13, 27 and 30 of treatment using post hoc DVD analysis by a
trained rater, blind to the treatment day.
RESULTS: The neuropsychiatric-like behavior rating scale demonstrated high
interrater reliability between three trained raters of differing professional
backgrounds. As anticipated, animals exhibited a progressive increase in
levodopa-induced motor fluctuations, dyskinesia and wearing-off, that correlated 
with the duration of levodopa therapy. In contrast, levodopa-induced
neuropsychiatric-like behaviors were present on Day 1 of levodopa treatment and
their severity did not correlate with duration of treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that neuropsychiatric disorders in PD are more
likely an interaction between levodopa and the disease state than a consequence
of sensitisation to repeated dopaminergic therapy.

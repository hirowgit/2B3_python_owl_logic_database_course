BACKGROUND: Biomedical research has recently focused on developing new models of 
human disease by implementing genome-editing strategies in non-human primates
(NHPs) to introduce relevant gene mutations. There is a need to establish
objective semen evaluation methods to select sires for in vitro fertilization to 
perform germline editing in embryos.
METHODS: Sperm motility kinematic parameters were evaluated using a
computer-assisted semen analysis (CASA) instrument for rhesus macaques (Macaca
mulatta), cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis), and common marmosets
(Callithrix jacchus).
RESULTS: Normative sperm kinematic parameters were established, revealing
differences between marmosets and macaques. The impact of season on rhesus
macaque sperm motility was modest, where changes in sperm motility related to
season were dependent on the individual male.
CONCLUSIONS: These data provide a baseline of normative kinematic parameters for 
three captive NHP species, in which implementation of CASA may serve as a tool to
evaluate NHP semen quality.

Personality in animals has been extensively researched in recent decades.
Temporal consistency of behaviors is almost always part of the personality
definition and is usually explored in several different testing sessions or
observation periods. However, it is still unclear whether the obtained
personality constructs are stable across several years, which might be especially
important for long-living animals, such as primates. Further, little is known on 
whether the personality structures obtained in the laboratory reflect the
structures obtained under ecologically relevant conditions in the wild.
Therefore, we conducted a battery of personality tests on common marmosets
(Callithrix jacchus) (N = 27), compared it with a test battery conducted 4 years 
beforehand on a subset of animals in captivity (N = 13) and ran an adapted
version under field conditions at Baracuhy Biological Field Station, Brazil
(N = 18). Under captive conditions, we found a remarkably similar personality
structure across 4 testing years. Further, we found high long-term temporal
consistency in the first two personality components, Boldness and Exploration;
however, monkeys that changed their social (i.e., breeding) status between the
two testing periods showed a significant increase in Boldness scores. Under field
conditions, we found a somewhat similar personality structure as compared to the 
laboratory, which to some extent corroborates ecological validity of our
personality test design. Nevertheless, whether the structure in the wild is
suppressed or expanded in comparison to captivity, and in which way the social
setting influences personality structure, should be further explored. Taken
together, our results contribute to the discussion about the reliability and
ecological validity of personality structures in nonhuman primates.

Parvocellular (P-) and magnocellular (M-) cells in the marmoset LGN can receive
prominent rod input up to relatively high illuminance levels (Kremers et al.,
1997b). In the present paper, we quantify rod and cone input strengths under
different retinal illuminance levels. The stimulus was based on the so-called
"silent substitution" method. The activities of P- and M-cells of dichromatic
animals were recorded extracellularly. We were able to adequately describe the
response amplitudes and phases by a vector summation of rod and cone signals. At 
low retinal illuminance levels, the cells' responses were determined by rod and
cone inputs. With increasing illuminances the strength of the cone input
increased relative to the rod strength. But, we often found significant rod
inputs up to illuminances equivalent to 700 td in the human eye or more. Rod
input strength was more pronounced in cells with receptive fields at large
retinal eccentricities. The phase differences between rod and cone inputs suggest
that the rod signals lag about 45 ms behind the cone signals.

PROBLEM: The unique recognition events that result in the avid binding of
mammalian spermatozoa to the surface of the zona pellucida (ZP) are being
exploited in the development of contraceptive vaccines. In this study, the safety
and efficacy of a vaccination strategy based on the induction of active immunity 
against purified, glycosylated, recombinant human ZP3 (rhZP3) has been evaluated 
in a primate model, Callithrix jacchus.
METHOD OF STUDY: Long-term infertility was established after immunization with
rhZP3 and the resulting immune sera reacted with rhZP3 on an enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunolocalized exclusively to the outer surface 
of native ZP on marmoset ovarian sections. However, this contraceptive effect was
inevitably associated with the eventual appearance of an ovarian pathology
characterized by a depletion of primordial follicles. In an attempt to circumvent
this side effect, human ZP3 (hZP3) was epitope mapped and four continuous,
immunodominant B-cell epitopes (hZP3(45-64), hZP3(93-110), hZP3(172-190) and
hZP3(341-360) were evaluated for contraceptive efficacy in vivo. Using
peptide-tetanus toxoid (TT) conjugates to enhance immunogenicity, antipeptide
antibodies were raised against these immunogens, which also cross-reacted with
rhZP3 on ELISA. In addition, antibodies against hZP3(45-64) and hZP3(172-190)
recognized native ZP on marmoset ovarian sections when a microwave technique was 
used to enhance epitope presentation.
RESULTS: No ovarian pathology was observed after the long-term administration of 
these peptide immunogens, and fertility was suppressed when compared with TT
controls but could not be correlated to the antibody titer.
CONCLUSION: Clearly, further research is required to identify optimal B-cell
epitopes that will reliably induce infertility, free from any ovarian pathology.

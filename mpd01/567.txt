Throughout the primate lineage, there is a wide diversity of prehensile capacity 
that is thought to stem from individual species foraging patterns. While many
studies have explored primates with precise hand grips, such as higher apes, few 
have considered primates that lack opposition movements. The New World marmoset
monkey occupies an intriguing niche, displaying adept control of their hand
movements yet their absence of opposable digits results in relatively imprecise
grasping actions when compared with those observed in Old World monkeys, apes,
and humans. The marmoset monkey offers a unique composition of ancestral primate 
corticospinal organization combined with skilled hand use to explore the
evolution and development of visually-guided actions. In this study, four adult
marmosets were trained to perform a series of visually-guided tasks, designed to 
assess their control over locating and retrieving objects of differing
dimensions. Two of these animals received a neonatal lesion of the inferior
pulvinar (unilateral), a thalamic nucleus previously demonstrated to be involved 
in visuomotor development. The kinematics of their reaching and grasping patterns
were recorded for offline analysis. Predictive modeling revealed that maximum
grip aperture, time to reach peak velocity and hand use were reliable predictors 
of distinguishing between cohorts. A consistent feature observed across all tasks
was that they do not precisely scale their grip according to the dimensions of
the target object which may be attributed to their lack of independent digit
control. Therefore, the marmoset monkey represents a previously understudied
position in the evolution of primate reach and grasp behavior.

Microelectrode implants are an important tool in neuroscience research and in
developing brain⁻machine interfaces. Data from rodents have consistently shown
that astrocytes are recruited to the area surrounding implants, forming a glial
scar that increases electrode impedance and reduces chronic utility. However,
studies in non-human primates are scarce, with none to date in marmosets. We used
glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunostaining to characterize the acute
and chronic response of the marmoset brain to microelectrodes. By using
densitometry, we showed that marmoset astrocytes surround brain implants and that
a glial scar is formed over time, with significant increase in the chronic
condition relative to the acute condition animal.

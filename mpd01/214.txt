The rapid adoption of marmosets in neuroscience has created a demand for three
dimensional (3D) atlases of the brain of this species to facilitate data
integration in a common reference space. We report on a new open access template 
of the marmoset cortex (the Nencki-Monash, or NM template), representing a
morphological average of 20 brains of young adult individuals, obtained by 3D
reconstructions generated from Nissl-stained serial sections. The method used to 
generate the template takes into account morphological features of the individual
brains, as well as the borders of clearly defined cytoarchitectural areas. This
has resulted in a resource which allows direct estimates of the most likely
coordinates of each cortical area, as well as quantification of the margins
of error involved in assigning voxels to areas, and preserves quantitative
information about the laminar structure of the cortex. We provide spatial
transformations between the NM and other available marmoset brain templates, thus
enabling integration with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and tracer-based
connectivity data. The NM template combines some of the main advantages of
histology-based atlases (e.g. information about the cytoarchitectural structure) 
with features more commonly associated with MRI-based templates (isotropic nature
of the dataset, and probabilistic analyses). The underlying workflow may be found
useful in the future development of 3D brain atlases that incorporate information
about the variability of areas in species for which it may be impractical to
ensure homogeneity of the sample in terms of age, sex and genetic background.

GPR56, a member of the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor family, is abundantly 
expressed in cells of the developing cerebral cortex, including neural progenitor
cells and developing neurons. The human GPR56 gene has multiple presumptive
promoters that drive the expression of the GPR56 protein in distinct patterns.
Similar to coding mutations of the human GPR56 gene that may cause GPR56
dysfunction, a 15-bp homozygous deletion in the cis-regulatory element upstream
of the noncoding exon 1 of GPR56 (e1m) leads to the cerebral cortex malformation 
and epilepsy. To clarify the expression profile of the e1m promoter-driven GPR56 
in primate brain, we generated a transgenic marmoset line in which EGFP is
expressed under the control of the human minimal e1m promoter. In contrast to the
endogenous GPR56 protein, which is highly enriched in the ventricular zone of the
cerebral cortex, EGFP is mostly expressed in developing neurons in the transgenic
fetal brain. Furthermore, EGFP is predominantly expressed in GABAergic neurons,
whereas the total GPR56 protein is evenly expressed in both GABAergic and
glutamatergic neurons, suggesting the GABAergic neuron-preferential activity of
the minimal e1m promoter. These results indicate a possible pathogenic role for
GABAergic neuron in the cerebral cortex of patients with GPR56 mutations.

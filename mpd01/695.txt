Behavioral coordination is a fundamental element of human cooperation. It is
facilitated when individuals represent not only their own actions but also those 
of their partner. Identifying whether action corepresentation is unique to humans
or also present in other species is therefore necessary to fully understand the
evolution of human cooperation. We used the auditory joint Simon task to assess
whether action corepresentation occurs in common marmosets, a monkey species that
engages extensively in coordinated action during cooperative infant care. We
found that marmosets indeed show a joint Simon effect. Furthermore, when
coordinating their behavior in the joint task, they were more likely to look at
their partner than in a joint control condition. Corepresentation is thus not
unique to humans but also present in the cooperatively breeding marmosets. Since 
marmosets are small-brained monkeys, our results suggest that routine
coordination in space and time, rather than complex cognitive abilities, plays a 
role in the evolution of corepresentation.

Multiple sclerosis is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central
nervous system. Although it has been extensively studied, the proximate trigger
of the immune response remains uncertain. Experimental autoimmune
encephalomyelitis in the common marmoset recapitulates many radiological and
pathological features of focal multiple sclerosis lesions in the cerebral white
matter, unlike traditional experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in rodents. 
This provides an opportunity to investigate how lesions form as well as the
relative timing of factors involved in lesion pathogenesis, especially during
early stages of the disease. We used MRI to track experimental autoimmune
encephalomyelitis lesions in vivo to determine their age, stage of development,
and location, and we assessed the corresponding histopathology post-mortem. We
focused on the plasma protein fibrinogen-a marker for blood-brain barrier leakage
that has also been linked to a pathogenic role in inflammatory demyelinating
lesion development. We show that fibrinogen has a specific spatiotemporal
deposition pattern, apparently deriving from the central vein in early
experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis lesions <6 weeks old, and preceding
both demyelination and visible gadolinium enhancement on MRI. Thus, fibrinogen
leakage is one of the earliest detectable events in lesion pathogenesis. In
slightly older lesions, fibrinogen is found inside microglia/macrophages,
suggesting rapid phagocytosis. Quantification demonstrates positive correlation
of fibrinogen deposition with accumulation of inflammatory cells, including
microglia/macrophages and T cells. The peak of fibrinogen deposition coincides
with the onset of demyelination and axonal loss. In samples from chronic multiple
sclerosis cases, fibrinogen was found at the edge of chronic active lesions,
which have ongoing demyelination and inflammation, but not in inactive lesions,
suggesting that fibrinogen may play a role in sustained inflammation even in the 
chronic setting. In summary, our data support the notion that fibrinogen is a key
player in the early pathogenesis, as well as sustained inflammation, of
inflammatory demyelinating lesions.

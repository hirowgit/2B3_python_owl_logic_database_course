Trazodone is a clinically available anti-depressant that exhibits affinity for
serotonin 1A and 2A receptors, as well as for alpha-adrenoceptors, suggesting
that it may be useful to treat L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA)-induced
dyskinesia and psychosis that are encountered in advanced Parkinson's disease
(PD). Here, we investigated the anti-dyskinetic and anti-psychotic effects of
trazodone in the parkinsonian non-human primate. 6 common marmosets were rendered
parkinsonian by administration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine
(MPTP). Following repeated administration of L-DOPA to induce stable dyskinesia
and psychosis-like behaviours (PLBs), trazodone (0.1, 1 and 10 mg/kg) or vehicle 
was administered in combination with L-DOPA and its effects on dyskinesia, PLBs
and parkinsonism were determined. The addition of trazodone 10 mg/kg to L-DOPA
reduced peak dose dyskinesia by ≈ 39% (P < 0.01) and peak dose PLBs by ≈ 17%
(P < 0.01). However, parkinsonian disability was significantly worsened by
trazodone 10 mg/kg (P < 0.05) and duration of anti-parkinsonian action was
diminished by ≈ 21% (P < 0.05). Our results suggest that trazodone may be
effective in alleviating L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia and psychosis in PD, but its
deleterious effect on motor function is a concern and may limit its tolerability 
and usefulness in clinical settings.

A specific pathogen free (SPF) barrier colony of breeding marmosets (Callithrix
jacchus) was established at the Barshop Institute for Longevity and Aging
Studies. Rodent and other animal models maintained as SPF barrier colonies have
demonstrated improved health and lengthened lifespans enhancing the quality and
repeatability of aging research. The marmosets were screened for two viruses and 
several bacterial pathogens prior to establishing the new SPF colony. Twelve
founding animals successfully established a breeding colony with increased
reproductive success, improved health parameters, and increased median lifespan
when compared to a conventionally housed, open colony. The improved health and
longevity of marmosets from the SPF barrier colony suggests that such management 
can be used to produce a unique resource for future studies of aging processes in
a nonhuman primate model.

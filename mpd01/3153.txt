De novo administration of long-acting dopamine agonists, such as ropinirole, to
patients with Parkinson's disease or to
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated subhuman primates
produces a lower incidence of dyskinesia than occurs with L-DOPA. This study
compares the intensity of dyskinesia produced by combinations of L-DOPA and
ropinirole and by these drugs alone, using the MPTP-treated common marmoset model
of Parkinson's disease. The objective is to determine the optimum therapeutic
strategy for the long-term control of Parkinson's disease with a minimal risk of 
dyskinesia. MPTP-treated marmosets received either L-DOPA alone, ropinirole
alone, or one of two combinations of these drugs (either L-DOPA dominant or
ropinirole dominant) daily for 28 days in doses titrated to produce a similar
improvement in disability and increase in locomotion. In the group receiving
L-DOPA alone, there was a trend for peak dose locomotor activity to increase and 
the duration of drug effect to decline over the period of the study. L-DOPA alone
induced marked dyskinesia over the period of treatment, in contrast to ropinirole
which produced a low intensity of involuntary movements. The L-DOPA dominant
combination initially produced little dyskinesia, but this became increasingly
intense as the study progressed. In contrast, the ropinirole dominant combination
produced no greater intensity of dyskinesia than was produced by ropinirole
alone. These data suggest that in early Parkinson's disease, the use of
ropinirole alone or in combination with a low-dose L-DOPA might delay the
induction of dyskinesias while improving motor performance.

On the relationship between plasma concentrations of drugs and outcome of stroke 
studies in laboratory animals.

In assessing plasma concentrations of drugs in relation to neuroprotective
effect, emphasis should be placed on measured or calculated concentrations during
the window of opportunity for effect, rather than at the end of the experiment.
Unbound (plasma free) concentrations should be especially considered as should
brain penetration to the stroked area. Problem-solving exercises should include
post hoc assessment of dosing residues and proof of exposure. The shape of the
graph of response versus concentration in plasma is very steep, giving the
impression of an all-or-none effect. Although higher doses lead to greater
effects, attempts to statistically correlate plasma level and infarct size are
likely to be unsuccessful. There is strong evidence that the pharmacokinetic
properties of drugs are affected by the physiological consequences of ischemia.

The differentiation of spermatids in the marmoset (Callithrix jacchus, n = 9)
testis is described here at the light-microscopic level employing serial semithin
sections. The definition of 8 different phases of spermiogenesis, i.e. the
formation of spermatids, is based upon the changes in the development of nucleus,
acrosome and flagellum.

The possibility was examined that the membrane function of erythrocytes obtained 
from healthy common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) was modified by the presence
in the cells of Heinz bodies. No significant differences were found in
erythrocyte endogenous free malonyl dialdehyde (MDA) or reduced glutathione (GSH)
between normal human erythrocytes and marmoset erythrocytes containing Heinz
bodies. Membrane fluorescent chromolipids, surface charge and thiol levels were
similar in both species but average membrane bulk lipid fluidity was slightly
elevated in the marmosets. It was concluded that, in contrast to the situation in
human erythrocytes, the presence of Heinz bodies in red cells of marmosets does
not adversely affect the properties of the membrane.

Plasma aminotransferase measurements in the marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).

Cowie JR, Evans GO.

Plasma aminotransferase values were measured in a large number of samples from
male and female marmosets. There were no differences due to age or sex for either
AST or ALT. Haemolysis affected values for both enzymes, though the effect on ALT
was greater.

Distribution of parasympathetic motoneurones in the oculomotor complex
innervating the ciliary ganglion in the marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).

Clarke RJ, Coimbra CJ, Al√©ssio ML.

Parasympathetic motoneurones in the oculomotor complex which innervate the
ciliary ganglion were identified using the horseradish peroxidase (HRP)
retrograde axonal tracer technique. The ciliary ganglion was located behind the
eye by a lateral orbital approach and injected with HRP pellets mounted on the
tips of microelectrodes. Most of the labelled cells were distributed throughout
the whole Edinger-Westphal nucleus (EW). Outside the EW, only a small number of
labelled cells were found, and most of these were located in the median zone
ventral to the EW. There was no evidence of a division of the EW into rostral and
posterior subnuclei, nor for separate cell populations in the EW and the anterior
median nucleus (AM), respectively. At rostral levels labelled cells were confined
to the EW with no overlap into the AM. In contrast to most previous studies no
labelled cells were found in the AM. The possible physiological functions of the 
EW and the ventral components of the EW are discussed.

The palmaris longus is considered a phylogenetic degenerate metacarpophalangeal
joint flexor muscle in humans, a small vestigial forearm muscle; it is the most
variable muscle in humans, showing variation in position, duplication, slips and 
could be reverted. It is frequently studied in papers about human anatomical
variations in cadavers and in vivo, its variation has importance in medical
clinic, surgery, radiological analysis, in studies about high-performance
athletes, in genetics and anthropologic studies. Most studies about palmaris
longus in humans are associated to frequency or case studies, but comparative
anatomy in primates and comparative morphometry were not found in scientific
literature. Comparative anatomy associated to morphometry of palmaris longus
could explain the degeneration observed in this muscle in two of three of the
great apes. Hypothetically, the comparison of the relative length of tendons and 
belly could indicate the pathway of the degeneration of this muscle, that is, the
degeneration could be associated to increased tendon length and decreased belly
from more primitive primates to those most derivate, that is, great apes to
modern humans. In conclusion, in primates, the tendon of the palmaris longus
increase from Lemuriformes to modern humans, that is, from arboreal to
terrestrial primates and the muscle became weaker and tending to be missing.

The natural killer group 2 membrane D (NKG2D) receptor is an NK-activating
receptor that plays an important role in host defense against tumors and viral
infections. Although the marmoset is an important and reliable animal model,
especially for the study of human-specific viral infections, functional
characterization of NKG2D on marmoset NK cells has not previously been conducted.
In the present study, we investigated a subpopulation of marmoset NK cells that
express NKG2D and exhibit cytolytic potential. On the basis of their CD16 and
CD56 expression patterns, marmoset NK cells can be classified into three
subpopulations: CD16(+) CD56(-), CD16(-) CD56(+) and CD16(-) CD56(-) cells. NKG2D
expression on marmoset CD16(+) CD56(-) and CD16(-) CD56(+) splenocytes was
confirmed using an NKG2D ligand composed of an MHC class I chain-related molecule
A (MICA)-Fc fusion protein. When marmoset splenocytes were cultured with IL-2 for
4 days, NKG2D expression was retained on CD16(+) CD56(-) and CD16(-) CD56(+). In 
addition, CD16(+) CD56(+) cells within the marmoset NK population appeared which 
expressed NKG2D after IL-2 stimulation. IL-2-activated marmoset NK cells showed
strong cytolytic activity against K562 target cells and target cells stably
expressing MICA. Further, the cytolytic activity of marmoset splenocytes was
significantly reduced after addition of MICA-Fc fusion protein. Thus, NKG2D
functions as an activating receptor on marmoset NK cells that possesses cytotoxic
potential, and phenotypic profiles of marmoset NK cell subpopulations are similar
to those seen in humans.

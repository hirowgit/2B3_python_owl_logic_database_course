Lipid composition of marmoset saliva.

Murty VL, Slomiany BL, Zdebska E, Slomiany A, Mandel ID, Levy M.

The lipid content and composition of marmoset saliva was investigated. Extraction
of the dialyzed and lyophilized saliva with chloroform/methanol yielded 15.6 +/- 
3.1 mg of lipids/100 ml of saliva. Of the total lipids, 41.7% were represented by
neutral lipids, 50.7% by glycolipids and 7.6% by phospholipids. Neutral lipids
had a high content of free fatty acids (67.0%), cholesterol and its esters
(20.0%) and triglycerides (11.8%). The glycolipid fraction was comprised of
simple glycosphingolipids (13.2%), and of neutral and sulfated glyceroglucolipids
(86.8%), whereas sphingomyelin, phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine 
accounted for 63.6% of the total phospholipids. The results indicate that
marmoset saliva, in comparison to that of human, contains twice as much of total 
lipids and exhibits an elevated level of phospholipids, and glycolipids.

Human T-cell leukemia virus: transformation in vitro of nonhuman primate
T-lymphocytes and experimental inoculation of nonhuman primates.

Falk LA Jr, Byington R, Silva DP.

T-lymphocytes from three species of New World monkeys were susceptible to
transformation in vitro with human T-cell leukemia virus. Marmoset T-lymphocytes 
transformed in vitro with HVS or HVA, T-lymphotropic herpesviruses of New World
monkeys, were also transformed with HTLV resulting in doubly transformed T-cells.
This finding may provide a potential model for investigating the possible
interaction between a herpesvirus and T-lymphotropic retroviruses in the clinical
condition AIDS.

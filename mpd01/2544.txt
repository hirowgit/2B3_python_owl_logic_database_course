OBJECTIVE: To determine sildenafil citrate (SC) genotoxicity and cytotoxicity in 
the Callithrix jacchus.
STUDY DESIGN: Fifteen organisms were assigned to one of three groups as follows: 
experimental (25 mg/kg of SC); negative control (glucose solution 5%); and
positive control (3 mg/kg of cytocine arabinoside). Systemic hemodynamic changes 
were monitored in each animal before and after each treatment. A drop of blood
was obtained before and after the treatment at 24-120 h. Smears were made and the
frequency of micronucleated erythrocytes (MNE), micronucleated polychromatic
erythrocytes (MNPCE) and polychromatic erythrocytes (PCE) was counted.
RESULTS: No significant differences in MNE, MNPCE and PCE were found in the group
that received sildenafil and negative control. A significant increase in
genotoxicity and cytotoxicity was observed in the positive control group. No
changes were observed in systemic hemodynamic changes.
CONCLUSION: The macro-dose of SC lacks genotoxic, cytotoxic or systemic
hemodynamic changes effects in this species.

With the CAmbridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB),
computerized neuropsychological tasks can be presented on a touch-sensitive
computer screen, and this system has been used to assess cognitive processes in
neuropsychiatric patients, healthy volunteers, and species of non-human primate, 
primarily the rhesus macaque and common marmoset. Recently, we reported that the 
common marmoset, a small-bodied primate, can be trained to a high and stable
level of performance on the CANTAB five-choice serial reaction time (5-CSRT) task
of attention, and a novel task of working memory, the concurrent delayed
match-to-position (CDMP) task. Here, in order to increase understanding of the
specific cognitive demands of these tasks and the importance of acetylcholine to 
their performance, the effects of systemic delivery of the muscarinic receptor
antagonist scopolamine and the nicotinic receptor agonist nicotine were studied. 
In the 5-CSRT task, nicotine enhanced performance in terms of increased sustained
attention, whilst scopolamine led to increased omissions despite a high level of 
orientation to the correct stimulus location. In the CDMP task, scopolamine
impaired performance at two stages of the task that differ moderately in terms of
memory retention load but both of which are likely to require working memory,
including interference-coping, abilities. Nicotine tended to enhance performance 
at the long-delay stage specifically but only against a background of relatively 
low baseline performance. These data are consistent with a dissociation of the
roles of muscarinic and nicotinic cholinergic receptors in the regulation of both
sustained attention and working memory in primates.

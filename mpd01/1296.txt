The marmoset spinal cord possesses all the characteristic features of a typical
mammalian spinal cord, but with some interesting variation in the levels of
origin of the limb nerves. In our study Nissl and ChAT sections of the each
segment of the spinal cord in two marmosets (Ma5 and Ma8), we found that the
spinal cord can be functionally and anatomically divided into six regions: the
prebrachial region (C1 to C3); the brachial region (C4 to C8) - segments
supplying the upper limb; the post-brachial region (T1 to L1) - containing the
sympathetic outflow, and supplying the hypaxial muscles of the body wall; the
crural region (L2 to L5) - segments supplying the lower limb; the postcrural
region (L6) - containing the parasympathetic outflow; and the caudal region (L7
to Co4) - supplying the tail. In the rat, mouse, and rhesus monkey, the
prebrachial region consists of segments C1 to C4 (with the phrenic nucleus
located at the C4 segment), and the brachial region extends from C5 to T1
inclusive. The prefixing of the upper limb outflow in these two marmosets mirrors
the finding in the literature that a large C4 contribution to the brachial plexus
is common in humans.

Parental behavior is important for the development of mammalian offspring.
Research on the mechanisms underlying parental behavior, however, has been
largely restricted to rodent models. As a consequence, although research on
parent-infant relationships has been conducted using macaque monkeys for more
than half a century, little is known about the neural mechanisms and brain
regions associated with such behaviors in primates. This article reviews parental
behavior and its endocrinological mechanisms in marmosets and tamarins, both
cooperative breeders in the callitrichid family, and compares these findings with
studies of macaque monkeys. The paper examines the similarities and differences
between marmosets and humans, and suggests the possibility that marmosets can be 
a model for future studies of the neural underpinnings and endocrinology
underlying human parental behavior.

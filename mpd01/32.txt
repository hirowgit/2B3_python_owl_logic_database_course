Genetic intervention is increasingly being explored as a therapeutic option for
debilitating disorders of the central nervous system. The safety and efficacy of 
gene therapies rely upon expressing a transgene in affected cells while
minimizing off-target expression. Here we show organ-specific targeting of
adeno-associated virus (AAV) capsids after intravenous delivery, which we
achieved by employing a Cre-transgenic-based screening platform and sequential
engineering of AAV-PHP.eB between the surface-exposed AA452 and AA460 of VP3.
From this selection, we identified capsid variants that were enriched in the
brain and targeted away from the liver in C57BL/6J mice. This tropism extends to 
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), enabling robust, non-invasive gene delivery to the
marmoset brain after intravenous administration. Notably, the capsids identified 
result in distinct transgene expression profiles within the brain, with one
exhibiting high specificity to neurons. The ability to cross the blood-brain
barrier with neuronal specificity in rodents and non-human primates enables new
avenues for basic research and therapeutic possibilities unattainable with
naturally occurring serotypes.

An 11-year-old male common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) presented with chronic, 
progressive weight loss and diarrhoea. Response to treatment with nutritional
supplementation, antibiotics and immunosuppressants was modest and transient, and
the animal was humanely euthanized. At necropsy, the proximal 8 cm of small
intestine was diffusely pale with transmural thickening. The lungs contained
coalescing tan, firm nodules measuring up to 4 mm in diameter. Histological
examination revealed infiltrative mucinous adenocarcinoma of the duodenum with
extensive metastases to the lungs, liver and left parapatellar adipose tissue.
The mucinous matrix secreted by the primary and metastatic lesions was strongly
periodic acid-Schiff positive. Warthin Starry staining for spirochaetes was
negative. Pancytokeratin expression was attenuated in the primary tumour as well 
as in the metastases, which correlated to a poorly differentiated phenotype. To
the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of a proximal duodenal
adenocarcinoma with extensive metastatic disease in a common marmoset.

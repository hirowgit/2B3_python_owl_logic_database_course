Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disorder manifested via chronic
inflammation, demyelination, and neurodegeneration inside the central nervous
system. The progressive phase of MS is characterized by neurodegeneration, but
unlike classical neurodegenerative diseases, amyloid-like aggregation of
self-proteins has not been documented. There is evidence that citrullination
protects an immunodominant peptide of human myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein
(MOG34-56) against destructive processing in Epstein-Barr virus-infected
B-lymphocytes (EBV-BLCs) in marmosets and causes exacerbation of ongoing MS-like 
encephalopathies in mice. Here we collected evidence that citrullination of MOG
can also lead to amyloid-like behavior shifting the disease pathogenesis toward
neurodegeneration. We observed that an immunodominant MOG peptide, MOG35-55,
displays amyloid-like behavior upon site-specific citrullination at positions 41,
46, and/or 52. These amyloid aggregates are shown to be toxic to the EBV-BLCs and
to dendritic cells at concentrations favored for antigen presentation, suggesting
a role of amyloid-like aggregation in the pathogenesis of progressive MS.

The core functional organization of the primate brain is remarkably conserved
across the order, but behavioral differences evident between species likely
reflect derived modifications in the underlying neural processes. Here, we
performed the first study to directly compare visual recognition memory in two
primate species-rhesus macaques and marmoset monkeys-on the same visual
preferential looking task as a first step toward identifying similarities and
differences in this cognitive process across the primate phylogeny. Preferences
in looking behavior on the task were broadly similar between the species, with
greater looking times for novel images compared with repeated images as well as a
similarly strong preference for faces compared with other categories.
Unexpectedly, we found large behavioral differences among the two species in
looking behavior independent of image familiarity. Marmosets exhibited longer
looking times, with greater variability compared with macaques, regardless of
image content or familiarity. Perhaps most strikingly, marmosets shifted their
gaze across the images more quickly, suggesting a different behavioral strategy
when viewing images. Although such differences limit the comparison of
recognition memory across these closely related species, they point to
interesting differences in the mechanisms underlying active vision that have
significant implications for future neurobiological investigations with these two
nonhuman primate species. Elucidating whether these patterns are reflective of
species or broader phylogenetic differences (e.g., between New World and Old
World monkeys) necessitates a broader sample of primate taxa from across the
Order.

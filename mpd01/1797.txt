Perception-based measures often reveal much earlier competencies than
action-based approaches. We explored this phenomenon generally labeled as
"knowledge dissociation" in 28 common marmoset monkeys (Callithrix jacchus) using
a paradigm where subjects had to localize a food item dropped down an opaque
tube. Experiments 1 and 2 assessed common marmoset monkeys' gravity bias in an
action based version of the tubes task. Experiments 3 and 4 investigated whether 
marmosets' performance increases in an action-free task context where they simply
look at objects falling down a tube. The results suggest that common marmosets
have some intuition of continuity/solidity constraints when tested with
perception based measures even though these principles do not appear to guide
their search for falling objects.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the retinal penetration and toxicity of two doses of
intravitreal infliximab in primates.
METHODS: Ten marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) were given intravitreal injection of 
100 μg or 400 μg of infliximab, and balanced salt solution served as control. At 
baseline and after 24 hours (5 animals) and 7 days (the other 5), the eyes were
examined by electroretinography. They were then killed (at 24 hours and 7 days)
and assessed by light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy for
toxicity and immunohistochemistry, using a biotinylated anti-human immunoglobulin
G, to evaluate retinal penetration.
RESULTS: There was no difference over 50% of the electroretinography b-wave
between baseline and the time points studied in all animals. Light and electron
microscopy, and electroretinography analysis, showed no signs of toxicity in any 
of the animals. Strong presence of infliximab was observed in all retinal layers 
7 days after intravitreal injection at both doses (100 and 400 μg).
CONCLUSION: Infliximab at doses of 100 and 400 μg seemed to cause no damage to
the retina 24 hours and 7 days after its intravitreal injection, and deeply
penetrated all its layers, in primates. These results encourage future
perspectives for the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases of the retina in 
humans.

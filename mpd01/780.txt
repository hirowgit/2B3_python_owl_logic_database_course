BACKGROUND: Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) induced by
self-myelin antigen is a widely used in multiple sclerosis (MS) model for
preclinical studies of new therapeutics and potential pathogenesis. By comparison
with rodent EAE models, EAE models in primates are more similar to MS. Some
groups have developed EAE models in primates by using common marmoset (Callithrix
jacchus). However, this model has some limitations. EAE in cynomolgus monkey
(Macaque fasciculrais) could overcome these limitations.
OBJECTIVES: The main objective of this study was to establish an ideal EAE
cynomolgus monkey model resembling human MS by immunizing human myelin
oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) protein.
METHODS: In this study, six female cynomolgus monkeys were divided into two
separate experiment groups and one monkey as the control. EAE was induced in
cynomolgus monkey by immunizing with the recombinant human myelin oligodendrocyte
glycoprotein extracellular domain (1-125) (rhMOG1-125) and a synthetic peptide,
representing peptide 34-56 of human myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein
(MOG34-56) in complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) by subcutaneous multipoint
immunization in the armpit and inguinal region and in combination with
intravenous injection of pertussis toxin, and subsequent booster immunizations
with the same dose of antigen in incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA) until the
animals developed clinically significant EAE (score≥2). The body weight, clinical
scores, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), histopathology, antibody, cytokine
profiling and antigen-specific lymphocyte proliferation were evaluated.
RESULTS: The results showed that despite the different time intervals between
onset and significant neurological deficits, all the cynomolgus monkeys immunized
with rhMOG1-125 or MOG34-56 developed clinically significant acute fulminant or
mild forms of EAE, with a success rate of 100%. The clinical courses were obvious
heterogeneity which closely resembles MS. MOG34-56 immunization was much milder
compared with rhMOG1-125 immunized individuals, at least in cynomolgus monkeys.
Inflammation and demyelinated lesions were present in the brains and spinal
cords. Immune profiling revealed high IgG levels associated with early onset of
EAE but not the course of the disease. Significant antigen-specific T lymphocyte 
responses against immunodominant epitopes of MOG were also detected.
CONCLUSION: Our results indicated rhMOG1-125 and MOG34-56 could induce
successfully EAE models resembling MS in cynomolgus monkeys. The synergistic
action of anti-myelin T cells and Abs during the pathogenesis of EAE could
establish a more ideal EAE model.

Oxidative stress is increasingly implicated as a co-factor of tissue injury in
inflammatory/demyelinating disorders of the central nervous system (CNS), such as
multiple sclerosis (MS). While rodent experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis
(EAE) models diverge from human demyelinating disorders with respect to limited
oxidative injury, we observed that in a non-human primate (NHP) model for MS,
namely EAE in the common marmoset, key pathological features of the disease were 
recapitulated, including oxidative tissue injury. Here, we investigated the
presence of oxidative injury in another NHP EAE model, i.e. in rhesus macaques,
which yields an acute demyelinating disease, which may more closely resemble
acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) than MS. Rhesus monkey EAE diverges
from marmoset EAE by abundant neutrophil recruitment into the CNS and destructive
injury to white matter. This difference prompted us to investigate to which
extent the oxidative pathway features elicited in MS and marmoset EAE are
reflected in the acute rhesus monkey EAE model. The rhesus EAE brain was
characterized by widespread demyelination and active lesions containing numerous 
phagocytic cells and to a lesser extent T cells. We observed induction of the
oxidative stress pathway, including injury, with a predilection of p22phox
expression in neutrophils and macrophages/microglia. In addition, changes in iron
were observed. These results indicate that pathogenic mechanisms in the rhesus
EAE model may differ from the marmoset EAE and MS brain due to the neutrophil
involvement, but may in the end lead to similar induction of oxidative stress and
injury.

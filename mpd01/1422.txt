Systems-level identification and analysis of cellular circuits in the brain will 
require the development of whole-brain imaging with single-cell resolution. To
this end, we performed comprehensive chemical screening to develop a whole-brain 
clearing and imaging method, termed CUBIC (clear, unobstructed brain imaging
cocktails and computational analysis). CUBIC is a simple and efficient method
involving the immersion of brain samples in chemical mixtures containing
aminoalcohols, which enables rapid whole-brain imaging with single-photon
excitation microscopy. CUBIC is applicable to multicolor imaging of fluorescent
proteins or immunostained samples in adult brains and is scalable from a primate 
brain to subcellular structures. We also developed a whole-brain cell-nuclear
counterstaining protocol and a computational image analysis pipeline that,
together with CUBIC reagents, enable the visualization and quantification of
neural activities induced by environmental stimulation. CUBIC enables time-course
expression profiling of whole adult brains with single-cell resolution.

West Nile virus (WNV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that infects humans and
other mammals. In some cases WNV causes severe neurological disease. During
recent years, outbreaks of WNV are increasing in worldwide distribution and novel
genetic variants of the virus have been detected. Although a substantial amount
of data exists on WNV infections in rodent models, little is known about early
events during WNV infection in primates, including humans. To gain a deeper
understanding of this process, we performed experimental infections of rhesus
macaques and common marmosets with a virulent European WNV strain (WNV-Ita09) and
monitored virological, hematological, and biochemical parameters. WNV-Ita09
productively infected both monkey species, with higher replication and wider
tissue distribution in common marmosets compared to rhesus macaques. The animals 
in this study however, did not develop clinical signs of WNV disease, nor showed 
substantial deviations in clinical laboratory parameters. In both species, the
virus induced a rapid CD56dimCD16bright natural killer response, followed by IgM 
and IgG antibody responses. The results of this study show that healthy rhesus
macaques and common marmosets are promising animal models to study WNV-Ita09
infection. Both models may be particularly of use to evaluate potential vaccine
candidates or to investigate WNV pathogenesis.

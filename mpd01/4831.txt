Plasmodium knowlesi in the marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).

Langhorne J, Cohen S.

Common marmosets were shown to be susceptible to Plasmodium knowlesi malaria. The
morphology of the parasite was indistinguishable from the observed in the natural
host (Macaca fascicularis) and the common laboratory model (Macaca mulatta). A
differential susceptibility to P. knowlesi was observed in the 8 marmosets
studied. Multiplication rates of parasites were variable over 24 h periods. Five 
animals died of a fulminating infection within 12--17 days after challenge. Three
animals recovered spontaneously from infection and were subsequently resistant to
challenge with homologous and heterologous variants and strains of P. knowlesi.
This resistance was maintained for intervals up to 100 days between challenge
infections.

Argentine hemorrhagic fever: a primate model.

Weissenbacher MC, Calello MA, Colillas OJ, Rondinone SN, Frigerio MJ.

Experimental Junin virus infection of a New World primate, Callithrix jacchus,
was evaluated. The virus produced anorexia, loss of weight, thrombocytopenia,
leukopenia, and hemorrhagic and neurological symptoms and terminated in death.
Virus was recovered from urine, blood samples and all tissues taken at autopsy.
These preliminary observations show that several aspects of the experimental
disease in C. jacchus are quite similar to severe natural Argentine hemorrhagic
fever of man.

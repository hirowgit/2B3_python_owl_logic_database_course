Cynomolgus macaque (Macaca fascicularis) and common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus)
have been widely used in human biomedical research. Long-standing primate genome 
assemblies used the human genome as a reference for ordering and orienting the
assembled fragments into chromosomes. Here we performed de novo genome assembly
of these two species without any human genome-based bias observed in the genome
assemblies released earlier. We assembled PacBio long reads, and the resultant
contigs were scaffolded with Hi-C data, which were further refined based on Hi-C 
contact maps and alternate de novo assemblies. The assemblies achieved scaffold
N50 lengths of 149 Mb and 137 Mb for cynomolgus macaque and common marmoset,
respectively. The high fidelity of our assembly is also ascertained by BAC-end
concordance in common marmoset. Our assembly of cynomolgus macaque outperformed
all the available assemblies of this species in terms of contiguity. The
chromosome-scale genome assemblies produced in this study are valuable resources 
for non-human primate models and provide an important baseline in human
biomedical research.

BACKGROUND: Callitrichids comprise a diverse group of platyrrhine monkeys that
are present across South and Central America. Their secondarily evolved small
size and pointed claws allow them to cling to vertical trunks of a large
diameter. Within callitrichids, lineages with a high affinity for vertical
supports often engage in trunk-to-trunk leaping. This vertical clinging and
leaping (VCL) differs from horizontal leaping (HL) in terms of the functional
demands imposed on the musculoskeletal system, all the more so as HL often occurs
on small compliant terminal branches. We used quantified shape descriptors (3D
geometric morphometrics) and phylogenetically-informed analyses to investigate
the evolution of the shape and size of the humerus and femur, and how this
variation reflects locomotor behavior within Callitrichidae.
RESULTS: The humerus of VCL-associated species has a narrower trochlea compared
with HL species. It is hypothesized that this contributes to greater elbow
mobility. The wider trochlea in HL species appears to correspondingly provide
greater stability to the elbow joint. The femur in VCL species has a smaller head
and laterally-oriented distal condyles, possibly to reduce stresses during
clinging. Similarly, the expanded lesser trochanters visible in VCL species
provide a greater lever for the leg retractors and are thus also interpreted as
an adaptation to clinging. Evolutionary rate shifts to faster shape and size
changes of humerus and femur occurred in the Leontocebus clade when a shift to
slower rates occurred in the Saguinus clade.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on the study of evolutionary rate shifts, the transition to
VCL behavior within callitrichids (specifically the Leontocebus clade) appears to
have been an opportunity for radiation, rather than a specialization that imposed
constraints on morphological diversity. The study of the evolution of
callitrichids suffers from a lack of comparative analyses of limb mechanics
during trunk-to-trunk leaping, and future work in this direction would be of
great interest.

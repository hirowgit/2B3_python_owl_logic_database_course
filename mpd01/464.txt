Animal personality, consistent interindividual differences in behavior through
time, has been intensively studied across animal taxa and particularly in
nonhuman primates. Two different methods have been used to study personality:
questionnaires filled out by trusted raters, following the research tradition in 
human personality psychology, and behavioral observations or testing, based on
the behavioral ecology research tradition. Systematic research of cross-method
validity has, however, brought equivocal results. Here we report a systematic
method comparison with strict validation criteria in common marmosets (Callithrix
jacchus). We compared questionnaire data, observational behavioral data, and
experimentally assessed behavioral data independently collected in two different 
research laboratories and across two years. Notably, we constructed a priori
predictions on the degree and direction of correlations between the
questionnaire-derived constructs and behaviorally derived constructs/variables.
Convergent validity of the constructs/variables was present but was not found in 
both laboratories for any of the constructs. Discriminant validity was found to
some degree for all constructs in both laboratories, with important exceptions.
It seems that marmoset personality structure obtained with descriptor ratings
does not consistently capture the predicted behavioral variables. Our finding
that these two methods do not quite reach common ground thus urges caution in the
choice of the suitable methods to study personality in nonhuman primates. We
discuss the directions to which animal personality research should go so that it 
can get the "best of both worlds." (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all

Specialization of the left and right hemispheres to control behavioural responses
may represent one of the mechanisms underlying individual differences in
personality structure, as well as the preferential use of one hand. The present
study investigated the relationship between personality and hand preference in
common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus), a little New World monkey that presents
highly consistent and stable individual hand preferences for simple reaching. To 
address this issue, data on 56 different behaviours from the species' behavioural
repertoire were measured in 10 different laboratory tests and during observations
under social conditions on 16 adult common marmosets. Stable behavioural
variables were aggregated a priori into 13 personality traits. Exploratory Factor
Analysis (EFA) on personality traits was carried out to verify the presence of
major personality factors, and their relationship with direction and strength of 
individual hand preferences was assessed by multiple regression, taking into
account sex and age of the subjects. The largest number of species-specific
behaviours so far investigated in this species was taken into account and robust 
temporal stability between two testing periods was verified. We confirm that
common marmosets are characterized by specific and stable personality profiles. A
single personality factor, accounting for about 38% of the total variance, was
found by EFA, that describes the interest towards unusual and new experiences and
resembles the human Openness domain. The strength of the hand preference was
found to be predicted by this personality factor, that we named Inquisitiveness. 
Present results highlight common marmoset as a useful primate model for the study
of the relationship between personality and lateralization.

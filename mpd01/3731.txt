BACKGROUND: The cardiac-like musculature is distributed not only in the heart
wall but also in the intrapulmonary venous wall in a few species of insectivores.
It has been suggested that the evolutionary origin of venous cardiac-like
musculature may be traceable to a basic stock of certain mammalian lines of
descent. So, it is important to clarify whether the musculature may be a common
structure in lower mammals from insectivores to primates and to examine the
functional significance of the structure.
METHODS: The distribution of cardiac-like musculature in the intrapulmonary
venous wall of the long-clawed shrew (Sorex unguiculatus), common tree shrew
(Tupaia glis), and common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) was observed by light and
electron microscopy. The presence of atrial natriuretic polypeptide (ANP) was
examined in the musculature by immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: All three species contained cardiac-like myocytes in the tunica media of
intrapulmonary venous wall. In the common tree shrew and the common marmoset,
cardiac-like musculature was found in the small intrapulmonary vein of 150-200
microns in diameter, while, in the long-clawed shrew, it was distributed even in 
the intrapulmonary vein of 30 microns in diameter. Ultrastructure of myocytes was
fundamentally similar to that of atrial myocytes in the long-clawed shrew and the
common tree shrew. The presence of atrial natriuretic polypeptide (ANP) was also 
demonstrated by immunohistochemistry in the intrapulmonary venous walls of common
tree shrews.
CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that the pulmonary venous cardiac-like
musculature occurs in the lower eutherian mammals from insectivores to primitive 
primates. The musculature is thought to act as a regulatory pump in pulmonary
circulation and as an endocrine apparatus of ANP.

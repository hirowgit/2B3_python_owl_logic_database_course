The core functional organization of the primate brain is remarkably conserved
across the order, but behavioral differences evident between species likely
reflect derived modifications in the underlying neural processes. Here, we
performed the first study to directly compare visual recognition memory in two
primate species-rhesus macaques and marmoset monkeys-on the same visual
preferential looking task as a first step toward identifying similarities and
differences in this cognitive process across the primate phylogeny. Preferences
in looking behavior on the task were broadly similar between the species, with
greater looking times for novel images compared with repeated images as well as a
similarly strong preference for faces compared with other categories.
Unexpectedly, we found large behavioral differences among the two species in
looking behavior independent of image familiarity. Marmosets exhibited longer
looking times, with greater variability compared with macaques, regardless of
image content or familiarity. Perhaps most strikingly, marmosets shifted their
gaze across the images more quickly, suggesting a different behavioral strategy
when viewing images. Although such differences limit the comparison of
recognition memory across these closely related species, they point to
interesting differences in the mechanisms underlying active vision that have
significant implications for future neurobiological investigations with these two
nonhuman primate species. Elucidating whether these patterns are reflective of
species or broader phylogenetic differences (e.g., between New World and Old
World monkeys) necessitates a broader sample of primate taxa from across the
Order.

MD-3 is a novel anti-human ICAM-1 monoclonal antibody that induces T cell
tolerance in humanized mice via modulation of dendritic cell differentiation and 
efficiently suppresses the development of collagen-induced arthritis. This effect
has also been observed in xenograft rejection in nonhuman primates, where grafts 
survived for more than 2.5 years following MD-3 administration. Here, we show
that MD-3 can attenuate experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) that was 
induced in common marmoset monkeys by immunization with human myelin
oligodendrocyte glycoproteins. MD-3 administration was initiated 1 week after
immunization and efficiently delayed the development of EAE phenotypes, although 
the disease was not completely prevented. Based on the results of
histopathological examination, MD-3 treatment greatly suppressed total
inflammation with respect to demyelination, as well as T cell and microglial
infiltration in the brain. However, the antibody response against myelin
oligodendrocyte glycoprotein was not suppressed with this treatment protocol.
These observations suggest that the MD-3 antibody has beneficial effects on the
treatment of EAE via the suppression of T cell-mediated cellular responses.

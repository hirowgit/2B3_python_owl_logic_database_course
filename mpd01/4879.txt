The Rete ovarii and follicle formation in marmosets (Callithrix jacchus and
Callithrix penicillata).

Guedes ML, Miraglia T.

The Rete ovarii in young marmosets shows a strong reactivity for a certain number
of enzymes (LDH; NADH2-TR; NADPH2-TR; G-6-PDH; 6-PGDH; alpha-GPDH; beta-OHBDH and
nonspecific esterase). The granulosa cells of the cortical innermost placed
follicles have the same enzymatic reactivity. The germinal epithelium results
negative to the mentioned group of enzymes at this phase of the development. The 
Rete ovarii must play an important r√¥le in the granulosa cells differentiation.

Urinary excretion of biologically active chorionic gonadotrophin by the pregnant 
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus jacchus).

Hobson BM, Hearn JP, Lunn SF, Flockhart JH.

No significant correlation exists between the amount of biologically active
marmoset chorionic gonadotrophin (mCG) in urine and results obtained with an
immunological pregnancy test. The pregnant marmoset excretes large amounts of
oestrogenic steroids, which must be removed, to prevent the enhancement of the
response of the bioassay for mCG. More than 99% of these unconjugated and
conjugated urinary oestrogens can be removed by extraction with acetone and
ether. mCG is excreted throughout pregnancy, maximum levels occurring between the
8th and 9th week of gestation. There is a considerable within- and between-animal
variation in the amount of mCG excreted. However, the pattern of gonadotrophin
excretion by the pregnant marmoset is similar to that of man and the apes but
unlike that of baboons and macaques.

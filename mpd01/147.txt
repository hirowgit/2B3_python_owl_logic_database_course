Episodic memory decline is an early marker of cognitive aging in human. Although 
controversial in animals and called "episodic-like memory", several models have
been successfully developed, however they rarely focused on ageing. While
marmoset is an emerging primate model in aging science, episodic-like memory has 
never been tested in this species and importantly in aged marmosets. Here, we
examined if the recall of the what-when and what-where building blocks of
episodic-like memory declines in ageing marmosets. We developed a naturalistic
approach using spontaneous exploration of real objects by young and old marmosets
in the home cage. We implemented a three-trial task with 1 week inter-trial
interval. Two different sets of identical objects were presented in sample trials
1 and 2, respectively. For the test trial, two objects from each set were
presented in a former position and two in a new one. We quantified the
exploratory behaviour and calculated discrimination indices in a cohort of 20
marmosets. Young animals presented a preserved memory for combined what-where,
and what-when components of the experiment, which declined with aging. These
findings lead one to expect episodic-like memory deficits in aged marmosets.

The accurate and complete assembly of both haplotype sequences of a diploid
organism is essential to understanding the role of variation in genome functions,
phenotypes and diseases1. Here, using a trio-binning approach, we present a
high-quality, diploid reference genome, with both haplotypes assembled
independently at the chromosome level, for the common marmoset (Callithrix
jacchus), an primate model system that is widely used in biomedical research2,3. 
The full spectrum of heterozygosity between the two haplotypes involves 1.36% of 
the genome-much higher than the 0.13% indicated by the standard estimation based 
on single-nucleotide heterozygosity alone. The de novo mutation rate is
0.43 × 10-8 per site per generation, and the paternal inherited genome acquired
twice as many mutations as the maternal. Our diploid assembly enabled us to
discover a recent expansion of the sex-differentiation region and unique
evolutionary changes in the marmoset Y chromosome. In addition, we identified
many genes with signatures of positive selection that might have contributed to
the evolution of Callithrix biological features. Brain-related genes were highly 
conserved between marmosets and humans, although several genes experienced
lineage-specific copy number variations or diversifying selection, with
implications for the use of marmosets as a model system.

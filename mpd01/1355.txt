Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating neurological injury. At present,
pharmacological, regenerative, and rehabilitative approaches are widely studied
as therapeutic interventions for motor recovery after SCI. Preclinical research
has been performed on model animals with experimental SCI, and those studies
often evaluate hand and arm motor function using various indices, such as the
success rate of the single pellet reaching test and the grip force. However,
compensatory movement strategies, involuntary muscle contraction, and the
subject's motivation could affect the scores, resulting in failure to assess
direct recovery from impairment. Identifying appropriate assessments of motor
impairment is thus important for understanding the mechanisms of motor recovery. 
In this study, we developed a motion capture system capable of reconstructing
three-dimensional hand positions with millimeter and millisecond accuracy and
evaluated hand kinematics during food retrieval movement in both healthy and
hemispinalized common marmosets. As a result, the endpoint jerk, representing the
accuracy of hand motor control, was asserted to be an appropriate index of upper 
limb motor impairment by eliminating the influence of the subject's motivation,
involuntary muscle contraction, and compensatory strategies. The result also
suggested that the kinematics of the limb more consistently reflects motor
restoration from deficit due to spinal cord injury than the performance in the
single pellet reaching test. Because of recent attention devoted to the common
marmoset as a nonhuman primate model for human diseases, the present study, which
clarified arm-reaching movements in spinalized marmosets, provides fundamental
knowledge for future therapeutic studies.

BACKGROUND: Nonhuman primates are important for both biomedical studies and
understanding human evolution. Although research in these areas has mostly
focused on Old World primates, such as the rhesus macaque, the common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus), a New World primate, offers important advantages in
comparison to other primates, such as an accelerated lifespan. To conduct Next
Generation expression studies or to study primate evolution, a high quality
annotation of the marmoset genome is required. The availability of marmoset
transcriptome data from five tissues, including both raw sequences and assembled 
transcripts, will aid in the annotation of the newly released marmoset assembly.
FINDINGS: RNA WAS EXTRACTED FROM FIVE TISSUES: skeletal muscle, bladder and
hippocampus from a male common marmoset, and cerebral cortex and cerebellum from 
a female common marmoset. All five RNA samples were sequenced on the Illumina
HiSeq 2000 platform. Sequences were deposited in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive. 
Transcripts were assembled, annotated and deposited in the NCBI Transcriptome
Shotgun Assembly database.
CONCLUSIONS: We have provided a high quality annotation of 51,163 transcripts
with full-length coding sequence. This set represented a total of 10,833 unique
genes. In addition to providing empirical support for the existence of these
10,833 genes, we also provide sequence information for 2,422 genes that were not 
previously identified in the Ensembl annotation of the marmoset genome.

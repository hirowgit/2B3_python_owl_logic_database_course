Cemented annulation as an age criterion in the common marmoset (Callithrix
jacchus).

Stott GG, Sis RF, Levy BM.

Teeth from 18 marmosets, seven months to 5.8 years of age, were studied
histologically. A minimum of one dark and one light band comprised one cemental
annulation. Age was estimated by counting the number of annulations and adding
four months to premolar and eight months to canine teeth for tooth development.
Cemental annulations were most consistent near the gingival border on the labial 
aspect of the tooth. The method will be valuable in estimating the ages of
marmosets and other nonhuman primates.

A stereotaxic x-ray map of the hypothalamus of the marmoset monkey Callithrix
jacchus.

Lipp HP.

Precise hypothalamic surgery in the marmoset monkey Callithrix jacchus cannot be 
performed by means of the Horsley-Clarke stereotaxic procedure. Thus, a simple
stereotaxic X-ray technique was developed. Technical requirements are a
stereotaxic frame for small animals and a dental X-ray source. A sagittal map
shows hypothalamic structures in relation to surrounding bony landmarks.
Corresponding coronal plates allow target determination in that plane.
Intracerebral coordinates based on the position of the optic chiasma can be
transformed into individual Horsley-Clarke coordinates. The error of the atlas is
estimated as +/- 0.25 mm anteroposteriorly, +/- 0.1 mm coronally, and +/- 0.5 mm 
vertically.

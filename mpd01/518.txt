Beginning in late 2016 Brazil faced the worst outbreak of Yellow Fever in recent 
decades, mainly located in southeastern rural regions of the country. In the
present study we characterize the Yellow Fever Virus (YFV) associated with this
outbreak in São Paulo State, Brazil. Blood or tissues collected from 430 dead
monkeys and 1030 pools containing a total of 5,518 mosquitoes were tested for YFV
by quantitative RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and indirect
immunofluorescence. A total of 67 monkeys were YFV-positive and 3 pools yielded
YFV following culture in a C6/36 cell line. Analysis of five nearly full length
genomes of YFV from collected samples was consistent with evidence that the virus
associated with the São Paulo outbreak originated in Minas Gerais. The
phylogenetic analysis also showed that strains involved in the 2016-2017 outbreak
in distinct Brazilian states (i.e., Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro, Espirito Santo)
intermingled in maximum-likelihood and Bayesian trees. Conversely, the strains
detected in São Paulo formed a monophyletic cluster, suggesting that they were
local-adapted. The finding of YFV by RT-PCR in five Callithrix monkeys who were
all YFV-negative by histopathology or immunohistochemistry suggests that this YFV
lineage circulating in Sao Paulo is associated with different outcomes in
Callithrix when compared to other monkeys.

Diffusion MR tractography permits investigating the 3D structure of cortical
pathways as interwoven paths across the entire brain. We use high-resolution
scans from diffusion spectrum imaging and high angular resolution diffusion
imaging to investigate the evolution of cortical pathways within the
euarchontoglire (i.e., primates, rodents) lineage. More specifically, we compare 
cortical fiber pathways between macaques (Macaca mulatta), marmosets (Callithrix 
jachus), and rodents (mice, Mus musculus). We integrate these observations with
comparative analyses of Neurofilament heavy polypeptide (NEFH) expression across 
the cortex of mice and primates. We chose these species because their
phylogenetic position serves to trace the early evolutionary history of the human
brain. Our comparative analysis from diffusion MR tractography, cortical white
matter scaling, and NEFH expression demonstrates that the examined primates
deviate from mice in possessing increased long-range cross-cortical projections, 
many of which course across the anterior to posterior axis of the cortex. Our
study shows that integrating gene expression data with diffusion MR data is an
effective approach in identifying variation in connectivity patterns between
species. The expansion of corticocortical pathways and increased anterior to
posterior cortical integration can be traced back to an extension of neurogenetic
schedules during development in primates.

OBJECTIVES: Platyrrhines span two orders of magnitude in body size and are
characterized by diverse feeding behaviors and diets. While size plays an
important role in primate feeding behavior and masticatory apparatus morphology, 
we know little about size-correlated changes in the force-generating (physiologic
cross-sectional area; PCSA) and excursion/stretch (fiber length; Lf )
capabilities of the jaw-closing muscles in platyrrhines.
METHODS: We examined scaling relationships of the superficial masseter and
temporalis muscles in 21 platyrrhine species. Previous work suggests that larger 
platyrrhines are at a mechanical disadvantage for generating bite forces compared
with smaller platyrrhines. We hypothesize that scaling of jaw-muscle fiber
architecture counters this size-correlated decrease in mechanical advantage.
Thus, we predicted that jaw-muscle PCSAs and muscle weights scale with positive
allometry while Lf s scale with negative allometry, relative to load-arm
estimates for incisor/molar biting and chewing.
RESULTS: Jaw-muscle PCSAs and Lf s appear to scale with negative allometry
relative to load-arm estimates and body size. Negative allometry of jaw-muscle
weights partially accounts for the size-correlated decreases in PCSA and Lf .
Estimates of bite force also scale with negative allometry.
CONCLUSION: Large-bodied platyrrhines (e.g., Alouatta) are at a relative
disadvantage for generating jaw-muscle and bite force as well as jaw-muscle
stretch, compared with smaller species (e.g., Callithrix). The net effect is that
larger platyrrhines likely produce relatively smaller maximal bite forces
compared with smaller taxa. Relative to small- and intermediate-sized
platyrrhines, large-bodied platyrrhines feed on some of the least mechanically
challenging foods, consistent with the size-correlated decrease in relative
muscle and bite forces across the clade. Am J Phys Anthropol, 2015. © 2015 Wiley

Japanese macaques are able to learn how to use rakes to take food after only a
few weeks of training. Since tool-use training induced rapid morphological
changes in some restricted brain areas, this system will be a good model for
studying the neural basis of plasticity in human brains. To examine the
mechanisms of tool-use associated brain expansion on the molecular and cellular
level, here, we performed comprehensive analysis of gene expressions with
microarray. We identified various transcripts showing differential expression
between trained and untrained monkeys in the region around the lateral and
intraparietal sulci. Among candidates, we focused on genes related to synapse
formation and function. Using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain
reaction and histochemical analysis, we confirmed at least three genes (ADAM19,
SPON2, and WIF1) with statistically different expression levels in neurons and
glial cells. Comparative analysis revealed that tool use-associated genes were
more obviously expressed in macaque monkeys than marmosets or mice. Thus, our
findings suggest that cognitive tasks induce structural changes in the neocortex 
via gene expression, and that learning-associated genes innately differ with
relation to learning ability.

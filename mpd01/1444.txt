Compassionate caretaking behaviour towards dying adult group members has been
reported as being unique to humans and chimpanzees. Here we describe in detail
the reaction of a wild dominant male common marmoset, a neotropical primate, to
the accidental death of the dominant female of its group. The male exhibited
behaviours towards the dying female that resembled those of chimpanzees and
humans. The long-term relationship between the dominant pair (which lasted at
least 3.5 years) and their social status in the group may have contributed to the
male's behavioural response. The male prevented young individuals from
approaching the dying female, behaviour previously observed in chimpanzees. The
data provide an interesting insight into compassionate caretaking behaviours in
New World primates as well as the pair-bond systems of common marmosets. These
are rare observations, and thus their detailed descriptions are essential if we
are to create a comparative and enhanced understanding of human and nonhuman
primate thanatology.

We review here the distribution of S-cone signals and properties of S-cone
recipient receptive fields in subcortical pathways. Nearly everything we know
about S-cone signals in the subcortical visual system comes from the study of
visual systems in cats and primates (monkeys); in this review, we concentrate on 
results from macaque and marmoset monkeys. We discuss segregation of S-cone
recipient (blue-on and blue-off) receptive fields in the dorsal lateral
geniculate nucleus and describe their receptive field properties. We treat in
some detail the question of detecting weak S-cone signals as an introduction for 
newcomers to the field. Finally, we briefly consider the question on how S-cone
signals are distributed among nongeniculate targets.

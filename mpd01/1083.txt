Next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have been rapidly applied in
biomedical and biological research in recent years. To provide the comprehensive 
NGS resource for the research, in this paper , we have considered 10
loci/codi/repeats TAGA, TCAT, GAAT, AGAT, AGAA, GATA, TATC, CTTT, TCTG and TCTA. 
Then we developed the NGS Tandem Repeat Database (TandemRepeatDB) for all the
chromosomes of Homo sapiens, Callithrix jacchus, Chlorocebus sabaeus, Gorilla
gorilla, Macaca fascicularis, Macaca mulatta, Nomascus leucogenys, Pan
troglodytes, Papio anubis and Pongo abelii genome data sets for all those locis. 
We find the successive occurence frequency for all the above 10 SSR (simple
sequence repeats) in the above genome data sets on a chromosome-by-chromosome
basis with multiple pattern 2° shaft multicore string matching.

Developments in microfabrication technology have enabled the production of neural
electrode arrays with hundreds of closely spaced recording sites, and electrodes 
with thousands of sites are under development. These probes in principle allow
the simultaneous recording of very large numbers of neurons. However, use of this
technology requires the development of techniques for decoding the spike times of
the recorded neurons from the raw data captured from the probes. Here we present 
a set of tools to solve this problem, implemented in a suite of practical,
user-friendly, open-source software. We validate these methods on data from the
cortex, hippocampus and thalamus of rat, mouse, macaque and marmoset,
demonstrating error rates as low as 5%.

A safe means of anaesthetizing common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) for a study 
using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to investigate cerebral ischaemia was
required. Continuous infusion of alphaxalone/alphadalone was used to anaesthetize
37 marmosets for non-recovery and recovery experiments. This was found to give
safe, reliable anaesthesia when coupled with pulse oximetry and
electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring.

A number of neurobehavioral methods have been developed to test behavior in
marmoset monkeys. These test systems are (1) the bungalow test, which quantifies 
spontaneous explorative behavior, (2) the hand-eye coordination test, which tests
a learned task of coordinated motor behavior, and (3) the fear-potentiated
startle response, which tests and quantifies pathological anxiety manifested by a
response of fright. The test systems are extensively discussed, and the value of 
these test systems is exemplified by applying them to neurological disorders to
register disease activity and drug efficacy.

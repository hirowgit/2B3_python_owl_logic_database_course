PURPOSE: We demonstrated that eyes of young animals of various species (chick,
tree shrew, marmoset, and rhesus macaque) can shorten in the axial dimension in
response to myopic defocus.
METHODS: Chicks wore positive or negative lenses over one eye for 3 days. Tree
shrews were measured during recovery from induced myopia after 5 days of
monocular deprivation for 1 to 9 days. Marmosets were measured during recovery
from induced myopia after monocular deprivation, or wearing negative lenses over 
one or both eyes, or from wearing positive lenses over one or both eyes. Rhesus
macaques were measured after recovery from induced myopia after monocular
deprivation, or wearing negative lenses over one or both eyes. Axial length was
measured with ultrasound biometry in all species.
RESULTS: Tree shrew eyes showed a strong trend to shorten axially to compensate
for myopic defocus. Of 34 eyes that recovered from deprivation-induced myopia for
various durations, 30 eyes (88%) shortened, whereas only 7 fellow eyes shortened.
In chicks, eyes wearing positive lenses reduced their rate of ocular elongation
by two-thirds, including 38.5% of eyes in which the axial length became shorter
than before. Evidence of axial shortening in rhesus macaque (40%) and marmoset
(6%) eyes also occurred when exposed to myopic defocus, although much less
frequently than that in eyes of tree shrews. The axial shortening was caused
mostly by the reduction in vitreous chamber depth.
CONCLUSIONS: Eyes of chick, tree shrew, marmoset, and rhesus macaque can shorten 
axially when presented with myopic defocus, whether the myopic defocus is created
by wearing positive lenses, or is the result of axial elongation of the eye
produced by prior negative lens wear or deprivation. This eye shortening
facilitates compensation for the imposed myopia. Implications for human myopia
control are significant.

Cerebral blood flow (CBF) is the most common parameter for the quantification of 
brain's function. Literature data indicate a widespread dispersion of values that
might be related to some differences in the measurement conditions that are not
properly taken into account in CBF evaluation. Using recent high-resolution
imaging of the complete cortical microvasculature of primate brain, we perform
extensive numerical evaluation of the cerebral perfusion. We show that blood
perfusion associated with intravascular tracers should be normalized by the
surface of the voxel rather than by its volume and we consistently test this
result on the available literature data.

PURPOSE: The authors sought to identify cell surface markers of photoreceptor and
its precursor cells.
METHODS: The expression of surface CD antigens that label both temporally and
spatially distinct populations of mouse retinal cells were examined. Of the
antibodies that showed positive signals in retinal cells, CD73 was focused on for
more detailed analyses.
RESULTS: Mouse retinal subpopulations that expressed CD73 first appeared around
birth and subsequently increased dramatically in number, eventually representing 
more than 90% of the retinal cells in the adult. CD73(+) cells were postmitotic
and mostly rhodopsin-negative at postnatal day 1. However, in the adult retina,
most of these cells expressed rhodopsin but not s-opsin. In reaggregation
cultures, CD73(+) cells differentiated into rhodopsin-positive cells more rapidly
than CD73(-) cells, which supports the idea that CD73 is an early photoreceptor
lineage marker. The effects of ectopic expression in retinal cells of Nrl and
Crx, both of which are transcription factors known to be expressed in
photoreceptor lineage, suggest that CD73 is genetically downstream of Crx in the 
rod cell differentiation lineage. Adult retina of the common marmoset monkey also
showed correlation of the expression pattern of rhodopsin and CD73.
CONCLUSIONS: CD73 is a cell surface marker of cone/rod common precursors and
mature rod cells in mice and is genetically localized between Nrl and Crx. The
expression of CD73 was conserved in primate rod cells, and CD73 provides an
useful tool to purify photoreceptor cells for transplantation aimed at the
regeneration of photoreceptors.

GBV-B induces hepatitis in tamarins and marmosets and is a surrogate model for
HCV infections. Here, we cloned and characterized the antiviral activity of
tamarin and marmoset interferon (IFN)alpha and IFN gamma. Potent antiviral
activity was observed for tamarin and marmoset IFN alpha in primary hepatocyte
cultures infected with GBV-B. The antiviral activity was greater in cultures
exposed to IFN alpha prior to GBV-B infection, suggesting that either GBV-B was
capable of inhibition of the antiviral activity of exogenous IFN alpha or that
the preexisting endogenous IFN response to the virus reduced efficacy to
exogenous IFN alpha. IFN gamma also exhibited antiviral activity in GBV-B
infected hepatocytes. The transcriptional response to IFN alpha in marmoset
hepatocytes was characterized using human genome microarrays. Since the GBV-B
hepatocyte culture model possesses a functional innate immune response, it will
provide opportunities to explore the nature of the antiviral response to a virus 
closely related to HCV.

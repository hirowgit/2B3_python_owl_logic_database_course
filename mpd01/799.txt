Major depression is a psychiatric disorder with high prevalence in the general
population, with increasing expression in adolescence, about 14% in young people.
Frequently, it presents as a chronic condition, showing no remission even after
several pharmacological treatments and persisting in adult life. Therefore,
distinct protocols and animal models have been developed to increase the
understanding of this disease or search for new therapies. To this end, this
study investigated the effects of chronic social isolation and the potential
antidepressant action of nortriptyline in juvenile Callithrix jacchus males and
females by monitoring fecal cortisol, body weight, and behavioral parameters and 
searching for biomarkers and a protocol for inducing depression. The purpose was 
to validate this species and protocol as a translational model of juvenile
depression, addressing all domain criteria of validation: etiologic, face,
functional, predictive, inter-relational, evolutionary, and population. In both
sexes and both protocols (IDS and DPT), we observed a significant reduction in
cortisol levels in the last phase of social isolation, concomitant with increases
in autogrooming, stereotyped and anxiety behaviors, and the presence of
anhedonia. The alterations induced by chronic social isolation are characteristic
of the depressive state in non-human primates and/or in humans, and were reversed
in large part by treatment with an antidepressant drug (nortriptyline).
Therefore, these results indicate C. jacchus as a potential translational model
of juvenile depression by addressing all criteria of validation.

:  Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania sp. are important protozoan parasites for
humans and animals in the Americas, causing Chagas disease and cutaneous or
visceral leishmaniasis, respectively. These vector-borne diseases affect
permanent and transient populations in developing tropical countries that exhibit
favorable conditions for the perpetuation of the parasite cycle. Our objective
was to investigate the occurrence of infection with these parasites in wild
animals from urban rainforest fragments in the city of Salvador, the largest city
in the northeast region of Brazil. Sixty-five wild animals were captured,
clinically examined, and sampled for parasite detection by PCR and culture. Ten
different mammalian genera were identified, being 58% (38/65) marsupials. The
prevalence of T. cruzi and Leishmania sp. infections was 13% and 43%,
respectively. Both parasites were detected by PCR in 11% (7/65), three of which
were also double infected as determined by culture. Among the 28 animals found
infected with at least one parasite (43%, 28/65), 68% (19/28) were marsupials,
two specimens were Callithrix sp. (7%), and one was Trinomys sp. (3%). Most
infected animals (89%) had no clinical signs of disease. We found that healthy
free-living animals from urban rainforest fragments harbored pathogenic
trypanosomatids and should be included in epidemiology studies of diseases in big
cities in tropical countries, as these cities grow and engulf rainforest
remnants.

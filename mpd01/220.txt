Age-related changes in the human testis may include morphological alterations,
disturbed steroidogenesis, and impaired spermatogenesis. However, the specific
impact of cell age remains poorly understood and difficult to assess. Testicular 
peritubular cells fulfill essential functions, including sperm transport,
contributions to the spermatogonial stem cell niche, and paracrine interactions
within the testis. To study their role in age-associated decline of testicular
functions, we performed comprehensive proteome and secretome analyses of
repeatedly passaged peritubular cells from Callithrix jacchus. This nonhuman
primate model better reflects the human testicular biology than rodents and
further gives access to young donors unavailable from humans. Among 5095
identified proteins, 583 were differentially abundant between samples with low
and high passage numbers. The alterations indicate a reduced ability of senescent
peritubular cells to contract and secrete proteins, as well as disturbances in
nuclear factor (NF)-κB signaling and a reduced capacity to handle reactive oxygen
species. Since this in vitro model may not exactly mirror all molecular aspects
of in vivo aging, we investigated the proteomes and secretomes of testicular
peritubular cells from young and old donors. Even though the age-related
alterations at the protein level were less pronounced, we found evidence for
impaired protein secretion, altered NF-κB signaling, and reduced contractility of
these in vivo aged peritubular cells.

While task-dependent changes have been demonstrated in auditory cortex for a
number of behavioral paradigms and mammalian species, less is known about how
behavioral state can influence neural coding in the midbrain areas that provide
auditory information to cortex. We measured single-unit activity in the inferior 
colliculus (IC) of common marmosets of both sexes while they performed a
tone-in-noise detection task and during passive presentation of identical task
stimuli. In contrast to our previous study in the ferret IC, task engagement had 
little effect on sound-evoked activity in central (lemniscal) IC of the marmoset.
However, activity was significantly modulated in noncentral fields, where
responses were selectively enhanced for the target tone relative to the
distractor noise. This led to an increase in neural discriminability between
target and distractors. The results confirm that task engagement can modulate
sound coding in the auditory midbrain, and support a hypothesis that subcortical 
pathways can mediate highly trained auditory behaviors.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT
While the cerebral cortex is widely viewed as playing an essential role in the
learning and performance of complex auditory behaviors, relatively little
attention has been paid to the role of brainstem and midbrain areas that process 
sound information before it reaches cortex. This study demonstrates that the
auditory midbrain is also modulated during behavior. These modulations amplify
task-relevant sensory information, a process that is traditionally attributed to 
cortex.

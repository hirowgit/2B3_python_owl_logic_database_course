Due to the ecological importance and given the scarcity of studies on the
digestive morphology of primates, anatomical aspects of the body and digestive
tract, as well as food content were analysed for marmosets Callithrix sp.
(hybrids of exotic species) captured in forest fragments in Minas Gerais -
Brazil, during the dry and rainy seasons, considering that seasonal variations
affect the availability of food and quality of diet. Data such as body weight and
length, and thoracic and abdominal perimeters were analysed, and no significant
difference was found between dry and rainy seasons. In relation to the digestive 
tract, length, weight and diameter of the oesophagus, stomach, small intestine
and large intestine were measured, in addition to the isolated caecum. There was 
a significant difference in the diameter of the ascending colon, which was larger
in the animals in the dry season than in the rainy season. The difference found
may be related to diet, and through analysis of the gastric and caecal contents, 
it was observed that gum was the main food item for the dry season marmosets,
while in the rainy season the animals consumed mainly arthropods. Thus, the
characteristic observed in the digestive tract of dry season marmosets is a
reflection of an adaptive response to gum intake, since this food item is of low 
digestibility, necessitating that the food content be retained for a long time in
this segment of the large intestine, helping the process of microbial
fermentation and better energy utilization for these animals.

While pregnancy-related proteins (PRP) are known to contribute to immunotolerance
during pregnancy, their significance to development of invasive placenta is
unclear. We compared PRP expression in humans and the common marmoset (Callithrix
jacchus), a new-world monkey. Invasive placenta was observed at the
maternal-foetal interface of marmoset placenta from green fluorescent protein
(GFP)-expressing foetus and wild type mother. The pregnancy zone protein (PZP)
and alpha-2 macroglobulin-like 1 (A2ML1) proteins exhibited the most prominent
increase in expression during the second trimester in humans and marmoset,
respectively. In humans, PZP accumulated at the maternal-foetal interface and
A2ML1 accumulated in the amnion. Similarly, A2ML1 mRNA was detected in marmoset
placenta. These proteins belong to the A2M family of protease inhibitors, and
both PZP and A2ML1 share around 90% homology between human and marmoset and have 
highly conserved structures. However, the protease-reacting bait regions of the
proteins had lower homology (56.8-60.7% in proteins) relative to the rest of the 
sequence. Notably, the cleavage site of a proinflammatory proline-endopeptidase
was preserved in human PZP and marmoset A2ML1. These proteins contain multiple
sites that are cleaved by proteases involving proline-endopeptidase. Systemic
regulation of these A2M family proteins may be important in animals with invasive
placenta.

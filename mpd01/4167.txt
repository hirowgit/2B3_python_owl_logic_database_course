In leishmaniasis, the search for a suitable experimental animal model is highly
recommended, especially in Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis (L. (V) b) research.
Diverse species of neotropical primates have increasingly been used as
experimental hosts of Leishmania. This article describes aspects of parasite
L(V)b and marmoset, Callithrix penicillata (Primates, Callithricidae),
interaction and summarizes the biology of parasitism in this primate model.
Results of recent studies on primary infections with several strains of L(V)b as 
well as parasitism evolution, clinical outcome patterns and immunoprotection
experiments, are summarily discussed. The relevance of homologous reinfection
experiments for vaccine development in leishmaniasis is discussed.

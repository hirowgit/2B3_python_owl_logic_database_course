Transplantation of pig islet cells for the treatment of diabetes may be a more
effective approach compared with the application of insulin. However, before
introduction into the clinic, efficacy and safety of this treatment have to be
shown. Non-human primate models may be used for this, despite the fact that they 
are characterised by several limitations. Here we investigate the prevalence of
porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERVs), which are present in the genome of all
pigs and which may infect human cells, as well as of porcine herpes viruses in
donor pigs and their potential transmission to non-human primate recipients.
Despite the fact that all three subtypes of PERV were present in all and porcine 
cytomegalovirus (PCMV) was found in some of the pigs, neither PERVs nor PCMV were
found in the recipient animals under the experimental conditions applied. Porcine
lymphotropic herpes viruses (PLHV) were not found in the donor pigs, hepatitis E 
virus (HEV) was not found in the recipients.

The close immunological and physiological resemblance with humans makes non-human
primates a valuable model for studying influenza virus pathogenesis and immunity 
and vaccine efficacy against infection. Although both cynomolgus and rhesus
macaques are frequently used in influenza virus research, a direct comparison of 
susceptibility to infection and disease has not yet been performed. In the
current study a head-to-head comparison was made between these species, by using 
a recently described swine-origin pandemic H1N1 strain, A/Mexico/InDRE4487/2009. 
In comparison to rhesus macaques, cynomolgus macaques developed significantly
higher levels of virus replication in the upper airways and in the lungs,
involving both peak level and duration of virus production, as well as higher
increases in body temperature. In contrast, clinical symptoms, including
respiratory distress, were more easily observed in rhesus macaques. Expression of
sialyl-α-2,6-Gal saccharides, the main receptor for human influenza A viruses,
was 50 to 73 times more abundant in trachea and bronchus of cynomolgus macaques
relative to rhesus macaques. The study also shows that common marmosets, a New
World non-human primate species, are susceptible to infection with pandemic H1N1.
The study results favor the cynomolgus macaque as model for pandemic H1N1
influenza virus research because of the more uniform and high levels of virus
replication, as well as temperature increases, which may be due to a more
abundant expression of the main human influenza virus receptor in the trachea and
bronchi.

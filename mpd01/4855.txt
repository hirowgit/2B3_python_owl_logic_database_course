Use of the common marmoset, Callithrix jacchus, in reproductive research.

Hearn JP, Abbott DH, Chambers PC, Hodges JK, Lunn SF.

A self-sustaining colony of common marmosets, Callithrix jacchus, was established
for reproductive research. Methods of management were developed to ensure optimal
breeding conditions for marmosets in captivity. Studies of the reproductive
biology and endocrinology of this species suggest that the common marmoset may be
a suitable model for the human in certain aspects of the ovarian cycle,
pregnancy, puberty and the hypothalamic and pituitary control of luteinizing
hormone secretion. The rapid rate of reproduction of C. jacchus in captivity
allows a relatively large colony to be maintained at moderate cost and also makes
this species a most suitable laboratory primate for longer term studies of the
safety and efficacy of new contraceptive methods.

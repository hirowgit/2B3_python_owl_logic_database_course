The claustrum has been the subject of intense research interest in recent years, 
driven in large part by its extensive connections with various regions of the
cerebral cortex and by hypotheses surrounding its possible role in multimodal
sensory and/or sensory-emotional integration. Here we employed neuroanatomical
tracers to map projections from the claustrum-insular region to the medial
prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortex of the common marmoset (Callithrx
jacchus). These areas were selected based on their identification as "hub" areas 
of the default mode and cortical salience networks, respectively. Microinjections
of fluorescent tracers, along with gold-nanoparticle-conjugated cholera toxin
B-subunit and biotinylated dextran amine, were placed in subdivisions of the
anterior cingulate area 24b/c and in medial prefrontal areas 32 and 32V. The
resulting distribution of transported label showed rostral-caudal and
dorsal-ventral topographic arrangement of claustrum connections and clear
rostral-caudal topography of insular projections. Medial prefrontal connections
were restricted mainly to a ventromedial strip located in the rostral half of the
claustrum, with a second, smaller patch of cells in the caudal, ventrolateral
portion. In contrast, injections into area 24 yielded dense, widespread
connections from the dorsal claustrum, extending along its entire rostral-caudal 
length. Projections from the "classical" agranular, disgranular, and granular
insular areas were sparse or nonexistent in areas 32 and 32V, with progressively 
increasing connections observed in more caudal tracer injections (i.e., in
subdivisions of area 24). Transported label was observed in rostral peri-insular 
areas orbital periallocortex, orbital proisocortex, and insular proisocortex
following all prefrontal injections. These data provide a structural connectivity
foundation for interpretation of functional imaging studies, which often indicate
activity in the "anterior insula" that may arise, in part, from claustrum and/or 
peri-insular projections to the anterior cingulate and medial prefrontal
cortices. J. Comp. Neurol. 525:1421-1441, 2017. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Centromere protein B (CENP-B) is one of the major proteins involved in centromere
formation, binding to centromeric repetitive DNA by recognizing a 17 bp motif
called the CENP-B box. Hominids (humans and great apes) carry large numbers of
CENP-B boxes in alpha satellite DNA (AS, the major centromeric repetitive DNA of 
simian primates). Only negative results have been reported regarding the presence
of the CENP-B box in other primate taxa. Consequently, it is widely believed that
the CENP-B box is confined, within primates, to the hominids. We report here that
the common marmoset, a New World monkey, contains an abundance of CENP-B boxes in
its AS. First, in a long contig sequence we constructed and analysed, we
identified the motif in 17 of the 38 alpha satellite repeat units. We then
sequenced terminal regions of additional clones and found the motif in many of
them. Immunostaining of marmoset cells demonstrated that CENP-B binds to DNA in
the centromeric regions of chromosomes. Therefore, functional CENP-B boxes are
not confined to hominids. Our results indicate that the efficiency of
identification of the CENP-B box may depend largely on the sequencing methods
used, and that the CENP-B box in centromeric repetitive DNA may be more common
than researchers previously thought.

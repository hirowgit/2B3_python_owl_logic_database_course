We investigated the viability of a combined repeated dose toxicity study,
including toxicokinetics (TK), in common marmosets according to the ICH-S4,
ICH-S3A and ICH-S7A Guidelines using valsartan as test article whose non-clinical
repeated dose toxicity studies had been conducted using this species for
regulatory purpose. Valsartan was administered orally to 3 animals/sex at 200
mg/kg/day for 2 weeks. In addition to the routine parameters in repeated dose
toxicity studies, safety pharmacology parameters (examinations of the central
nervous, respiratory and cardiovascular systems) were also evaluated. The Plasma 
Micro Sampling Toxicokinetics (PMS-TK) method required ultrasensitive
quantitation, was employed to evaluate the relationship between toxic changes and
plasma concentrations as well as the effects of frequent blood sampling in
individual animals. In valsartan, toxic findings (a deteriorated physical
condition; moribundity of one male and one female on Day 14; sporadic vomitus;
decreases in body weights and food consumption; decreases in erythrocytic
parameters; and renal changes such as an increase in urea nitrogen, dilation of
the tubules and hypertrophy of the tubular epithelium) were similar and plasma
concentrations comparable to the results in the approval information.
Furthermore, no side effects caused by frequent blood sampling were confirmed in 
the negative control group. Consequently, a combined repeated dose toxicity study
including TK analysis using the PMS-TK method is viable in common marmosets and
contributes to animal welfare.

Fronto-striatal circuitry involving the orbitofrontal cortex has been identified 
as mediating successful reversal of stimulus-outcome contingencies. The region of
the striatum that most contributes to reversal learning remains unclear, with
studies in primates implicating both caudate nucleus and putamen. We trained four
marmosets on a touchscreen-based serial reversal task and implanted each with
cannulae targeting both putamen and caudate bilaterally. This allowed reversible 
inactivation of the two areas within the same monkeys, but across separate
sessions, to directly investigate their respective contributions to reversal
performance. Behavioral sensitivity to the GABAA agonist muscimol varied across
subjects and between brain regions, so each marmoset received a range of doses.
Intermediate doses of intra-putamen muscimol selectively impaired reversal
performance, leaving the baseline discrimination phase unchanged. There was no
effect of low doses and high doses were generally disruptive. By contrast, low
doses of intra-caudate muscimol improved reversal performance, while high doses
impaired both reversal and baseline discrimination performance. These data
provide evidence for a specific role of the putamen in serial reversal learning, 
which may reflect the more habitual nature of repeated reversals using the same
stimulus pair.

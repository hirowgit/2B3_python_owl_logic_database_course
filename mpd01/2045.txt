The placenta has arisen relatively recently and is among the most rapidly
evolving tissues in mammals. Several different placental barrier and structure
types appear to have independently evolved common functional features. Specific
patterns of gene expression that determine placental development in humans are
predicted to be accompanied by specific profiles of epigenetic modification.
However, the stratification of epigenetic modifications into those involved in
conserved aspects of placental function, versus those involved in divergent
placental features, has yet to begin. As a first step towards this goal, we have 
investigated the methylation status of a small number of gene-specific
methylation events recently identified in human placenta, in a panel of placental
tissue from baboon, marmoset, cow, cat, guinea pig and mouse. These represent
disparate placental barrier types and structures. In this study we hypothesized
that specific epigenetic markings may be associated with placental barrier type
or function, independent of phylogeny. However, in contrast to our predictions,
the majority of gene-specific methylation appears to track with phylogeny,
independent of placental barrier type or other structural features. This suggests
that despite the likelihood of epigenetic modification playing a role in the
functioning and evolution of different placental subtypes, there is no evidence
for an involvement of the gene-specific methylation profiles we have identified, 
in specifying these differences. Further studies, examining larger numbers of
epigenetic modifications across phylogeny, are required to define the role of
specific epigenetic modifications in the evolution of distinct placental
structures.

Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) has the potential to be able to observe
functional tomographic images of neural activity in the brain at millisecond
time-scales. Prior modelling and experimental work has shown that EIT is capable 
of imaging impedance changes from neural depolarisation in rat somatosensory
cortex. Here, we investigate the feasibility of EIT for imaging impedance changes
using a stereotaxically implanted microelectrode array in the thalamus.
Microelectrode array EIT was simulated using an anatomically accurate marmoset
brain model. Impedance imaging was validated and detectability estimated using
physiological noise recorded from the marmoset visual thalamus. The results
suggest that visual-input-driven impedance changes in visual subcortical bodies
within 300 μm of the implanted array could be reliably reconstructed and
localised, comparable to local field potential measurements. Furthermore, we
demonstrated that microelectrode array EIT could reconstruct concurrent activity 
in multiple subcortical bodies simultaneously.

Induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells hold great promise for regenerative medicine
and the treatment of various diseases. Before proceeding to clinical trials, it
is important to test the efficacy and safety of iPS cell-based treatments using
experimental animals. The common marmoset is a new world monkey widely used in
biomedical studies. However, efficient methods that could generate iPS cells from
a variety of cells have not been established. Here, we report that marmoset cells
are efficiently reprogrammed into iPS cells by combining RNA transfection and
chemical compounds. Using this novel combination, we generate transgene
integration-free marmoset iPS cells from a variety of cells that are difficult to
reprogram using conventional RNA transfection method. Furthermore, we show this
is similarly effective for human and cynomolgus monkey iPS cell generation. Thus,
the addition of chemical compounds during RNA transfection greatly facilitates
reprogramming and efficient generation of completely integration-free safe iPS
cells in primates, particularly from difficult-to-reprogram cells.

Common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) are frequently used for biomedical research
but gastrointestinal diseases have been major health problems to maintain captive
marmosets. We have diagnosed a novel gastrointestinal disease in marmosets, as
which we propose to call 'marmoset duodenal dilation syndrome'; this disease is
characterised by proximal duodenal obstruction and dilation. This study aimed to 
reveal the clinical and pathological findings of this syndrome and establish
appropriate diagnostic imaging methods. Animals with the syndrome comprised 21.9%
of the necropsy cases at the Central Institute for Experimental Animals in
Kawasaki, Japan. The syndrome is characterised by clinical signs included
vomiting, bloating, and weight loss. Grossly, all diseased animals exhibited
significant dilation of the descending part of the duodenum, which contained a
mixture of gas and fluid. The duodenal dilations were definitively diagnosed by
contrast radiography. Moreover, a combination of plain radiography and
ultrasonography was found to be a viable screening method for diagnosing duodenal
dilation. The animals with duodenal dilation characteristically showed adhesions 
between the descending duodenum and ascending colon with chronic peritonitis. The
cause of marmoset duodenal dilation syndrome remains unknown, but was likely
multifactorial, including peritoneal adhesion, chronic ulcer, and feeding
conditions in this study.

Treatment of epilepsy remains difficult because patients suffer from
pharmacoresistant forms of the disease and drug side-effects. Thus, there is an
urgent need to identify not only new antiepileptic drug candidates but also novel
epileptic animal models. Here, we characterize seizures induced with kainic acid 
(KA) in the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). Adult marmosets received 0.1,
1, or 10 mg/kg of KA subcutaneously. All animals exhibited early convulsive
behavior (seizure scores of I and II on the Racine scale). Seizure scores were
low at lower KA doses, but the highest dose of KA tested triggered generalized
seizures (scores IV and V on the Racine scale). We next performed preliminary
evaluation of the efficacy of the antiepileptic drug diazepam. This drug at
1 mg/kg (delivered subcutaneously) prevented 10 mg/kg KA-induced stage V
seizures. KA administration to marmosets reliably triggers generalized seizures; 
therefore, the marmoset is a useful animal model in which to analyze the seizures
of a nonhuman primate brain and to develop new treatments for epilepsy.

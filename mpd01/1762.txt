OBJECTIVE: To report normal tear production of healthy adult black-tufted
marmosets and propose a novel alternative for the measurement of the aqueous
portion of tear production in animals with small eyes.
ANIMAL STUDIED: Black-tufted marmosets (Callithrix penicillata).
PROCEDURES: Tear production of 19 animals was evaluated by the following methods:
modified Schirmer's I, phenol red thread and the novel use of standardized
endodontic absorbent paper points. These methods and results were compared.
Additionally, blink frequency and palpebral fissure length were measured.
RESULTS: Modified Schirmer's test I, mean = -0.46 ± 3.41 mm/min; Phenol red
thread, mean = 13.27 ± 5.41 mm/15 s.; Standardized endodontic paper points, size 
30, mean = 9.32 ± 3.09 mm/min; Mean palpebral fissure length = 7.83 ± 0.72 mm.
Blink frequency, mean = 20.27 ± 5.92/5 min.
CONCLUSIONS: Normal parameters for blink frequency, palpebral fissure length and 
tear production measurement are presented. The palpebral fissure of black-tufted 
marmoset is very small and tear production is one of the lowest reported for all 
animal species. A novel and practical alternative for tear production measurement
using standardized endodontic absorbent paper points is presented and is
indicated for animals with small eyes.

We have previously shown that persistent α-synuclein overexpression in ventral
midbrain of marmoset leads to a distinctive neurodegenerative process and motor
defects. The neurodegeneration was confined to caudate putamen dopaminergic
fibers in animals overexpressing wild-type (wt) α-synuclein. However, A53T
α-synuclein overexpression induced neurodegeneration that resulted in nigral
dopaminergic cell death. Here, we analyze the microglia population in the
midbrain of these animals by stereological quantification of Iba1+ cells. Our
data here show that monkeys overexpressing A53T α-synuclein showed a long-term
increase in microglia presenting macrophagic morphology. However, wt α-synuclein 
overexpression, despite the absence of dopaminergic cell death, resulted in a
permanent robust increase of the microglia population characterized by a range of
distinct morphological types that persisted after 1 year. These results confirm
that the microglial response differs depending on the type of α-synuclein
(wt/A53T) and/or whether α-synuclein expression results in cell death or not,
suggesting that microglia may play different roles during disease progression.
Furthermore, the microglial response is modulated by events related to
α-synuclein expression in substantia nigra and persists in the long term. The
data presented here is in agreement with that previously observed in a
recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) α-synuclein rat model, thereby
validating both the findings and the model, and highlighting the translational
potential of the rodent model to higher species closer to humans.

Longitudinal studies are essential to understand healthy and pathological
neurocognitive aging such as Alzheimer's Disease, but longitudinal designs are
rare in both humans and non-human primate models of aging because of the
difficulty of tracking cognitive change in long-lived primates. Common marmosets 
(Callithrix jacchus) are uniquely suited for aging studies due to their naturally
short lifespan (10-12 years), sophisticated cognitive and social abilities and
Alzheimer Disease-like neuropathology. We report the first longitudinal study of 
cognitive aging in marmosets (N = 28) as they transitioned from middle- (∼5
years) to old age (∼9 years). We characterized aging trajectories using reversal 
learning with different stimuli each year. Marmosets initially improved on
cognitive performance due to practice, but worsened in the final year, suggesting
the onset of age-related decline. Cognitive impairment emerged earlier in females
than males and was more prominent for discrimination than for reversal learning. 
Sex differences in cognitive aging could not be explained by differences in
motivation or motor abilities, which improved or remained stable across aging.
Likewise, males and females did not differ in aging trajectories of overall
behavior or reactivity to a social stressor, with the exception of a progressive 
decline in the initiation of social behavior in females. Patterns of cognitive
aging were highly variable across marmosets of both sexes, suggesting the
potential for pathological aging for some individuals. Future work will link
individual cognitive trajectories to neuropathology in order to better understand
the relationships between neuropathologic burden and vulnerability to age-related
cognitive decline in each sex.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the agent of
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is responsible for the worst pandemic of the
21st century. Like all human coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 originated in a wildlife
reservoir, most likely from bats. As SARS-CoV-2 has spread across the globe in
humans, it has spilled over to infect a variety of non-human animal species in
domestic, farm, and zoo settings. Additionally, a broad range of species,
including one neotropical monkey, have proven to be susceptible to experimental
infection with SARS-CoV-2. Together, these findings raise the specter of
establishment of novel enzootic cycles of SARS-CoV-2. To assess the potential
exposure of free-living non-human primates to SARS-CoV-2, we sampled 60
neotropical monkeys living in proximity to Manaus and São José do Rio Preto, two 
hotspots for COVID-19 in Brazil. Our molecular and serological tests detected no 
evidence of SAR-CoV-2 infection among these populations. While this result is
reassuring, sustained surveillance efforts of wildlife living in close
association with human populations is warranted, given the stochastic nature of
spillover events and the enormous implications of SARS-CoV-2 spillover for human 
health.

The "blue-on" and "blue-off" receptive fields in retina and dorsal lateral
geniculate nucleus (LGN) of diurnal primates combine signals from
short-wavelength sensitive (S) cone photoreceptors with signals from medium/long 
wavelength sensitive (ML) photoreceptors. Three questions about this combination 
remain unresolved. Firstly, is the combination of S and ML signals in these cells
linear or non-linear? Secondly, how does the timing of S and ML inputs to these
cells influence their responses? Thirdly, is there spatial antagonism within S
and ML subunits of the receptive field of these cells? We measured contrast
sensitivity and spatial frequency tuning for four types of drifting sine
gratings: S cone isolating, ML cone isolating, achromatic (S + ML), and
counterphase chromatic (S - ML), in extracellular recordings from LGN of marmoset
monkeys. We found that responses to stimuli which modulate both S and ML cones
are well predicted by a linear sum of S and ML signals, followed by a saturating 
contrast-response relation. Differences in sensitivity and timing (i.e. vector
combination) between S and ML inputs are needed to explain the amplitude and
phase of responses to achromatic (S + ML) and counterphase chromatic (S - ML)
stimuli. Best-fit spatial receptive fields for S and/or ML subunits in most cells
(>80%) required antagonistic surrounds, usually in the S subunit. The surrounds
were however generally weak and had little influence on spatial tuning. The
sensitivity and size of S and ML subunits were correlated on a cell-by-cell
basis, adding to evidence that blue-on and blue-off receptive fields are
specialised to signal chromatic but not spatial contrast.

Interest in the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) as a primate model animal
has grown recently, in part due to the successful demonstration of transgenic
marmosets. However, there is some debate as to the suitability of marmosets,
compared to more widely used animal models, such as the macaque monkey and mouse.
Especially, the usage of marmoset for animal models of human cognition and mental
disorders, is still yet to be fully explored. To examine the prospects of the
marmoset model for neuroscience research, the Marmoset Gene Atlas
(https://gene-atlas.bminds.brain.riken.jp/) provides a whole brain gene
expression atlas in the common marmoset. We employ in situ hybridization (ISH) to
systematically analyze gene expression in neonate marmoset brains, which allows
us to compare expression with other model animals such as mouse. We anticipate
that these data will provide sufficient information to develop tools that enable 
us to reveal marmoset brain structure, function, cellular and molecular
organization for primate brain research.

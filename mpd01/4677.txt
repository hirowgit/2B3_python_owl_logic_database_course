Primary structures of adult hemoglobins of silvery marmoset, Callithrix
argentatus, and cotton-headed tamarin, Saguinus oedipus.

Maita T, Hayashida M, Matsuda G.

Tryptic peptides of the alpha and beta chains from silvery marmoset (Callithrix
argentatus) and cotton-headed tamarin (Saguinus oedipus) hemoglobins were
isolated and sequenced, respectively, by conventional methods. The ordering of
the peptides in each chain was deduced from the homology of their sequences with 
those of human adult hemoglobin. The primary structures thus deduced are compared
with those of other primate hemoglobins, and the rate of evolution in New World
monkey hemoglobins is discussed.

The structure of the vomeronasal organ and nasopalatine ducts in Aotus
trivirgatus and some other primate species.

Hunter AJ, Fleming D, Dixson AF.

A vomeronasal organ and patent nasopalatine ducts were found in adult specimens
of Aotus trivirgatus, Arctocebus calabarensis, Ateles geoffroyi and Saguinus
fuscicollis. The vomeronasal complex appeared to be functional except in Ateles. 
However, the relative size of the organ in the Platyrrhini is much reduced
compared to that in prosimians. The possible role of the organ in mediating
neuroendocrine processes in primates is discussed.

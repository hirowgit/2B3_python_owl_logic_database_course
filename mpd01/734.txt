The common marmoset (CM; Callithrix jacchus) is a small New World monkey with a
high rate of pregnancy and is maintained in closed colonies as an experimental
animal species. Although CMs are used for immunological research, such as studies
of autoimmune disease and infectious disease, their immunological characteristics
are less defined than those of other nonhuman primates. We and others have
analyzed antigen recognition-related molecules, the development of hematopoietic 
stem cells (HSCs), and the molecules involved in the immune response. CMs
systemically express Caja-G, a major histocompatibility complex class I molecule,
and the ortholog of HLA-G, a suppressive nonclassical HLA class I molecule. HSCs 
express CD117, while CD34 is not essential for multipotency. CD117+ cells
developed into all hematopoietic cell lineages, but compared with human HSCs, B
cells did not extensively develop when HSCs were transplanted into an
immunodeficient mouse. Although autoimmune models have been successfully
established, sensitization of CMs with some bacteria induced a low protective
immunity. In CMs, B cells were observed in the periphery, but IgG levels were
very low compared with those in humans and mice. This evidence suggests that CM
immunity is partially suppressed systemically. Such immune regulation might
benefit pregnancy in CMs, which normally deliver dizygotic twins, the placentae
of which are fused and the immune cells of which are mixed. In this review, we
describe the CM immune system and discuss the possibility of using CMs as a model
of human immunity.

Animal models have been critical in building evidence that the prenatal
experience and intrauterine environment are capable of exerting profound and
permanent effects on metabolic health through developmental programming of
obesity. However, despite physiological and evolutionary similarities, nonhuman
primate models are relatively rare. The common marmoset monkey ( Callithrix
jacchus) is a New World monkey that has been used as a biomedical model for well 
more than 50 years and has recently been framed as an appropriate model for
exploring early-life impacts on later health and disease. The spontaneous,
multifactorial, and early-life development of obesity in the common marmoset make
it a valuable research model for advancing our knowledge about the role of the
prenatal and placental mechanisms involved in developmental programming of
obesity. This paper provides a brief overview of obesity in the common marmoset, 
followed by a discussion of marmoset reproduction and placental characteristics. 
We then discuss the occurrence and utility of variable intrauterine environments 
in developmental programming in marmosets. Evidence of developmental programming 
of obesity will be given, and finally, we put forward future directions and
innovations for including the placenta in developmental programming of obesity in
the common marmoset.

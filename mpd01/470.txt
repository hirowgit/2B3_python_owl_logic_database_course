The objective of this study is to assess the response of telemetered common
marmosets to multiple cardiac ion channel inhibitors and to clarify the
usefulness of this animal model in evaluating the effects of drug candidates on
electrocardiogram (ECG). Six multiple cardiac ion channel inhibitors (sotalol,
astemizole, flecainide, quinidine, verapamil and terfenadine) were orally
administered to telemetered common marmosets and changes in QTc, PR interval and 
QRS duration were evaluated. Drugs plasma levels were determined to compare the
sensitivity in common marmosets to that in humans. QTc prolongation was observed 
in the marmosets dosed with sotalol, astemizole, flecainide, quinidine, verapamil
and terfenadine. PR prolongation was noted after flecainide and verapamil
administration, and QRS widening occurred following treatment with flecainide and
quinidine. Drugs plasma levels associated with ECG changes in marmosets were
similar to those in humans, except for verapamil-induced QTc prolongation.
Verapamil-induced change is suggested due to body temperature decrease. These
results indicate that telemetered common marmoset is a useful animal for
evaluation of the ECG effects of multiple cardiac ion channel inhibitors and the 
influence of body temperature change should be considered in the assessment.

Genetic variation in the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4) is associated with
vulnerability to affective disorders and pharmacotherapy efficacy. We recently
identified sequence polymorphisms in the common marmoset SLC6A4 repeat region
(AC/C/G and CT/T/C) associated with individual differences in anxiety-like trait,
gene expression, and response to antidepressants. The mechanisms underlying the
effects of these polymorphisms are unknown, but a key mediator of serotonin
action is the serotonin 2A receptor (5HT2A). Thus, we correlated 5HT2A binding
potential (BP) and RNA gene expression in 16 SLC6A4 genotyped marmosets with
responsivity to 5HT2A antagonism during the human intruder test of anxiety.
Voxel-based analysis and RNA measurements showed a reduction in 5HT2A BP and gene
expression specifically in the right posterior insula of individuals homozygous
for the anxiety-related variant AC/C/G. These same marmosets displayed an
anxiogenic, dose-dependent response to the human intruder after 5HT2A
pharmacological antagonism, while CT/T/C individuals showed no effect. A
voxel-based correlation analysis, independent of SLC6A4 genotype, revealed that
5HT2A BP in the adjacent right anterior insula and insula proisocortex was
negatively correlated with trait anxiety scores. Moreover, 5HT2A BP in both
regions was a good predictor of the size and direction of the acute emotional
response to the human intruder threat after 5HT2A antagonism. Our findings
suggest that genetic variation in the SLC6A4 repeat region may contribute to the 
trait anxious phenotype via neurochemical changes in brain areas implicated in
interoceptive and emotional processing, with a critical role for the right insula
5HT2A in the regulation of affective responses to threat.

The primate brain contains a large number of interconnected visual areas, whose
spatial organization and intracortical projections show a high level of
conservation across species. One fiber pathway of recent interest is the vertical
occipital fasciculus (VOF), which is thought to support communication between
dorsal and ventral visual areas in the occipital lobe. A recent comparative
diffusion MRI (dMRI) study reported that the VOF in the macaque brain bears a
similar topology to that of the human, running superficial and roughly
perpendicular to the optic radiation. The present study reports a comparative
investigation of the VOF in the common marmoset, a small New World monkey whose
lissencephalic brain is approximately tenfold smaller than the macaque and
150-fold smaller than the human. High-resolution ex vivo dMRI of two marmoset
brains revealed an occipital white matter structure that closely resembles that
of the larger primate species, with one notable difference. Namely, unlike in the
macaque and the human, the VOF in the marmoset is spatially fused with other,
more anterior vertical tracts, extending anteriorly between the parietal and
temporal cortices. We compare several aspects of this continuous structure, which
we term the VOF complex (VOF +), and neighboring fasciculi to those of macaques
and humans. We hypothesize that the essential topology of the VOF+ is a conserved
feature of the posterior cortex in anthropoid primates, with a clearer
fragmentation into multiple named fasciculi in larger, more gyrified brains.

BACKGROUND: Increased firing across glutamatergic synapses may contribute to both
the motor dysfunction and L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia seen in Parkinson's disease. 
Given their ability to reduce glutamate release, activation of group III
metabotropic glutamate receptors such as metabotropic glutamate receptor 4 may
prove effective against both motor dysfunction and dyskinesia in Parkinson's
disease.
OBJECTIVE: We hypothesised that activation of metabotropic glutamate receptor 4
by an orthosteric agonist
((2S)-2-amino-4-(hydroxy(hydroxy(4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-5-nitrophenyl)methyl)phospho
ryl)butanoic acid, LSP1-2111) would produce antiparkinsonian activity and reduce 
expression of dyskinesia in a 1-methyl-4-phenyl,1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine
(MPTP)-treated marmoset model of Parkinson's disease.
METHODS: Common marmosets were previously treated with MPTP and pre-primed with
L-DOPA for up to 28 days to express dyskinesia. LSP1-2111 (1, 3, or 6 mg/kg s.c.)
or vehicle (0.9% saline s.c.) were administered immediately prior to L-DOPA
(8 mg/kg + benserazide (10 mg/kg) p.o.) or vehicle (10% sucrose p.o.). Locomotor 
activity was measured in automated test cages and animals were scored for
dyskinesia and disability.
RESULTS: As expected, L-DOPA reversed motor disability and induced moderate
dyskinesia. By contrast, LSP1-2111 alone significantly reduced the motor
disability without any accompanying expression of dyskinesia. When administered
in combination with L-DOPA, LSP1-2111 did not significantly reduce the severity
of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia.
CONCLUSION: Systemic administration of LSP1-2111 reduces motor disability without
causing dyskinesia in MPTP-treated marmosets, supporting a role for metabotropic 
glutamate receptor 4 orthosteric agonists as promising monotherapy for PD.
Conversely, this study found no evidence to support their use as antidyskinetic
agents within the dose range tested.

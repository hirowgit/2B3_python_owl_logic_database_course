When offspring share a womb, interactions among fetuses can impart lasting
impressions on phenotypic outcomes. Such intrauterine interactions often are
mediated by sex steroids (estrogens and androgens) produced by the developing
fetuses. In many mammals, intrauterine interactions between brothers and sisters 
lead to masculinization of females, which can induce fitness consequences. Many
litter-bearing primates, though, seem to escape androgen-mediated litter effects,
begging why? Here, we investigated how the sex composition (i.e., same- or
mixed-sex) of litters influences perinatal outcomes in the common marmoset monkey
(Callithrix jacchus), using a combination of physiological, morphological, and
behavioural assays. We hypothesized that androgens from male fetuses would
mediate developmental differences across litter types. We found that newborns
(24-36â€‰hours old) from same- and mixed-sex litters were indistinguishable by
urinary androgen profiles, birth weights, morphometrics, and behaviour. However, 
monkeys born into same- and mixed-sex litters exhibited subtle morphological and 
neurobehavioral differences later in the perinatal period, independent of their
androgen profiles. Our findings suggest that while androgens from male fetuses
likely do not organize their siblings' phenotypes, perinatal stimuli may initiate
divergent developmental trajectories among siblings, which, in turn, promotes
inter-individual variability within families.

Neurological compensatory mechanisms help our brain to adjust to
neurodegeneration as in Parkinson's disease. It is suggested that the
compensation of the damaged striato-thalamo-cortical circuit is focused on the
intact thalamo-rubro-cerebellar pathway as seen during presymptomatic Parkinson, 
paradoxical movement and sensorimotor rhythm (SMR). Indeed, the size of the red
nucleus, connecting the cerebellum with the cerebral cortex, is larger in
Parkinson's disease patients suggesting an increased activation of this brain
area. Therefore, the red nucleus was examined in MPTP-induced parkinsonian
marmoset monkeys during the presymptomatic stage and after SMR activation by
neurofeedback training. We found a reverse significant correlation between the
early expression of parkinsonian signs and the size of the parvocellular part of 
the red nucleus, which is predominantly present in human and non-human primates. 
In quadrupedal animals it consists mainly of the magnocellular part. Furthermore,
SMR activation, that mitigated parkinsonian signs, further increased the size of 
the red nucleus in the marmoset monkey. This plasticity of the brain helps to
compensate for dysfunctional movement control and can be a promising target for
compensatory treatment with neurofeedback technology, vibrotactile stimulation or
DBS in order to improve the quality of life for Parkinson's disease patients.

In vitro transformation of Callithrix jacchus marmoset lymphocytes was achieved
with a nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) derived Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) strain,
HKLY-28. Two permanent and virus producing lymphoblastoid cell lines, M81 and
M72, were obtained. Comparison between the original HKLY-28 line and both M81 and
M72 lines showed that passage in the marmosets lymphocytes greatly enhanced viral
production and transforming activity of the virus as observed in cottontop
derived B95.8 lymphoblastoid line.

Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are useful for the study of embryonic development.
However, since research on naturally conceived human embryos is limited,
non-human primate (NHP) embryos and NHP ESCs represent an excellent alternative
to the corresponding human entities. Though, ESC lines derived from naturally
conceived NHP embryos are still very rare. Here, we report the generation and
characterization of four novel ESC lines derived from natural preimplantation
embryos of the common marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus). For the first time we
document derivation of NHP ESCs derived from morula stages. We show that
quantitative chromosome-wise transcriptome analyses precisely reflect trisomies
present in both morula-derived ESC lines. We also demonstrate that the female ESC
lines exhibit different states of X-inactivation which is impressively reflected 
by the abundance of the lncRNA X inactive-specific transcript (XIST). The novel
marmoset ESC lines will promote basic primate embryo and ESC studies as well as
preclinical testing of ESC-based regenerative approaches in NHP.

INTRODUCTION: Arboviruses are associated with human disease, and non-human
primates (NHPs) are important primary hosts. This study shows the detection of
antibodies to Oropouche virus (OROV) in NHPs either living in urban parks or
acclimatized at the Wild Animal Screening Center, Goiânia city.
METHODS: Fifty blood samples were analyzed by hemagglutination-inhibition and
neutralization assays.
RESULTS: Two monkeys (Alouatta caraya) had antibodies to OROV by both techniques.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report demonstrating the detection of OROV
antibodies in Goiás State and may represent the introduction/circulation of OROV 
in the region and a potential risk to the human population.

Effects of Monocular Atropinization on Refractive Error and Eye Growth in Infant 
New World Monkeys.

Whatham AR, Lunn D, Judge SJ.

Purpose: To explore the effect of topical atropine on axial eye growth and
emmetropization in infant marmosets.
Methods: Atropine was applied to one eye from the age of 7 to 56 days in two dose
regimens, High (0.1-1% twice daily, increasing with age) or moderate (Mod) (0.1% 
once daily). Both eyes of the marmosets were refracted, and axial dimensions were
measured ultrasonically, at 14, 28, 42, 49, 56, 70, 105, 168, and 279 days of
age. The time course of each measured variable was analyzed using multilevel
mixed-effects modeling realized in R.
Results: The logistic growth curves fitted to anterior segment depth (ASD) did
not differ significantly between the dose regimens, but xmid, the age at which
growth was half-maximal, and scal, the time constant of the exponential term in
the logistic growth curve equation, differed significantly between the ASD of
atropinized and untreated eyes (P = 0.03 and P < 0.0001, respectively), with the 
ASD of atropinized eyes shorter than that of untreated eyes. The splines fitted
to lens thickness did not vary significantly with dose, but differed
significantly (P < 0.0001) between the atropinized and untreated eyes, with the
atropinized lenses thicker. Vitreous chamber depth (VCD) was not significantly
different, but the variance of VCD was significantly greater (P < 0.001) in the
atropinized compared with the untreated eyes. Refractive error (RE) became
relatively myopic in atropinized eyes. The variance of RE in atropinized eyes was
significantly greater (P < 0.0001) than in untreated eyes.
Conclusions: Atropine caused the infant marmoset lens to move forward and
thicken, a relative myopia, and increases in the between-animals variance in VCD,
which could be considered a failure of emmetropization.

Human chromosome 7 has been the focus of many behavioral, genetic, and medical
studies because it carries genes related to cancer and neurodevelopment. We
examined the evolution of the chromosome 7 homologs, and the 7q31 region in
particular, using chromosome painting analyses and 3 paint probes derived from
(i) the whole of chimpanzee chromosome VII (wcVII), (ii) human 7q31 (h7q31), and 
(iii) the chimpanzee homolog VIIq31 (cVIIq31). The wcVII probe was used instead
of the whole human chromosome 7 because the chimpanzee contains additional
C-bands and revealed large areas of synteny conservation as well as fragmentation
across 20 primate species. Analyses focusing specifically on the 7q31 homolog and
vicinity revealed considerable conservation across lineages with 2 exceptions.
First, the probes verified an insertion of repetitive sequence at VIIq22 in
chimpanzees and bonobos and also detected the sequence in most subtelomeres of
the African apes. Second, a paracentric inversion with a breakpoint in the
cVIIq31 block was found in the common marmoset, confirming earlier studies.
Subsequent in silico comparative genome analysis of 17 primate species revealed
that VIIq31.1 is more significantly conserved at the sequence level than other
regions of chromosome VII, which indicates that its components are likely
responsible for critical shared traits across the order, including conditions
necessary for proper human development and wellbeing.

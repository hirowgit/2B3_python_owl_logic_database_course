Evaluation of the amount of overall animal movement is important for
investigations of motor control mechanisms in the central nervous system. We
describe a new method to quantify overall free movements of an animal without any
markers using a video camera and a personal computer equipped with a
video-capture board. The operating principle is that the amount of overall
movement of an object can be expressed by the difference in total area occupied
by the object in two consecutive picture frames. The software for this
application operates in real-time. Using this method and with proper setting for 
the cage and recording view, we can estimate three-dimensional movements of
animals. The major advantages are low cost, easy operation and high sensitivity. 
The experimental results indicate that this method can be applied to various
fields of motion analysis.

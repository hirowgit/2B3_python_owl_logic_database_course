The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a New World monkey that is
increasingly used in pharmacological and toxicological studies. Thiopurine
S-methyltransferase (TPMT) plays roles in the metabolism of widely used
anticancer and anti-inflammatory drugs. Here, we report the isolation and
molecular characterization of marmoset TPMT cDNA, which was found to contain an
open-reading frame of 245 amino acids that was approximately 92% identical to its
human ortholog. Marmoset TPMT was phylogenetically closer to other primate
orthologs than to its pig, dog, rabbit, or rodent orthologs. Among the five
marmoset tissue types analyzed, marmoset TPMT mRNA was most abundant in kidney
and liver, just as human TPMT is. These results suggest that marmoset and human
TPMT are similar at the molecular level.

Analysis of DR-like molecules on a marmoset Epstein-Barr virus-induced cell line 
using a monomorphic anti-human HLA-DR monoclonal antibody.

Mouse anti-HLA D region-related (DR) monoclonal antibodies have been found to
cross-react with peripheral blood leukocytes from one primate species, the common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). Immunoprecipitates of radioactively labeled cells 
extracted from a marmoset Epstein-Barr virus-induced cell line were analyzed by
one- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and compared with the DR antigens of
a human lymphoblastoid B cell line. Two chains of estimated molecular weights of 
34 000 (alpha) and 28 000 (beta), similar to the human alpha and beta chains,
have been observed in marmoset immunoprecipitates. Additionally, a set of spots
located in the same area as the set of invariant spots found in human HLA-DR
antigens is shown by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Thus, cross-reacting
anti-human HLA-DR monoclonal antibodies could be used to analyze the expression
and the structure of marmoset DR-like antigens.

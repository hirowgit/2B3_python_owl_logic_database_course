Hepatic steatosis, also known as fatty liver, is a spontaneous lesion caused by
the abnormal accumulation of triglycerides within hepatocytes that has been
described in different laboratory-housed nonhuman primate species. Aging is
considered a risk factor in the progression of this lesion in humans and captive 
rhesus macaques. Hepatic steatosis has been reported in sexually mature adult and
aged-adult captive common marmosets. Macroscopic changes in the liver may be
evident in advanced stages of this condition and are characterized by
hepatomegaly with multifocal to coalescing to regionally extensive pale-tan to
yellow, soft foci throughout the hepatic lobes. Biochemical abnormalities in
these cases include significantly increased levels in triglycerides, insulin, and
γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT). Definitive diagnosis is by histopathology and
demonstration of lipid accumulation within hepatocytes. Histopathology is
characterized by large coalescing areas of periacinar to periportal
microvesicular steatosis mixed with clusters of macrovesicular steatosis, and
variable degrees of lobular inflammation. Vacuolated hepatocytes containing
intracytoplasmic lipid material is demonstrated by positive staining to Sudan IV 
and/or Oil red-O.

Genetic intervention is increasingly being explored as a therapeutic option for
debilitating disorders of the central nervous system. The safety and efficacy of 
gene therapies rely upon expressing a transgene in affected cells while
minimizing off-target expression. Here we show organ-specific targeting of
adeno-associated virus (AAV) capsids after intravenous delivery, which we
achieved by employing a Cre-transgenic-based screening platform and sequential
engineering of AAV-PHP.eB between the surface-exposed AA452 and AA460 of VP3.
From this selection, we identified capsid variants that were enriched in the
brain and targeted away from the liver in C57BL/6J mice. This tropism extends to 
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), enabling robust, non-invasive gene delivery to the
marmoset brain after intravenous administration. Notably, the capsids identified 
result in distinct transgene expression profiles within the brain, with one
exhibiting high specificity to neurons. The ability to cross the blood-brain
barrier with neuronal specificity in rodents and non-human primates enables new
avenues for basic research and therapeutic possibilities unattainable with
naturally occurring serotypes.

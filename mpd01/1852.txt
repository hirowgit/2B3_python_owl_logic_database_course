A juvenile common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) was attacked by a whitetail
lancehead viper (Bothrops leucurus) while playing with other group members close 
to the ground at a site in northeastern Brazil. The attack was almost immediately
fatal, but the viper was unable to ingest the body of the marmoset. After
approximately 10 min, during which it attempted to swallow the marmoset a number 
of times, the viper moved away, abandoning the body. While raptors are the
principal predators of callitrichids, this record reinforces the relative
vulnerability of these primates to snakes in comparison with other platyrrhines, 
although the small number of recorded events precludes a more definitive analysis
of the phenomenon.

Cochlear development is a complex process with precise spatiotemporal patterns. A
detailed understanding of this process is important for studies of congenital
hearing loss and regenerative medicine. However, much of our understanding of
cochlear development is based on rodent models. Animal models that bridge the gap
between humans and rodents are needed. In this study, we investigated the
development of hearing organs in a small New World monkey species, the common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). We describe the general stages of cochlear
development in comparison with those of humans and mice. Moreover, we examined
more than 25 proteins involved in cochlear development and found that expression 
patterns were generally conserved between rodents and primates. However, several 
proteins involved in supporting cell processes and neuronal development exhibited
interspecific expression differences. Human fetal samples for studies of
primate-specific cochlear development are extremely rare, especially for late
developmental stages. Our results support the use of the common marmoset as an
effective alternative for analyses of primate cochlear development.

Vocal communication in animals often involves taking turns vocalizing. In humans,
turn-taking is a fundamental rule in conversation. Among non-human primates, the 
common marmoset is known to engage in antiphonal calling using phee calls and
trill calls. Calls of the trill type are the most common, yet difficult to study,
because they are not very loud and uttered in conditions when animals are in
close proximity to one another. Here we recorded trill calls in captive
pair-housed marmosets using wearable microphones, while the animals were together
with their partner or separated, but within trill call range. Trills were
exchanged mainly with the partner and not with other animals in the room. Animals
placed outside the home cage increased their trill call rate and uttered more
trills in response to their partner compared to strangers. The fundamental
frequency, F0, of trills increased when animals were placed outside the cage. Our
results indicate that trill calls can be monitored using wearable audio equipment
and that minor changes in social context affect trill call interactions and
spectral properties of trill calls.

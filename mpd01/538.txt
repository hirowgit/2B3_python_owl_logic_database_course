Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) was first identified as a potent mitogen for
mature hepatocytes, and has also gained attention as a strong neurotrophic factor
in the central nervous system. We found that during the acute phase of spinal
cord injury (SCI) in rats, c-Met, the specific receptor for HGF, increases
sharply, while the endogenous HGF up-regulation is relatively weak. Introducing
exogenous HGF into the spinal cord by injecting an HGF-expressing viral vector
significantly increased the neuron and oligodendrocyte survival, angiogenesis,
and axonal regeneration, to reduce the area of damage and to promote functional
recovery in rats after SCI. Other recent studies in rodents have shown that
exogenously administered HGF during the acute phase of SCI reduces astrocyte
activation to decrease glial scar formation, and exerts anti-inflammatory effects
to reduce leukocyte infiltration. We also reported that the intrathecal infusion 
of recombinant human HGF (intrathecal rhHGF) improves neurological hand function 
after cervical contusive SCI in the common marmoset, a non-human primate. Based
on these collective results, we conducted a phase I/II clinical trial of
intrathecal rhHGF for patients with acute cervical SCI who showed a modified
Frankel grade of A/B1/B2 72 h after injury onset, from June 2014 to May 2018.

Models of primate sociality focus on the costs and benefits of group living and
how factors such as rank, feeding competition, alliance formation, and
cooperative behavior shape within-group social relationships. We conducted a
series of controlled field experiments designed to investigate how resource
distribution (one or three of four reward platforms) and amount of food on a
reward platform affected foraging strategies and individual feeding success in
four groups of wild common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) living in the Caatinga 
of northeastern Brazil. At our field site, common marmoset groups are
characterized by a single breeding female who can produce twin litters twice per 
year, strong social cohesion, and cooperative infant care provided principally by
several adult male helpers. We found that except for the dominant breeding
female, rank (based on aggression) was not a strong predictor of feeding success.
Although the breeding female in each group occupied the highest rank position and
obtained the greatest daily feeding success, all other group members, including
adults and juveniles experienced relatively equal feeding success across most
experimental conditions. This was accomplished using a balance of behavioral
strategies related to contest competition, scramble competition (associated with 
a finder's advantage), and social tolerance (sharing the same feeding platform). 
Based on these results, the social structure of common marmosets is best
described as "single female dominance," with the breeding female maximizing food 
intake needed to offset the energetic costs associated with reproductive twinning
and the ability to produce two litters per year. Cooperative infant caregiving,
in which the number of helpers is positively correlated with offspring
survivorship, requires a set of behavioral strategies that serve to reduce
contest competition and promote prosocial behaviors at feeding sites.

We tested current hypotheses on the functional organization of the third visual
complex, a particularly controversial region of the primate extrastriate cortex. 
In anatomical experiments, injections of retrograde tracers were placed in the
dorsal cortex immediately rostral to the second visual area (V2) of New World
monkeys (Callithrix jacchus), revealing the topography of interconnections
between the "third tier" cortex and the primary visual area (V1). The data
indicate the presence of a dorsomedial area (DM), which represents the entire
upper and lower quadrants of the visual field, and which receives strong,
topographically organized projections from the superficial layers of V1. The
visuotopic organization and boundaries of DM were confirmed by
electrophysiological recordings in the same animals and by architectural
characteristics which were distinct from those found in ventral extrastriate
cortex rostral to V2. There was no electrophysiological or histological evidence 
for a transitional area between V2 and DM. In particular, the central
representation of the upper quadrant in DM was directly adjacent to the
representation of the horizontal meridian that marks the rostral border of V2.
The present results argue in favor of the hypothesis that the third visual
complex in New World monkeys contains different areas in its dorsal and ventral
components: area DM, near the dorsal midline, and a homolog of area 19 of other
mammals, located more lateral and ventrally. The characteristics of DM suggest
that it may correspond to visual area 6 (V6) of Old World monkeys.

RATIONALE: LY354740 is a recently developed metabotropic glutamatergic receptor 2
and 3 (mGluR2/3) agonist. A high density of mGluR2 has been reported in terminal 
fields of the perforant path in rodents and humans, suggesting its involvement in
cognitive functions mediated by the temporal lobe, including memory. A small
number of in vivo studies in rodents have assessed the effects of LY354740 on
memory tasks, reporting the induction of impaired memory for spatial orientation 
in a water maze task and for delayed match and non-match to position in an
operant version of these tasks.
OBJECTIVE: In the present primate study, we used radioautography to describe the 
distribution and intensity of (3)H-LY354740 binding in the hippocampal formation 
of the common marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus) relative to the rat. In the
major, in vivo part of the study, the effects of systemic LY354740 on
computerized tasks of attention and memory were investigated.
METHODS: Adult common marmosets were trained to perform a five-choice serial
reaction time (5-CSRT) task and a concurrent delayed match-to-position (CDMP)
task from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Automated test Battery (CANTAB).
Filter tests of LY354740 effects on motor dexterity and motivation for reward
revealed high inter-individual variation in sensitivity; therefore, on the
5-CSRT, subjects were tested at a dose range of 3--10 mg/kg, and on the CDMP,
subjects were tested at 1--3 or 3--10 mg/kg.
RESULTS: Radioautography revealed a relatively low level of (3)H-LY354740 binding
in the marmoset hippocampal formation compared to the rat. Despite low binding,
LY354740 reduced sustained-attention accuracy in the 5-CSRT, and reduced accuracy
in two stages of the CDMP.
CONCLUSIONS: The current study provides novel evidence for the importance of
mGluR2/3 in the regulation of primate cognitive functioning.

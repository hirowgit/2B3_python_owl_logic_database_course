Before autoimmune diseases in humans can be treated with gene therapy, the safety
and efficacy of the used vectors must be tested in valid experimental models.
Monkeys, such as the rhesus macaque or the common marmoset, provide such models. 
This publication reviews the state of the art in monkey models for rheumatoid
arthritis and multiple sclerosis and the (few) gene therapy experiments that have
been performed in these models.

The expression profile of the monoclonal antibody SMI-32 was examined in the
superior colliculus of adult marmosets. This antibody recognises subunits of the 
non- and dephosphorylated neurofilament protein, labelling predominantly neuronal
perikarya and dendrites. The densest cellular label was observed in the
intermediate layers (primarily, the stratum griseum intermediale), consisting of 
large multi- or bipolar neurones which were preferentially located within
cytochrome oxidase-rich regions. The morphological characteristics of neurones
showing heavy staining resemble those of extrinsic projection cells, suggesting a
correlation between neurofilament content and axonal length.

The life span and survival parameters of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus)
in a breeding colony at CLEA Japan, Inc. were investigated. The average life span
of male marmosets was 148.5 ± 6.1 (mean ± SE) months of age (M), which was
significantly longer (P < 0.01) than that of females (111.7 ± 6.0 M).
Additionally, the male population reached 25-, 50-, 75- and 90 %-mortality at an 
older age than the female population. However, the maximum life span in males
(259.9 M) was shorter than in females (262.5 M). The survival of females shows a 
relatively continuous decline; however, the male marmosets show a slight decline 
in survival during the first 7-9 years and then a dramatic decrease and another
slight decline after 14-16 year of age in survival, i.e., a lifespan curve
similar to what is observed in colonies of aging rodents and humans. The
sex-associated difference in life span was caused by reproductive burden on the
females. The present study reported a longer than expected life span of the
marmoset, and a long-lived animal can be a powerful model for senescence and
longevity sciences.

BACKGROUND: Many human diseases are modulated by intrauterine environment, which 
is called prenatal programming. This study investigated effects of prenatal
glucocorticoids on the lipid metabolism of three filial generations of common
marmosets.
METHODS: Pregnant primates were treated with dexamethasone during pregnancy. Body
weight and blood lipid parameters of adult female offspring (F1: n = 5, F2: n =
6, F3: n = 3) were compared with age-related female controls (n = 12).
RESULTS: F1, F2, and F3 offspring showed significantly lower percentage of plasma
n3 fatty acids than controls. F2 and F3 presented higher cholesterol levels, with
significantly more LDL cholesterol, significantly less HDL triglycerides and an
enhanced cholesterol/HDL cholesterol ratio. Body weight was not significantly
affected.
CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal dexamethasone led to higher amounts of cardiovascular risk 
factors and less protective parameters in female F1-F3 offspring. The
intergenerational consequences suggest prenatal programming through epigenetic
effects.

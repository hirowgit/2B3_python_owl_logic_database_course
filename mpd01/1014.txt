Currently, the amount of sequenced and classified MHC class I genes of the common
marmoset is limited, in spite of the wide use of this species as an animal model 
for biomedical research. In this study, 480 clones of MHC class I G locus
(Caja-G) cDNA sequences were obtained from 21 common marmosets. Up to 10
different alleles were detected in each common marmoset, leading to the
assumption that the Caja-G loci duplicated in the marmoset genome. In the
investigated population, four alleles occurred more often, giving evidence for
higher immunological advantage of these alleles. In contrast to the human
non-classical MHC class I genes, Caja-G shows high rates of polymorphism at the
relevant peptide-binding sites, despite its phylogenetic relationship to the
non-classical HLA-G. Our results provide information for better understanding of 
the immunological properties of the common marmoset and confirm the theory of a
gene conversion of the Caja-G due to its detected plasticity and the absence of
any known HLA-A equivalent.

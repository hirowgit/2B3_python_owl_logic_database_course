The ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) is a key brain structure implicated in
mood and anxiety disorders, based primarily on evidence from correlational
neuroimaging studies. Composed of a number of brain regions with distinct
architecture and connectivity, dissecting its functional heterogeneity will
provide key insights into the symptomatology of these disorders. Focusing on area
14, lying on the medial and orbital surfaces of the gyrus rectus, this study
addresses a key question of causality. Do changes in area 14 activity induce
changes in threat- and reward-elicited responses within the nonhuman primate, the
common marmoset, similar to that seen in mood and anxiety disorders? Area 14
overactivation was found to induce heightened responsivity to uncertain,
low-imminence threat while blunting cardiovascular and behavioral anticipatory
arousal to high-value food reward. Conversely, inactivation enhanced the arousal 
to high-value reward cues while dampening the acquisition of cardiovascular and
behavioral responses to a Pavlovian threat cue. Basal cardiovascular activity,
including heart rate variability and sympathovagal balance, which are
dysfunctional in mood and anxiety disorders, are insensitive to alterations in
area 14 activity as is the extinction of conditioned threat responses. The
distinct pattern of dysregulation compared to neighboring region area 25
highlights the heterogeneity of function within vmPFC and reveals how the effects
of area 14 overactivation on positive and negative reactivity mirror symptoms of 
anhedonia and anxiety that are so often comorbid in mood disorders.

Staphylococcal enterotoxins (SEs) are extracellular proteins, produced mainly by 
Staphylococcus aureus, which cause staphylococcal food poisoning (SFP) when
ingested. Here, a novel SE was identified from two strains, which were identified
as the causative microbes of the SFP outbreak that occurred in Tokyo in 2004.
Both strains harbored the SEA gene, but its production was lower than that of
other SEA-producing SFP isolates. Whole-genome sequencing analysis demonstrated
that both strains harbored a SE-like gene besides sea. Phylogenetic analysis
revealed that the amino acid sequence deduced from the SE-like gene belonged to
the SEB group. Therefore, this gene was presumed to be a novel SE gene and termed
"SE02." The stability of SE02 against heating and proteolytic digestions was a
little different from that of SEA. SE02 has both superantigenic and emetic
bioactivities. Namely, SE02 activated mouse splenocytes and exhibited emetic
activity in the common marmoset. SE02 mRNA was highly expressed in both isolates 
during the exponential phase of cultivation. In addition, SE02 protein was
produced at 20 °C and 25 °C, which reflects the actual situation of SFP. SE02
appears to be a novel emetic toxin that was likely the causative toxin in
combination with SEA in the SFP outbreak.

Genetic polymorphism in the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of the dopamine
transporter (DAT) gene has been reported in both human and nonhuman primates, and
the variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) polymorphism has been related to
several neurological and psychiatric disorders. As New World primates have been
employed as models in biomedical research in these fields, in the present study
we assessed genetic variation in the DAT gene in 25 robust capuchin monkeys
(Sapajus spp.) and 39 common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus). Using enzymatic
amplification followed by sequencing of amplified fragments, a VNTR polymorphism 
in the 3'-UTR region of the DAT gene was identified in both robust capuchins and 
common marmosets. The polymorphic tandem repeat of 40-bp basic units is similar
to the human VNTR consensus sequence, with size variants composed of 9, 10, and
11 units in marmosets and 8, 9, 13, and 17 basic units in capuchins. We found
behavioral evidence that carrying the 10-repeat DAT allele promotes flexible
choice and maximization of foraging in marmosets tested in an operant choice
paradigm. Moreover, in an intertemporal choice task, capuchins with longer repeat
variants show less self-controlled choices than capuchins with at least one short
repeat variant. Future research should focus on the relationship between these
DAT polymorphisms, dopamine reuptake via the dopamine transporter, and behavioral
and cognitive variation across New World monkey individuals.

PURPOSE: The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a New World primate of
increasing interest to neuroscience and in translational brain research. The
present work describes the design and implementation of individualized 8-channel 
receive-only radiofrequency (RF) coil arrays that provide whole-brain coverage
and allow anatomical and functional MRI experiments in conscious, awake
marmosets.
METHODS: The coil arrays were designed with their elements embedded inside
individualized restraint helmets. The size, geometry, and arrangement of the coil
elements were optimized to allow whole-brain coverage. Coil-to-coil decoupling
was achieved by a combination of geometric decoupling and low input impedance
preamplifiers. The performance of the embedded arrays was compared against that
of one 8-channel receive-only array built to fit the external surface of the
helmets.
RESULTS: Three individualized helmets with embedded coil arrays were built for
three marmosets. Whole-brain coverage was achieved with high sensitivity
extending over the entire cortex. Visual stimulation of conscious awake marmosets
elicited robust BOLD fMRI responses in both primary and higher order visual areas
of the occipitotemporal cortex.
CONCLUSION: The high sensitivity provided by embedded receive-only coil arrays
allows both anatomical and functional MRI data to be obtained with high spatial
resolution in conscious, awake marmosets. Magn Reson Med 78:387-398, 2017. © 2016

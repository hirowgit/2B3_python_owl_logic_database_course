The reproductive potential of the common cotton-eared marmoset (Callithrix
jacchus) in captivity.

Phillips IR.

The breeding records of a closed colony of marmosets maintained for five years
are described. Three generations have been born and a high incidence of
multiparity has been achieved. The reproductive potential of C. jacchus is higher
than that of virtually any other primate maintained in captivity.

Autoradiographic studies on the distribution of 3H-mescaline in the brain of the 
marmoset, Callithrix jacchus.

Korr H.

Autoradiographs of the brain of the marmoset, Callithrix jacchus, show a strong
labeling of the hippocampus and the N. amygdalae 18 h after injection of
3H-mescaline. A similar characteristic autoradiographic pattern was previously
found in the mouse brain, too.

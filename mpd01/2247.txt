Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of
migraine. Early chemistry leads suffered from modest potency, significant CYP3A4 
inhibition, and poor aqueous solubility. Herein, we describe the optimization of 
these leads to give 4 (BMS-694153), a molecule with outstanding potency, a
favorable predictive toxicology profile, and remarkable aqueous solubility.
Compound 4 has good intranasal bioavailability in rabbits and shows
dose-dependent activity in validated in vivo and ex vivo migraine models.

The search for experimental (animal) models is essential to the development of
clinical studies.AIM: To demonstrate, by means of micro dissection techniques,
the anatomical structures of temporal bones from the primate Callithrix sp.
STUDY DESIGN: Experimental.
METHODS: Dissection of temporal bone structures of Callithrix sp and photographic
documentation.
RESULTS: We identified the main constituents of the temporal bone (external,
medium and inner ear and facial nerve).
CONCLUSION: The non-human primate Callithrix sp. is an adequate experimental
model for the studies of temporal bone structures given its close anatomical
similarities to that found in humans.

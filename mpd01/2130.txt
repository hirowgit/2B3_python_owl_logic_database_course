Much of what is known about how the cochlear nuclei participate in mammalian
hearing comes from studies of non-primate mammalian species. To determine to what
extent the cochlear nuclei of primates resemble those of other mammalian orders, 
we have recorded responses to sound in three primate species: marmosets,
cynomolgus macaques, and squirrel monkeys. These recordings show that the same
types of temporal firing patterns are found in primates that have been described 
in other mammals. Responses to tones of neurons in the ventral cochlear nucleus
have similar tuning, latencies, post-stimulus time and interspike interval
histograms as those recorded in non-primate cochlear nucleus neurons. In the
dorsal cochlear nucleus, too, responses were similar. From these results it is
evident that insights gained from non-primate studies can be applied to the
peripheral auditory system of primates.

BACKGROUND: Marmosets and tamarins are increasingly used in research, but their
pathology remains poorly defined compared with Old World primates.
METHODS: Necropsy records of 129 marmosets and 52 tamarins were reviewed; none
was used experimentally.
RESULTS: The most common marmoset lesions were dehydration, emaciation,
nephritis, colitis, and inanition. The most common tamarin lesions were
dehydration, ascites, emaciation, and congestive heart failure. Colitis and heart
disease were the most common cause of death in marmosets and tamarins,
respectively. Immature marmoset and tamarin deaths often occurred within the
first month of life. Immature marmosets usually died from inanition, stillbirth, 
and colitis; immature tamarins from atelectasis, stillbirth, heart failure, and
colitis. Lymphoma was the most common neoplasm for both marmosets and tamarins.
CONCLUSION: The findings were similar to prior reports with differences in
frequency and severity. We report the first case of endometriosis in a marmoset.

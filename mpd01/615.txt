BACKGROUND: Congenital fused labia (CFL) is defined as a failure or significant
delay in the opening of the juvenile sealed labia majora. This phenotype is known
to be variably common in adult captive female marmosets but has never been
investigated in detail before.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Here, we define, describe and quantify the variations in
the degree of closure of the vulva in 122 captive marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) 
from 1.2 to 42 months old and include colony analysis.
RESULTS: There was a negative correlation between the degree of labial fusion and
animal age after prepubertal period (P < 0.05). CFL females had higher number CFL
relatives (4.3 ± 0.6 vs 2.4 ± 0.5 for non-CFL, P < 0.05) and more external
ancestors compared to non-CFL (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results therefore suggest that CFL phenotype is most likely
associated with epigenetic effects induced by the captive environment and colony 
management strategy of extensive crossing of family lines to promote
heterozygosity.

Chronic diarrhea in laboratory-bred marmosets poses a serious health problem
during experiments. Despite a growing demand for laboratory-bred experimental
marmosets, the mechanisms underlying the development of diarrhea and measures for
its treatment and prevention remain unclear. To explore the factors affecting
development of chronic diarrhea in laboratory-bred marmosets, the gut microbiota 
composition (GMC) of 58 laboratory-bred marmosets, including 19 animals with
chronic diarrhea, was analyzed using terminal restriction fragment length
polymorphism. We found that the GMCs in these animals cluster into two groups
that differ significantly in rate of chronic diarrhea (56.5% in one group,
Cluster 1, and 17.1% in Cluster 2). Additionally, a higher α-diversity and a
lower proportion of Bifidobacterium spp. according to quantitative PCR was found 
the animals in the Cluster 1 than in those in Cluster 2. Taken together, our
findings indicate that there is a relationship between GMC and development of
chronic diarrhea in laboratory-bred marmosets. This is the first study to
highlight the potential of assessing GMC in relation to development of chronic
diarrhea in laboratory-bred marmosets.

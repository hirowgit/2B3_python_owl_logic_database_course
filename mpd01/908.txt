Despite the importance of transition metals for normal brain function, relatively
little is known about the distribution of these elemental species across the
different tissue compartments of the primate brain. In this study, we employed
laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry on PFA-fixed brain
sections obtained from two adult common marmosets. Concurrent cytoarchitectonic, 
myeloarchitectonic, and chemoarchitectonic measurements allowed for
identification of the major neocortical, archaecortical, and subcortical
divisions of the brain, and precise localisation of iron, manganese, and zinc
concentrations within each division. Major findings across tissue compartments
included: (1) differentiation of white matter tracts from grey matter based on
manganese and zinc distribution; (2) high iron concentrations in the basal
ganglia, cortex, and substantia nigra; (3) co-localization of high concentrations
of iron and manganese in the primary sensory areas of the cerebral cortex; and
(4) high manganese in the hippocampus. The marmoset has become a model species of
choice for connectomic, aging, and transgenic studies in primates, and the
application of metallomics to these disciplines has the potential to yield high
translational and basic science value.

Data on spontaneous pathology are substantially scarce for common marmosets,
compared to other laboratory animals, but is essential for the interpretation of 
histological findings in the context of toxicological and experimental studies.
Especially if common marmosets are used as experimental animals in respiratory
research, detailed knowledge on the spectrum, occurrence, and incidence of
spontaneous histopathological pulmonary lesions in this non-human primate species
is required. In this study, lung tissue of 638 common marmosets from the marmoset
colony of the German Primate Center was examined histologically. The analysis
revealed a high incidence of predominantly mild and multifocal interstitial
pneumonia (32.99 %) of unknown etiology in most cases. Only few marmosets
exhibited lobar pneumonia (1.41 %) and bronchopneumonia (0.94), which were mainly
caused by bacterial pathogens such as Bordetella bronchiseptica and Klebsiella
pneumoniae. Lung immaturity and atelectasis were common histological findings in 
newborn marmosets. Typical background lesions included anthracosis (8.15 %),
hemosiderosis (1.72 %), extramedullary hematopoiesis (11.6 %), mineralization
(10.97 %), and inflammatory cell foci (10.34 %). In addition, three cases of
pulmonary arteriopathy (0.47 %) and 1 case of foreign-body granuloma (0.16 %)
were detected in the marmoset study cohort. The high prevalence of circulatory
disturbances (congestion, edema, hemorrhage) and changes in air content
(secondary atelectasis, alveolar emphysema) could partly be explained by
euthanasia-related artifacts or agonal changes. The present study provides a
comprehensive overview of the range and incidence of spontaneous pulmonary
histopathology in common marmosets, serving as valuable reference data for the
interpretation of lung lesions in toxicological and experimental marmoset
studies.

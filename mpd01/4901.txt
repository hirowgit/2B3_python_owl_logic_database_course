Anti-brucella agglutinins in bats and "Callithrix" monkeys.

Ricciardi ID, Nunes MP, Andrade CM, Da Silva AG.

Anti-Brucella agglutinins were found in 5 of 53 (9.4%) vampire bats Desmodus
rotundus, captured in the State of Bahia, Brasil. Two specimens of Diphylla
ecaudata were negative. Fifty specimens of the small monkey, Callithrix
penicillata, were also negative.

Histochemical studies on the adrenal glands of the marmosets (Callithrix jacchus 
and Callithrix penicillata).

Miraglia T, Sadigursky M, Roters FA, Pinto G.

The histrochemistry of the adrenal glands was studied in four adult male
marmosets (two Callithrix jacchus and two Callithrix penicillata). It was
impossible to demonstrate any reactivity to UDPG-GT, ADH, alanyl aminopeptidase, 
leucine aminopeptidase, xilitol (NAD-dependent) dehydrogenase, beta-glucuronidase
and aryl-sulfatase in these glands. Total phosphorylase was found in scattered
cells of the glomerulosa and adjacent outer fasciculata of one C. penicillata.
The dehydrogenases (LDH, G-6-PDH,6-PGDH, NADPH2-TR,ICDH,SDH,NADH2-TR, alpha-GPDH,
beta-OHBDH) as well as the hydrolases (except alkaline phosphatase, ATPase, and
acetylcholinesterase) showed a stonger reactivity in the cortical part. Some
hydrolases (naphthol acetate esterase, acid phosphatase) and cytochrome oxidase
were less reactive in the zona glomerulosa, where the dehydrogenases were more
abundant. The outer fasciculata and the reticularis also showed a strong
dehydrogenase reactivity.

The apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (apoER2) gene consists of a mosaic of exons,
which may have been assembled by "exon shuffling." Analysis of apoER2 transcripts
in several species reveals a lost repeat in the ligand-binding domain of primate 
apoER2. A pseudo-exon found in the primate apoER2 genes corresponds to the lost
repeat but contains a crucial deletion that leads to a translational frameshift. 
The pseudo-exon sequence in primary transcripts of the human apoER2 gene is shown
to be abolished by exon skipping due to two nucleotide substitutions at the
5'-splice donor adjacent to the pseudo-exon. These data suggest the occurrence of
exon loss in the evolution of the primate apoER2 gene.

Autoradiographic studies on the distribution of 3H-mescaline in the brain of the 
marmoset, Callithrix jacchus.

Korr H.

Autoradiographs of the brain of the marmoset, Callithrix jacchus, show a strong
labeling of the hippocampus and the N. amygdalae 18 h after injection of
3H-mescaline. A similar characteristic autoradiographic pattern was previously
found in the mouse brain, too.

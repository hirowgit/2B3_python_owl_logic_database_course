Aging of human testis and associated cellular changes is difficult to assess.
Therefore, we used a translational, non-human primate model to get insights into 
underlying cellular and biochemical processes. Using proteomics and
immunohistochemistry, we analyzed testicular tissue of young (age 2 to 3) and old
(age 10 to 12) common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus). Using a mass
spectrometry-based proteomics approach, we identified 63,124 peptides, which
could be assigned to 5924 proteins. Among them, we found proteins specific for
germ cells and somatic cells, such as Leydig and Sertoli cells. Quantitative
analysis showed 31 differentially abundant proteins, of which 29 proteins were
more abundant in older animals. An increased abundance of anti-proliferative
proteins, among them CDKN2A, indicate reduced cell proliferation in old testes.
Additionally, an increased abundance of several small leucine rich repeat
proteoglycans and other extracellular matrix proteins was observed, which may be 
related to impaired cell migration and fibrotic events. Furthermore, an increased
abundance of proteins with inhibitory roles in smooth muscle cell contraction
like CNN1 indicates functional alterations in testicular peritubular cells and
may mirror a reduced capacity of these cells to contract in old testes.

Humans have used non-human primates (hereafter referred to as primates) as food
source, medicine, parts of rituals, pets, and models for various studies
worldwide. Here we investigated the extent of the use of primates by humans in
three areas in northeastern Brazil, the country's most impoverished region. We
carried out our study in three biomes (Caatinga, Cerrado, and Atlantic Forest).
The results showed that humans exploited all five primate species occurring in
the study sites: Callithrix jacchus, Sapajus flavius, Sapajus
libidinosus, Alouatta belzebul, and Alouatta ululata. They used the primates as a
food source, as pets and medicines, and for leisure. Despite socioeconomic
differences in the study areas, we found similarities in the use of primates.
Larger primates were targeted for meat, whereas the small common marmosets were
targeted as pets. We found conflicting interactions between humans and bearded
capuchins due to crop raiding, but no such conflict was found between humans and 
blonde capuchins, reflecting the differences in crop type, pattern, and tradition
in the sites. A. ululata was used as medicine. We suggest that environmental
education actions in the study areas should focus on (i) raising awareness among 
local people of the ecological importance of primates, (ii) providing alternative
activities to hunting whenever possible, and (iii) minimising conflicts.

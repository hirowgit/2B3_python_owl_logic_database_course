BACKGROUND: The immune system is increasingly mentioned as a potential target for
Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatment.
OBJECTIVE: In the present pilot study, the effect of (neuro)inflammation on
amyloidopathy was investigated in the marmoset monkey, which has potential as an 
AD animal model due to its natural cerebral amyloidosis similar to humans.
METHODS: Six adult/aged marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) were intracranial injected
with amyloid-beta (Aβ) fibrils at three cortical locations in the right
hemisphere. Additionally, in half of the monkeys, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was
co-injected with the Aβ fibrils and injected in the other hemisphere without Aβ
fibrils. The other three monkeys received phosphate buffered saline instead of
LPS, as a control for the inflammatory state. The effect of inflammation on
amyloidopathy was also investigated in an additional monkey that suffered from
chronic inflammatory wasting syndrome. Mirror histology sections were analyzed to
assess amyloidopathy and immune reaction, and peripheral blood for AD biomarker
expression.
RESULTS: All LPS-injected monkeys showed an early AD immune blood cell expression
profile on CD95 and CD45RA. Two out of three monkeys injected with Aβ and LPS and
the additional monkey, suffering from chronic inflammation, developed plaques.
None of the controls, injected with Aβ only, developed any plaques.
CONCLUSION: This study shows the importance of immune modulation on the
susceptibility for amyloidosis, a hallmark of AD, which offers new perspectives
for disease modifying approaches in AD.

The authors previously investigated progressive glomerulonephropathy in 2- to
11-year-old common marmosets and characterized age-related changes of the renal
glomeruli and development of tubulointerstitial lesions. In this study,
immunoglobulin deposition and ultrastructural changes of the glomeruli were
investigated in 5 young marmosets from 6 months to 3 years of age with pre-onset 
or early glomerulonephropathy. In all animals, the foot processes of podocytes
were effaced, and IgM was deposited into the glomeruli. In glomeruli without
glomerular basement membrane (GBM) alteration, IgM was the only immunoglobulin
type deposited in the glomeruli. In cases with more advanced lesions of
reticulation and thickening of GBM, IgA and IgG deposits were also observed.
Therefore, the authors conclude that IgM may be the primary or earliest
immunoglobulin deposited in this nephropathy, whereas IgA and IgG deposition may 
be connected to the progression of the glomerular lesions. IgM deposition and
foot process effacement of podocytes occur early in the life of affected
marmosets.

Mammalian pluripotent stem cells are thought to exist in two states: naive and
primed. Generally, unlike those in rodents, pluripotent stem cells in primates,
including humans, are regarded as being in the primed pluripotent state.
Recently, several groups reported the existence of naive pluripotent stem cells
in humans. In this study, we report the conversion of primed state embryonic stem
cells from common marmoset, a New World monkey, to the naive state using
transgenes. The cells showed typical naive state features, including dome-like
colony morphology, growth factor requirement, gene expression profile, X
chromosome activation state, and energy metabolic status. Moreover, interspecies 
chimeric embryo formation ability with mouse embryos was increased in the naive
state. This technique can be applied in basic medical research using nonhuman
primates, such as preclinical use of naive pluripotent stem cells and generating 
genetically modified primates.

In Brazil, rabies occurs mainly within an urban cycle, in which dogs and bats are
reservoirs. This paper aims to report the occurrence of rabies in Callithrix sp. 
in Niterói, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. In June 2019 a hybrid specimen was referred
for diagnosis. The Direct Fluorescent Antibody, Mouse Inoculation, and Polymerase
Chain Reaction tests were positive. A phylogenetic analysis was compatible with
antigenic variant 3, characteristic of Desmodus rotundus. New studies should be
undertaken to elucidate the real role of callitrichids in the urban rabies cycle.

Astrocytes, the star-shaped glial cells, are the most abundant non-neuronal cell 
population in the central nervous system. They play a key role in modulating
activities of neural networks, including those involved in complex motor
behaviors. Common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus), the most vocal non-human
primate (NHP), have been used to study the physiology of vocalization and social 
vocal production. However, the neural circuitry involved in vocal production is
not fully understood. In addition, even less is known about the involvement of
astrocytes in this circuit. To understand the role, that astrocytes may play in
the complex behavior of vocalization, the initial step may be to study their
structural properties in the cortical and subcortical regions that are known to
be involved in vocalization. Here, in the common marmoset, we identify all
astrocytic subtypes seen in other primate's brains, including intralaminar
astrocytes. In addition, we reveal detailed structural characteristics of
astrocytes and perform morphometric analysis of astrocytes residing in the cortex
and midbrain regions that are associated with vocal production. We found that
cortical astrocytes in these regions illustrate a higher level of complexity when
compared to those in the midbrain. We hypothesize that this complexity that is
expressed in cortical astrocytes may reflect their functions to meet the
metabolic/structural needs of these regions.

For achieving retrograde gene transfer, we have so far developed two types of
lentiviral vectors pseudotyped with fusion envelope glycoprotein, termed HiRet
vector and NeuRet vector, consisting of distinct combinations of rabies virus and
vesicular stomatitis virus glycoproteins. In the present study, we compared the
patterns of retrograde transgene expression for the HiRet vs. NeuRet vectors by
testing the cortical input system. These vectors were injected into the motor
cortex in rats, marmosets, and macaques, and the distributions of retrograde
labels were investigated in the cortex and thalamus. Our histological analysis
revealed that the NeuRet vector generally exhibits a higher efficiency of
retrograde gene transfer than the HiRet vector, though its capacity of retrograde
transgene expression in the macaque brain is unexpectedly low, especially in
terms of the intracortical connections, as compared to the rat and marmoset
brains. It was also demonstrated that the NeuRet but not the HiRet vector
displays sufficiently high neuron specificity and causes no marked
inflammatory/immune responses at the vector injection sites in the primate
(marmoset and macaque) brains. The present results indicate that the retrograde
transgene efficiency of the NeuRet vector varies depending not only on the
species but also on the input projections.

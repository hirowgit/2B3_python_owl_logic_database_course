Staphylococcal enterotoxins (SEs) are extracellular proteins, produced mainly by 
Staphylococcus aureus, which cause staphylococcal food poisoning (SFP) when
ingested. Here, a novel SE was identified from two strains, which were identified
as the causative microbes of the SFP outbreak that occurred in Tokyo in 2004.
Both strains harbored the SEA gene, but its production was lower than that of
other SEA-producing SFP isolates. Whole-genome sequencing analysis demonstrated
that both strains harbored a SE-like gene besides sea. Phylogenetic analysis
revealed that the amino acid sequence deduced from the SE-like gene belonged to
the SEB group. Therefore, this gene was presumed to be a novel SE gene and termed
"SE02." The stability of SE02 against heating and proteolytic digestions was a
little different from that of SEA. SE02 has both superantigenic and emetic
bioactivities. Namely, SE02 activated mouse splenocytes and exhibited emetic
activity in the common marmoset. SE02 mRNA was highly expressed in both isolates 
during the exponential phase of cultivation. In addition, SE02 protein was
produced at 20 °C and 25 °C, which reflects the actual situation of SFP. SE02
appears to be a novel emetic toxin that was likely the causative toxin in
combination with SEA in the SFP outbreak.

The role by which the gut microbiome influences host health (e.g., energy
equilibrium and immune system) may be partly mediated by short-chain fatty acids,
which are bacterial fermentation products from the dietary fibers. However,
little is known about longitudinal changes in gut microbiome metabolites during
cohabitation alongside social contact. In common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus), 
the gut microbiome community is influenced by social contact, as newly paired
males and females develop convergent microbial profiles. Here, we monitored the
dynamics of short-chain fatty acid concentrations in common marmoset feces from
the prepairing (PRE) to postpairing (POST) stages. In males, we observed that the
concentrations of acetate, propionate, isobutyrate, and isovalerate significantly
increased in the POST stage compared to the PRE stage. However, no significant
changes were found in females. We further found that the propionate concentration
was significantly positively correlated with the abundance of
Phascolarctobacterium in the male feces. Thus, the sex difference in the changes 
in the concentrations of short-chain fatty acids might be related to sex-biased
gut microbiome transmission after pairing. We suggest that the significant
changes in the gut microbiomes and some short-chain fatty acids of the common
marmoset during cohabitation may contribute to physiological homeostasis during
pairing.IMPORTANCE This study addressed a knowledge gap about longitudinal
changes in the gut microbiome metabolites during animal pairing. This research in
the laboratory common marmoset can control for the confounding factors such as
diet and other environmental conditions. Phascolarctobacterium showed the highest
contribution to the sex-biased transmission of the female to the male after
pairing. Here, we observed the sex difference in the increase in short-chain
fatty acid concentration in the feces of newly paired marmosets, which may be
caused by the sex-biased gut microbiome transmission after pairing.

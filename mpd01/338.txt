Due to the global burden of dengue disease, a vaccine is urgently needed. One of 
the key points in vaccine development is the development of a robust and reliable
animal model of dengue virus infection. Characteristics including the ability to 
sustain viral replication, demonstration of clinical signs, and immune response
that resemble those of human dengue virus infection are vital in animal models.
Preclinical studies in vaccine development usually include parameters such as
safety evaluation, induction of viremia and antigenemia, immunogenicity, and
vaccine effectiveness. Although mice have been used as a model, non-human
primates have an advantage over mice because of their relative similarity to
humans in their genetic composition and immune responses. This review compares
the viremia kinetics and antibody responses of cynomolgus macaques (Macaca
fasicularis), common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus), and tamarins (Saguinus midas
and Saguinus labitus) and summarize the perspectives and the usefulness along
with challenges in dengue vaccine development.

Human studies with self-reported measures have suggested a link between an
avoidant coping style and high anxiety. Here, using the common marmoset as a
model, we characterize the latent factors underlying behavioral responses of
these monkeys towards low and high imminence threat and investigate if a
predominantly avoidant behavioral response to high imminence threat is associated
with greater anxiety-like behavior in a context of low imminence threat.
Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) of the human intruder test of low imminence
threat revealed a single factor in which a combination of active vigilance and
avoidance responses underpinned anxiety-like behavior. In contrast, two
negatively-associated factors were revealed in the model snake test reflecting
active and avoidant coping to high imminence threat. Subsequent analysis showed
that animals with a predominantly avoidant coping style on the model snake test
displayed higher anxiety-like behavior on the human intruder test, findings
consistent with those described in humans. Together they illustrate the richness 
of the behavioral repertoire displayed by marmosets in low and high imminence
threatening contexts and the additional insight that factor analysis can provide 
by identifying the latent factors underlying these complex behavioral datasets.
They also highlight the translational value of this approach when studying the
neural circuits underlying complex anxiety-like states in this primate model.

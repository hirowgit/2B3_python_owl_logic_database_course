Immunocytochemical localization of neuropeptides (beta-endorphin, substance P,
arginine vasopressin, oxytocin), pituitary hormones (adrenocorticotropin,
prolactin, growth hormone, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), gonadal inhibin,
gastrin, and human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG)) was carried out in marmoset
testis during development. Both intensity of immunostaining and distribution of
these peptides in testicular compartments viz. seminiferous tubules and Leydig
cells changed dramatically during development. In vitro biosynthesis of inhibin
and FSH was increased by hCG, whereas prolactin (5 micrograms) and prostatic
inhibin peptide suppressed the synthesis of these hormones.

Experiments in MPTP-treated non-human primates testing potential antiparkinsonian
action have shown both, beneficial and adverse effects of gutamate receptor
antagonists. To investigate this matter further, the novel competitive NMDA
antagonist CGP40.116 was administered systemically to three adult MPTP-treated
marmosets. When coadministered subcutaneously with a subthreshold dose of L-DOPA,
2 mg/kg, CGP40.116 25-250 micrograms/kg, increased locomotor activity. However,
when administered alone, CGP40.116 had no effect on locomotor activity.

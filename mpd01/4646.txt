X-ray-induced translocations in marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) stem-cell
spermatogonia.

van Buul PP.

The induction of reciprocal translocations in spermatogonial stem cells of
marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) was studied after irradiation with different doses
of X-rays (50, 100 and 200 rad) via spermatocyte analysis many cell generations
later. The obtained results show a dose-effect relationship with clear saturation
effects at 200 rad. The recorded frequencies of translocations were much lower
than those reported for closely related marmosets (Saguinus fuscicollis and
Saguinus oepidus). Possible reasons for this difference are discussed.

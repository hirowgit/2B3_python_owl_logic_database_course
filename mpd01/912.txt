Parkinson's disease is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder with the core motor
features of resting tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity, and postural instability.
Non-motor symptoms also occur, and include cognitive dysfunction, mood disorders,
anosmia (loss of smell), and REM sleep disturbances. As the development of
medications and other therapies for treatment of non-motor symptoms is ongoing,
it is essential to have animal models that aid in understanding the neural
changes underlying non-motor PD symptoms and serve as a testing ground for
potential therapeutics. We investigated several non-motor symptoms in 10 adult
male marmosets using the MPTP model, with both the full (n=5) and partial (n=5)
MPTP dosing regimens. Baseline data in numerous domains were collected prior to
dosing; assessments in these same domains occurred post-dosing for 12 weeks.
Marmosets given the partial MPTP dose (designed to mimic the early stages of the 
disease) differed significantly from marmosets given the full MPTP dose in
several ways, including behavior, olfactory discrimination, cognitive
performance, and social responses. Importantly, while spontaneous recovery of PD 
motor symptoms has been previously reported in studies of MPTP monkeys and cats, 
we did not observe recovery of any non-motor symptoms. This suggests that the
neurochemical mechanisms behind the non-motor symptoms of PD, which appear years 
before the onset of symptoms, are independent of the striatal dopaminergic
transmission. We demonstrate the value of assessing a broad range of behavioral
change to detect non-motor impairment, anosmia, and differences in socially
appropriate responses, in the marmoset MPTP model of early PD.

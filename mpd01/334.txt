The history of each human chromosome can be studied through comparative
cytogenetic approaches in mammals which permit the identification of human
chromosomal homologies and rearrangements between species. Comparative banding,
chromosome painting, Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC) mapping and genome
data permit researchers to formulate hypotheses about ancestral chromosome forms.
Human chromosome 13 has been previously shown to be conserved as a single
syntenic element in the Ancestral Primate Karyotype; in this context, in order to
study and verify the conservation of primate chromosomes homologous to human
chromosome 13, we mapped a selected set of BAC probes in three platyrrhine
species, characterised by a high level of rearrangements, using fluorescence in
situ hybridisation (FISH). Our mapping data on Saguinus oedipus, Callithrix
argentata and Alouatta belzebul provide insight into synteny of human chromosome 
13 evolution in a comparative perspective among primate species, showing
rearrangements across taxa. Furthermore, in a wider perspective, we have revised 
previous cytogenomic literature data on chromosome 13 evolution in eutherian
mammals, showing a complex origin of the eutherian mammal ancestral karyotype
which has still not been completely clarified. Moreover, we analysed biomedical
aspects (the OMIM and Mitelman databases) regarding human chromosome 13, showing 
that this autosome is characterised by a certain level of plasticity that has
been implicated in many human cancers and diseases.

BACKGROUND: The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is one of the most studied
primate model organisms. However, the marmoset genomes available in the public
databases are highly fragmented and filled with sequence gaps, hindering research
advances related to marmoset genomics and transcriptomics.
RESULTS: Here we utilize single-molecule, long-read sequence data to improve and 
update the existing genome assembly and report a near-complete genome of the
common marmoset. The assembly is of 2.79 Gb size, with a contig N50 length of
6.37 Mb and a chromosomal scaffold N50 length of 143.91 Mb, representing the most
contiguous and high-quality marmoset genome up to date. Approximately 90% of the 
assembled genome was represented in contigs longer than 1 Mb, with approximately 
104-fold improvement in contiguity over the previously published marmoset genome.
More than 98% of the gaps from the previously published genomes were filled
successfully, which improved the mapping rates of genomic and transcriptomic data
on to the assembled genome.
CONCLUSIONS: Altogether the updated, high-quality common marmoset genome assembly
provide improvements at various levels over the previous versions of the marmoset
genome assemblies. This will allow researchers working on primate genomics to
apply the genome more efficiently for their genomic and transcriptomic sequence
data.

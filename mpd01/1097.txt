Spatial tuning properties of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) are sharpened by
lateral inhibition originating at both the outer and inner plexiform layers.
Lateral inhibition in the retina contributes to local contrast enhancement and
sharpens edges. In this study, we used dynamic clamp recordings to examine the
contribution of inner plexiform inhibition, originating from spiking amacrine
cells, to the spatial tuning of RGCs. This was achieved by injecting currents
generated from physiologically recorded excitatory and inhibitory stimulus-evoked
conductances, into different types of primate and mouse RGCs. We determined the
effects of injections of size-dependent conductances in which presynaptic
inhibition and/or direct inhibition onto RGCs were partly removed by blocking the
activity of spiking amacrine cells. We found that inhibition originating from
spiking amacrine cells onto bipolar cell terminals and onto RGCs, work together
to sharpen the spatial tuning of RGCs. Furthermore, direct inhibition is crucial 
for preventing spike generation at stimulus offset. These results reveal how
inhibitory mechanisms in the inner plexiform layer contribute to determining size
tuning and provide specificity to stimulus polarity.

Cerebral dopamine neurotrophic factor (CDNF) belongs to a newly discovered family
of evolutionarily conserved neurotrophic factors. We demonstrate for the first
time a therapeutic effect of CDNF in a unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)
lesion model of Parkinson's disease in marmoset monkeys. Furthermore, we tested
the impact of high chronic doses of human recombinant CDNF on unlesioned monkeys 
and analyzed the amino acid sequence of marmoset CDNF. The severity of 6-OHDA
lesions and treatment effects were monitored in vivo using 123I-FP-CIT (DaTSCAN) 
SPECT. Quantitative analysis of 123I-FP-CIT SPECT showed a significant increase
of dopamine transporter binding activity in lesioned animals treated with CDNF.
Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), a well-characterized and
potent neurotrophic factor for dopamine neurons, served as a control in a
parallel comparison with CDNF. By contrast with CDNF, only single animals
responded to the treatment with GDNF, but no statistical difference was observed 
in the GDNF group. However, increased numbers of tyrosine hydroxylase
immunoreactive neurons, observed within the lesioned caudate nucleus of
GDNF-treated animals, indicate a strong bioactive potential of GDNF.

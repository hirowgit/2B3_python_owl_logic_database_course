Species and sex differences in susceptibility to vincristine sulphate
(VCR)-induced olfactory epithelial lesions were investigated among the BALB/c
mice, Crj: CD(SD) IGS rats and common marmoset monkeys following a single
intravenous administration on day 1. As dosage levels, the 0.17-fold LD10,
0.6-fold LD10 and LD10 were used for mice and rats, and a maximum tolerated dose 
(MTD) was chosen only for monkeys. The order of strength of VCR action on
peripheral neuropathic signs, body weight gain, and hematological parameters was 
mice > rats > monkeys, without clear sex differences. Histopathologically, on day
2, single cell death in the olfactory epithelium and vomeronasal organ was
observed only in male mice at LD10, and in female mice at 0.6-fold LD10 or more. 
On day 5, the olfactory epithelium in these mice showed regenerative
proliferation suggesting a sign of recovery. On day 10, axonopathy and
demyelination in the sciatic and trigeminal nerves were noted in mice of both
sexes at 0.6-fold LD10 or more. In rats and monkeys of either sex, however, no
morphological changes were observed at any dose level. In conclusion, mice,
particularly females, were shown to be more susceptible to VCR-induced apoptosis 
in the olfactory epithelium than rats and monkeys.

OBJECTIVE: To determine sildenafil citrate (SC) genotoxicity and cytotoxicity in 
the Callithrix jacchus.
STUDY DESIGN: Fifteen organisms were assigned to one of three groups as follows: 
experimental (25 mg/kg of SC); negative control (glucose solution 5%); and
positive control (3 mg/kg of cytocine arabinoside). Systemic hemodynamic changes 
were monitored in each animal before and after each treatment. A drop of blood
was obtained before and after the treatment at 24-120 h. Smears were made and the
frequency of micronucleated erythrocytes (MNE), micronucleated polychromatic
erythrocytes (MNPCE) and polychromatic erythrocytes (PCE) was counted.
RESULTS: No significant differences in MNE, MNPCE and PCE were found in the group
that received sildenafil and negative control. A significant increase in
genotoxicity and cytotoxicity was observed in the positive control group. No
changes were observed in systemic hemodynamic changes.
CONCLUSION: The macro-dose of SC lacks genotoxic, cytotoxic or systemic
hemodynamic changes effects in this species.

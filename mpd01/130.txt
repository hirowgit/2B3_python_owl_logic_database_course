Humans have used non-human primates (hereafter referred to as primates) as food
source, medicine, parts of rituals, pets, and models for various studies
worldwide. Here we investigated the extent of the use of primates by humans in
three areas in northeastern Brazil, the country's most impoverished region. We
carried out our study in three biomes (Caatinga, Cerrado, and Atlantic Forest).
The results showed that humans exploited all five primate species occurring in
the study sites: Callithrix jacchus, Sapajus flavius, Sapajus
libidinosus, Alouatta belzebul, and Alouatta ululata. They used the primates as a
food source, as pets and medicines, and for leisure. Despite socioeconomic
differences in the study areas, we found similarities in the use of primates.
Larger primates were targeted for meat, whereas the small common marmosets were
targeted as pets. We found conflicting interactions between humans and bearded
capuchins due to crop raiding, but no such conflict was found between humans and 
blonde capuchins, reflecting the differences in crop type, pattern, and tradition
in the sites. A. ululata was used as medicine. We suggest that environmental
education actions in the study areas should focus on (i) raising awareness among 
local people of the ecological importance of primates, (ii) providing alternative
activities to hunting whenever possible, and (iii) minimising conflicts.

Inclusion bodies (IBs) and multinucleate cells can be associated with viral
infections; however, IBs and multinucleate cells have been described in normal
tissue and with non-viral disease processes in multiple species. We examined
fundic stomach from 50 callitrichids histologically for bi- and multinucleate
parietal cells and cytoplasmic IBs in gastric epithelial cells. Callitrichids
represented included 6 genera: Saguinus (4 spp.), Leontopithecus (1 sp.), Mico (3
spp.), Cebuella (1 sp.), Callithrix (1 sp.), Callimico (1 sp.), and 13
unspecified marmosets. Gastric epithelial IBs were present in 46 of 47 (98%) of
the callitrichids from which the stomach was sufficiently well preserved to
identify IBs. Cytoplasmic IBs were identified in gastric surface pit epithelial
cells (43 of 44, 98%), mucous neck cells (43 of 44, 98%), parietal cells (43 of
44, 98%), and chief cells (43 of 44, 98%). The IBs were eosinophilic, ovoid,
round, elongate, or variably indented, sometimes slightly refractile, and 1-6 ×
1-13 µm. IBs were sometimes perinuclear and molded around the nucleus. Electron
microscopy of the gastric epithelium of one marmoset indicated that IBs were
composed of intermediate filaments. The IBs did not stain with
immunohistochemical markers for cytokeratin AE1/AE3 or vimentin. Binucleate
parietal cells were found in 49 of 50 (98%) callitrichids, and multinucleate
parietal cells were observed in 40 of 49 (82%) callitrichids. Gastric epithelial 
cytoplasmic IBs and bi- and multinucleate parietal cells are likely a normal
finding in callitrichids, and, to our knowledge, have not been reported
previously.

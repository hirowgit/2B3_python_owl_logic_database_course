BACKGROUND: Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) of mammals lose the ability to
regenerate injured axons during postnatal maturation, but little is known about
the underlying molecular mechanisms.
OBJECTIVE: It remains of particular importance to understand the mechanisms of
axonal regeneration to develop new therapeutic approaches for nerve injuries.
METHODS: Retinas from newborn to adult monkeys (Callithrix jacchus)1 were
obtained immediately after death and cultured in vitro. Growths of axons were
monitored using microscopy and time-lapse video cinematography.
Immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, qRT-PCR, and genomics were performed to
characterize molecules associated with axonal regeneration and growth. A genomic 
screen was performed by using retinal explants versus native and non-regenerative
explants obtained from eye cadavers on the day of birth, and hybridizing the mRNA
with cross-reacting cDNA on conventional human microarrays. Followed the genomic 
screen, siRNA experiments were conducted to identify the functional involvement
of identified candidates.
RESULTS: Neuron-specific human ribonucleoprotein N (snRPN) was found to be a
potential regulator of impaired axonal regeneration during neuronal maturation in
these animals. In particular, up-regulation of snRPN was observed during retinal 
maturation, coinciding with a decline in regenerative ability. Axon regeneration 
was reactivated in snRPN-knockout retinal ex vivo explants of adult monkey.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that coordinated snRPN-driven activities within
the neuron-specific ribonucleoprotein complex regulate the regenerative ability
of RGCs in primates, thereby highlighting a potential new role for snRPN within
neurons and the possibility of novel postinjury therapies.

We present a new 3D digital brain atlas of the non-human primate, common marmoset
monkey (Callithrix jacchus), with MRI and coregistered Nissl histology data. To
the best of our knowledge this is the first comprehensive digital 3D brain atlas 
of the common marmoset having normalized multi-modal data, cortical and
sub-cortical segmentation, and in a common file format (NIfTI). The atlas can be 
registered to new data, is useful for connectomics, functional studies,
simulation and as a reference. The atlas was based on previously published work
but we provide several critical improvements to make this release valuable for
researchers. Nissl histology images were processed to remove illumination and
shape artifacts and then normalized to the MRI data. Brain region segmentation is
provided for both hemispheres. The data is in the NIfTI format making it easy to 
integrate into neuroscience pipelines, whereas the previous atlas was in an
inaccessible file format. We also provide cortical, mid-cortical and white matter
boundary segmentations useful for visualization and analysis.

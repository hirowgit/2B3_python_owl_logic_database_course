Serum cobalamin and folate concentrations can serve as surrogate markers of
gastrointestinal disease in dogs and cats, where they can have diagnostic,
therapeutic, and prognostic implications. Chronic disease of the gastrointestinal
tract, particularly chronic lymphocytic enteritis (CLE), occurs frequently in
captive common marmosets. The aims of this study were to validate a commercially 
available assay for measuring serum cobalamin and folate concentrations in common
marmosets, to establish reference intervals for these analytes in healthy
marmosets, and to measure serum concentrations in common marmosets with CLE. The 
commercial assay was linear, accurate, precise, and reproducible for the
measurement of serum cobalamin and folate concentrations in common marmosets. In 
healthy marmosets, the serum cobalamin concentration ranged from 322 to 2642
pg/mL (n = 35) and serum folate concentration from 54.8 to 786.4 ng/mL (n = 37). 
Low serum folate concentrations were moderately sensitive (greater than 70%) for 
CLE, and low serum cobalamin concentrations were moderately (greater than 70%)
specific for CLE. Both serum cobalamin and folate concentrations were relatively 
unchanged in marmosets during 120 to 220 d. Serum cobalamin and folate
concentrations were stable for approximately 7 y when samples were stored at -80 
Â°C. Additional studies are warranted to further study the clinical implications
of low serum cobalamin and folate concentrations in common marmosets.

In November 2015, an 83-d-old juvenile male common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) 
in good body condition was found dead in his family cage with no previous
premonitory signs. Necropsy revealed a gas-distended abdomen, feces-distended
large bowel, and a full-thickness distal colonic perforation resulting in fecal
peritonitis. The distal colon ended in a blind pouch at 7 mm prior to the
expected anal opening, consistent with atresia ani. Here we present this case,
briefly discuss the human and veterinary literature regarding correction of
anorectal malformations, and highlight the importance of identifying such
devastating congenital defects in breeding colonies while limiting the disruption
and handling of seemingly healthy, young NHP raised in a complex social setting.

Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) continues to be a threat 
to human health in the Middle East. Development of countermeasures is ongoing;
however, an animal model that faithfully recapitulates human disease has yet to
be defined. A recent study indicated that inoculation of common marmosets
resulted in inconsistent lethality. Based on these data we sought to compare two 
isolates of MERS-CoV. We followed disease progression in common marmosets after
intratracheal exposure with: MERS-CoV-EMC/2012, MERS-CoV-Jordan-n3/2012, media,
or inactivated virus. Our data suggest that common marmosets developed a mild to 
moderate non-lethal respiratory disease, which was quantifiable by computed
tomography (CT), with limited other clinical signs. Based on CT data, clinical
data, and virological data, MERS-CoV inoculation of common marmosets results in
mild to moderate clinical signs of disease that are likely due to manipulations
of the marmoset rather than as a result of robust viral replication.

Severe dengue disease is often associated with long-term neurological
impairments, but it is unclear what mechanisms are associated with neurological
sequelae. Previously, we demonstrated antibody-enhanced dengue disease (ADE)
dengue in an immunocompetent mouse model with a dengue virus 2 (DENV2) antibody
injection followed by DENV3 virus infection. Here we migrated this ADE model to
Callithrix penicillata. To mimic human multiple infections of endemic zones where
abundant vectors and multiple serotypes co-exist, three animals received weekly
subcutaneous injections of DENV3 (genotype III)-infected supernatant of C6/36
cell cultures, followed 24 h later by anti-DENV2 antibody for 12 weeks. There
were six control animals, two of which received weekly anti-DENV2 antibodies, and
four further animals received no injections. After multiple infections, brain,
liver, and spleen samples were collected and tissue was immunolabeled for DENV3
antigens, ionized calcium binding adapter molecule 1, Ki-67, TNFα. There were
marked morphological changes in the microglial population of ADE monkeys
characterized by more highly ramified microglial processes, higher numbers of
trees and larger surface areas. These changes were associated with intense
TNFα-positive immunolabeling. It is unclear why ADE should generate such
microglial activation given that IgG does not cross the blood-brain barrier, but 
this study reveals that in ADE dengue therapy targeting the CNS host response is 
likely to be important.

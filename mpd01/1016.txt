Comparative cytogenetic analysis in New World Monkeys (NWMs) using human
multicolor banding (MCB) probe sets were not previously done. Here we report on
an MCB based FISH-banding study complemented with selected locus-specific and
heterochromatin specific probes in four NWMs and one Old World Monkey (OWM)
species, i.e. in Alouatta caraya (ACA), Callithrix jacchus (CJA), Cebus apella
(CAP), Saimiri sciureus (SSC), and Chlorocebus aethiops (CAE), respectively. 107 
individual evolutionary conserved breakpoints (ECBs) among those species were
identified and compared with those of other species in previous reports.
Especially for chromosomal regions being syntenic to human chromosomes 6, 8, 9,
10, 11, 12 and 16 previously cryptic rearrangements could be observed. 50.4%
(54/107) NWM-ECBs were colocalized with those of OWMs, 62.6% (62/99) NWM-ECBs
were related with those of Hylobates lar (HLA) and 66.3% (71/107) NWM-ECBs
corresponded with those known from other mammalians. Furthermore, human fragile
sites were aligned with the ECBs found in the five studied species and
interestingly 66.3% ECBs colocalized with those fragile sites (FS). Overall, this
study presents detailed chromosomal maps of one OWM and four NWM species. This
data will be helpful to further investigation on chromosome evolution in NWM and 
hominoids in general and is prerequisite for correct interpretation of future
sequencing based genomic studies in those species.

1. A cDNA encoding novel cytochrome P450 (P450) 4A enzyme was cloned from
marmoset livers by reverse transcription (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
based on the marmoset genome sequences. The amino acid sequence deduced from P450
4A11 cDNA contained consensus sequences of six substrate recognition sites and
one heme-binding domain. 2. Marmoset P450 4A11, highly identical (85-88%) to
cynomolgus monkey and human P450 4A enzymes, was grouped into the same cluster as
cynomolgus monkey and human P450 4A enzymes by phylogenetic analysis. 3. The
tissue distribution analyses by real-time RT PCR and immunoblotting demonstrated 
that marmoset P450 4A11 mRNA and proteins were expressed in kidneys and livers.
Marmoset P450 4A11 enzyme heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli
preferentially catalyzed the ω-hydroxylation of arachidonic acid and lauric acid,
similar to cynomolgus monkey and human P450 4A11 enzymes. However, lauric acid
ω-hydroxylation activity of marmoset P450 4A11 was low compared with those of
marmoset liver microsomes. 4. These results indicated that novel marmoset P450
4A11 was also a fatty acid ω-hydroxylase expressed in kidneys and livers, with
the same regioselectivity (at ω-position of fatty acid) as cynomolgus monkey and 
human P450 4A enzymes.

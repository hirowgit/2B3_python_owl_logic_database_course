Vocal development is usually studied from the perspective of neuroscience. In
this issue, Zhang and Ghazanfar propose a way in which body growth might
condition the process. They study the vocalizations of marmoset infants with a
wide range of techniques that include computational models and experiments that
mimic growth reversal. Their results suggest that the qualitative changes that
occur during development are rooted in the nonlinear interaction between the
nervous system and the biomechanics involved in respiration. This work
illustrates how an integrative approach enriches our understanding of behavior.

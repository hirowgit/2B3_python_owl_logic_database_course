Bacteria of the genus Ehrlichia are Gram-negative and coccoid-shaped
microorganisms that cause ehrlichiosis - a serious infectious disease that often 
leads to death. These bacteria present a strong zoonotic potential and primates
may act as reservoir hosts. This study involved a molecular analysis to detect
these microorganisms in blood samples collected from nineteen primates of the
genus Callithrix living free in an Atlantic Forest fragment in the municipality
of Viçosa, state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. One of the 19 primates was found to be 
infected with Ehrlichia canis. This finding points to a new wild host of E. canis
with a strong potential for transmission to humans because of its increasing
contact with people. This is the first report of Ehrlichia spp. in primate of the
genus Callithrix.

Conversational turn-taking is an integral part of language development, as it
reflects a confluence of social factors that mitigate communication. Humans
coordinate the timing of speech based on the behaviour of another speaker, a
behaviour that is learned during infancy. While adults in several primate species
engage in vocal turn-taking, the degree to which similar learning processes
underlie its development in these non-human species or are unique to language is 
not clear. We recorded the natural vocal interactions of common marmosets
(Callithrix jacchus) occurring with both their sibling twins and parents over the
first year of life and observed at least two parallels with language development.
First, marmoset turn-taking is a learned vocal behaviour. Second, marmoset
parents potentially played a direct role in guiding the development of
turn-taking by providing feedback to their offspring when errors occurred during 
vocal interactions similarly to what has been observed in humans. Though
species-differences are also evident, these findings suggest that similar
learning mechanisms may be implemented in the ontogeny of vocal turn-taking
across our Order, a finding that has important implications for our understanding
of language evolution.

BACKGROUND: Marmosets are a powerful, emerging model for human behavior and
neurological disorders. However, longitudinal imaging modalities that visualize
both cellular structure and function within the cortex are not available in this 
animal model. Hence, we implemented an approach to quantify vascular topology,
hemodynamics, and neural activity in awake marmosets using two-photon microscopy 
(2PM).
NEW METHOD: Marmosets were acclimated to a custom stereotaxic system.
AAV1-GCaMP5G was injected into somatosensory cortex to optically indicate neural 
activity, and a cranial chamber was implanted.
RESULTS: Longitudinal 2PM revealed vasculature and neurons 500μm below the
cortical surface. Vascular response and neural activity during sensory
stimulation were preserved over 5 and 3 months, respectively, before optical
quality deteriorated. Vascular remodeling including increased tortuosity and
branching was quantified. However, capillary connectivity from arterioles to
venules remained unchanged. Further, behavioral assessment before and after
surgery demonstrated no impact on cognitive and motor function.
Immunohistochemistry confirmed minimal astrocyte activation with no focal damage.
Over 6 months, total cortical depth visualized decreased. When under anesthesia, 
the most prominent isoflurane-induced vasodilation occurred in capillaries and
smaller arterioles.
COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHOD(S): These results demonstrate the capability to
repeatedly observe cortical physiology in awake marmosets over months.
CONCLUSIONS: This work provides a novel and insightful technique to investigate
critical mechanisms in neurological disorders in awake marmosets without
introducing confounds from anesthesia.

Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are useful for the study of embryonic development.
However, since research on naturally conceived human embryos is limited,
non-human primate (NHP) embryos and NHP ESCs represent an excellent alternative
to the corresponding human entities. Though, ESC lines derived from naturally
conceived NHP embryos are still very rare. Here, we report the generation and
characterization of four novel ESC lines derived from natural preimplantation
embryos of the common marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus). For the first time we
document derivation of NHP ESCs derived from morula stages. We show that
quantitative chromosome-wise transcriptome analyses precisely reflect trisomies
present in both morula-derived ESC lines. We also demonstrate that the female ESC
lines exhibit different states of X-inactivation which is impressively reflected 
by the abundance of the lncRNA X inactive-specific transcript (XIST). The novel
marmoset ESC lines will promote basic primate embryo and ESC studies as well as
preclinical testing of ESC-based regenerative approaches in NHP.

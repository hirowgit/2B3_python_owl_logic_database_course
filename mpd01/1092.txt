1.窶サhe pharmacokinetic data of cytochrome P450 probes in humans can be
extrapolated from corresponding data in cynomolgus monkeys, dogs and minipigs
using simplified physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling. In this
study, the modeling methodology was further adapted to estimate human plasma
concentrations of P450 probes based on data from mice transplanted with human
hepatocytes or based on data from marmosets. 2.窶ザsing known species allometric
scaling factors, the observed plasma concentrations of caffeine, warfarin,
omeprazole, metoprolol, and midazolam in chimeric TK-NOG mice with humanized
liver were scaled to human oral monitoring equivalents. Using the same approach, 
the previously reported pharmacokinetics of the five P450 probes in marmosets
were also scaled to reported equivalents in humans using in vitro metabolic
clearance data. 3.窶ォuman plasma concentration profiles of the five P450 probes
estimated by simplified human PBPK models based on the observed pharmacokinetics 
in mice with humanized liver and on the reported pharmacokinetics in marmosets
were consistent with previously published pharmacokinetic data in Caucasians.
4.窶サhese results suggest that mice with humanized liver and/or marmosets could be
suitable pharmacokinetic models for humans during research into new drugs,
especially when used in combination with simple PBPK models.

Hearing impairment is the most frequent sensory deficit in humans. Deafness
genes, which harbor pathogenic mutations that have been identified in families
with hereditary hearing loss, are commonly expressed in the auditory end organ or
the cochlea and may contribute to normal hearing function, yet some of the mouse 
models carrying these mutations fail to recapitulate the hearing loss phenotype. 
In this study, we find that distinct expression patterns of those deafness genes 
in the cochlea of a non-human primate, the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). 
We examined 20 genes whose expression in the cochlea has already been reported.
The deafness genes GJB3, CRYM, GRHL2, DFNA5, and ATP6B1 were expressed in
marmoset cochleae in patterns different from those in mouse cochleae. Of note,
all those genes are causative for progressive hearing loss in humans, but not in 
mice. The other tested genes, including the deafness gene COCH, in which mutation
recapitulates deafness in mice, were expressed in a similar manner in both
species. The result suggests that the discrepancy in the expression between
rodents and primates may account for the phenotypic difference. This limitation
of the rodent models can be bypassed by using non-human primate models such as
the marmoset.

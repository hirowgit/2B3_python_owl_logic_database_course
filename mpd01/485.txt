Understanding the set of factors that promote and constrain a species' ability to
exploit ecologically distinct habitats is central for addressing questions of
intraspecific variability in behavior and morphology. In this study, we compared 
newly collected data with published data on body measurements, group size and
composition, daily path length, home range, and reproductive output in wild
common marmosets naturally inhabiting two contrasting environments in
northeastern Brazil: the Atlantic Forest (AF), which is characterized by high
biodiversity and reduced seasonality in food availability and the Caatinga (CAT),
which is characterized by a severe hot and dry season lasting from 5 to 11
months, drought-resistant plant species, and reduced primary productivity.
Despite marked differences in ecological conditions, CAT marmosets and AF
marmosets differed minimally in daily path length, home range, reproductive
output, and infant survivorship. CAT marmosets were found to live in smaller
groups containing fewer adult females than AF marmosets, and also were
characterized by a greater surface area to body mass ratio, a trait that may
represent an adaptation to the hot and dry conditions of the Caatinga. We propose
that in conjunction with body mass reduction, minor adjustments in behavior, the 
exploitation of cacti as a source of water and nutrients, and access to exudates 
as a dependable year-round food resource, common marmosets successfully used the 
same adaptive pattern to maintain high reproductive output and infant
survivorship in exploiting these two ecologically distinct environments.

The historical view of β-lactams as ineffective antimycobacterials has given way 
to growing interest in the activity of this class against Mycobacterium
tuberculosis (Mtb) in the presence of a β-lactamase inhibitor. However, most
antimycobacterial β-lactams kill Mtb only or best when the bacilli are
replicating. Here, a screen of 1904 β-lactams led to the identification of
cephalosporins substituted with a pyrithione moiety at C3' that are active
against Mtb under both replicating and nonreplicating conditions, neither
activity requiring a β-lactamase inhibitor. Studies showed that activity against 
nonreplicating Mtb required the in situ release of the pyrithione, independent of
the known class A β-lactamase, BlaC. In contrast, replicating Mtb could be killed
both by released pyrithione and by the parent β-lactam. Thus, the
antimycobacterial activity of pyrithione-containing cephalosporins arises from
two mechanisms that kill mycobacteria in different metabolic states.

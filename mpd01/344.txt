In Brazil, rabies occurs mainly within an urban cycle, in which dogs and bats are
reservoirs. This paper aims to report the occurrence of rabies in Callithrix sp. 
in Niterói, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. In June 2019 a hybrid specimen was referred
for diagnosis. The Direct Fluorescent Antibody, Mouse Inoculation, and Polymerase
Chain Reaction tests were positive. A phylogenetic analysis was compatible with
antigenic variant 3, characteristic of Desmodus rotundus. New studies should be
undertaken to elucidate the real role of callitrichids in the urban rabies cycle.

Any transmission of vocal signals faces the challenge of acoustic interferences
such as heavy rain, wind, animal or urban sounds. Consequently, several
mechanisms and strategies have evolved to optimize signal-to-noise ratio.
Examples to increase detectability are the Lombard effect, an involuntary rise in
call amplitude in response to masking ambient noise, which is often associated
with other vocal changes such as call frequency and duration, as well as the
animals' capability of limiting calling to periods where noise perturbation is
absent. Previous studies revealed vocal flexibility and various audio-vocal
integration mechanisms in marmoset monkeys. Using acoustic perturbation triggered
by vocal behaviour, we investigated whether marmosets are capable of exhibiting
changes in call structure when perturbing noise starts after call onset or
whether such effects only occur if noise perturbation starts prior to call onset.
We show that marmosets are capable of rapidly modulating call amplitude and
frequency in response to such noise perturbation. Vocalizations swiftly increased
call frequency after noise onset indicating a rapid effect of perturbing noise on
vocal motor production. Call amplitudes were also affected. Interestingly,
however, the marmosets did not exhibit the Lombard effect as previously reported 
but decreased call intensity in response to noise. Our findings indicate that
marmosets possess a general avoidance strategy to call in the presence of ambient
noise and suggest that these animals are capable of counteracting a previously
thought involuntary audio-vocal mechanism, the Lombard effect. These findings
will pave the way to investigate the underlying audio-vocal integration
mechanisms explaining these behaviours.

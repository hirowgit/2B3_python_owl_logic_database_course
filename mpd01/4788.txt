Chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis and wasting disease in marmosets (Callithrix
jacchus).

Brack M, Rothe H.

Six marmosets (Callithrix jacchus), 20 months to 16 years old, died from a
disease characterized by weakness and paralysis of the hind legs, weight lose,
anemia and transient diarrhea. The lesions most prominent at necropsy were
subacute to chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis, subacute to chronic
pancreatitis, and generalized hemosiderosis. Chronic protein deficiency is
believed to be the underlying pathogenic mechanism, since the diet contained no
more than 15% animal protein during the last two years, and increasing the amount
of protein was accompanied by disappearance of the syndrome.

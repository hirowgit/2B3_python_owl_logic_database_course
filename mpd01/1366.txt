PURPOSE: Bifocal contact lenses were used to impose hyperopic and myopic defocus 
on the peripheral retina of marmosets. Eye growth and refractive state were
compared with untreated animals and those treated with single-vision or multizone
contact lenses from earlier studies.
METHODS: Thirty juvenile marmosets wore one of three experimental annular bifocal
contact lens designs on their right eyes and a plano contact lens on the left eye
as a control for 10 weeks from 70 days of age (10 marmosets/group). The
experimental designs had plano center zones (1.5 or 3 mm) and +5 diopters [D] or 
-5 D in the periphery (referred to as +5 D/1.5 mm, +5 D/3 mm and -5 D/3 mm). We
measured the central and peripheral mean spherical refractive error (MSE),
vitreous chamber depth (VC), pupil diameter (PD), calculated eye growth, and
myopia progression rates prior to and during treatment. The results were compared
with age-matched untreated (N=25), single-vision positive (N=19), negative
(N=16), and +5/-5 D multizone lens-reared marmosets (N=10).
RESULTS: At the end of treatment, animals in the -5 D/3 mm group had larger
(P<0.01) and more myopic eyes (P<0.05) than animals in the +5 D/1.5 mm group.
There was a dose-dependent relationship between the peripheral treatment zone
area and the treatment-induced changes in eye growth and refractive state.
Pretreatment ocular growth rates and baseline peripheral refraction accounted for
40% of the induced refraction and axial growth rate changes.
CONCLUSIONS: Eye growth and refractive state can be manipulated by altering
peripheral retinal defocus. Imposing peripheral hyperopic defocus produces axial 
myopia, whereas peripheral myopic defocus produces axial hyperopia. The effects
are smaller than using single-vision contact lenses that impose full-field
defocus, but support the use of bifocal or multifocal contact lenses as an
effective treatment for myopia control.

Studies of social learning and tradition formation under field conditions have
recently gained momentum, but suffer from the limited control of socio-ecological
factors thought to be responsible for transmission patterns. The use of
artificial visual stimuli is a potentially powerful tool to overcome some of
these problems. Here, in a field experiment, we used video images of unfamiliar
conspecifics performing virtual demonstrations of foraging techniques. We tested 
12 family groups of wild common marmosets. Six groups received video
demonstrations (footage of conspecifics either pulling a drawer open or pushing a
lid upwards, in an 'artificial fruit'); the other six groups served as controls
(exposed to a static image of a conspecific next to the fruit). Subjects in video
groups were more manipulative and successful in opening the fruit than controls; 
they were also more likely to use the technique they had witnessed and thus could
serve as live models for other family members. To our knowledge, this is the
first study that used video demonstrations in the wild and demonstrated the
potent force of social learning, even from unfamiliar conspecifics, under field
conditions.

Two-photon imaging with genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) enables
long-term observation of neuronal activity in vivo. However, there are very few
studies of GECIs in primates. Here, we report a method for long-term imaging of a
GECI, GCaMP6f, expressed from adeno-associated virus vectors in cortical neurons 
of the adult common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a small New World primate. We 
used a tetracycline-inducible expression system to robustly amplify neuronal
GCaMP6f expression and up- and downregulate it for more than 100 days. We
succeeded in monitoring spontaneous activity not only from hundreds of neurons
three-dimensionally distributed in layers 2 and 3 but also from single dendrites 
and axons in layer 1. Furthermore, we detected selective activities from somata, 
dendrites, and axons in the somatosensory cortex responding to specific tactile
stimuli. Our results provide a way to investigate the organization and plasticity
of cortical microcircuits at subcellular resolution in non-human primates.

A biosensor detecting estrogens, progestogens, and androgens in complex samples
and in a single step is described. Three Arxula adeninivorans yeast strains were 
created, each strain producing a different recombinant human hormone receptor and
a different fluorescent reporter protein. These strains were then mixed to create
G1212/YRC102-hHR-fluo, the biological component of the biosensor. During
incubation with G1212/YRC102-hHR-fluo, hormones present in a sample bind to their
target receptor, which leads to the production of a specific fluorescent protein.
Three fluorescence scans of the yeast suspension determine which fluorescence
protein has been produced, thus revealing which hormone receptor (estrogen,
progesterone, and androgen) has been activated by the hormones or hormone mimics 
present in the sample. The biosensor has similar sensitivities to the existing A.
adeninivorans cell-based assays. The detection of the three hormone classes in
one single experiment reduces the labor and time required to assay for the three 
hormone classes. The biosensor was also trialed with animal serum samples for the
detection of progestogens, androgens, and estrogens and gave results that
correlated well with ELISA analysis in case of progestogens. These results
highlight the potential usefulness of the biosensor for comprehensive
determination of hormone status in samples from veterinary origin. Biotechnol.

Vocalizations of human infants undergo dramatic changes across the first year by 
becoming increasingly mature and speech-like. Human vocal development is
partially dependent on learning by imitation through social feedback between
infants and caregivers. Recent studies revealed similar developmental processes
being influenced by parental feedback in marmoset monkeys for apparently innate
vocalizations. Marmosets produce infant-specific vocalizations that disappear
after the first postnatal months. However, it is yet unclear whether parental
feedback is an obligate requirement for proper vocal development. Using
quantitative measures to compare call parameters and vocal sequence structure we 
show that, in contrast to normally raised marmosets, marmosets that were
separated from parents after the third postnatal month still produced
infant-specific vocal behaviour at subadult stages. These findings suggest a
significant role of social feedback on primate vocal development until the
subadult stages and further show that marmoset monkeys are a compelling model
system for early human vocal development.

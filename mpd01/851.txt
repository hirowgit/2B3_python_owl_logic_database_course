The aim of this study was to provide a detailed anatomical description of the
abdomen in the clinically normal common marmoset by means of computed tomography 
(CT). Eight clinically healthy mature common marmosets ranging from 12 to
48 months and 235 to 365 g bodyweight were anesthetized and pre- and
post-contrast CT examinations were performed using different CT settings in
dorsal recumbency. Abdominal organs were identified and visibility noted.
Diagnostic quality abdominal images could be obtained of the common marmoset
despite its small size using a dual-slice CT scanner. Representative
cross-sectional images were chosen from different animals illustrating the
abdominal CT anatomy of clinically normal common marmosets. Identification or
delineation of abdominal organs greatly improved with i.v. contrast. A modified
high-frequency algorithm with edge enhancement added valuable information for
identification of small structures such as the ureters. The Hounsfield unit (HU) 
of major abdominal organs differed from that of small animals (domestic dogs and 
cats). Due to their size and different anatomy, standard small animal CT
protocols need to be critically assessed and adapted for exotics, such as the
common marmoset. The established normal reference range of HU of major abdominal 
organs and adapted settings for a CT protocol will aid clinical assessment of the
common marmoset.

Subcellular resolution imaging of the whole brain and subsequent image analysis
are prerequisites for understanding anatomical and functional brain networks.
Here, we have developed a very high-speed serial-sectioning imaging system named 
FAST (block-face serial microscopy tomography), which acquires high-resolution
images of a whole mouse brain in a speed range comparable to that of light-sheet 
fluorescence microscopy. FAST enables complete visualization of the brain at a
resolution sufficient to resolve all cells and their subcellular structures. FAST
renders unbiased quantitative group comparisons of normal and disease model brain
cells for the whole brain at a high spatial resolution. Furthermore, FAST is
highly scalable to non-human primate brains and human postmortem brain tissues,
and can visualize neuronal projections in a whole adult marmoset brain. Thus,
FAST provides new opportunities for global approaches that will allow for a
better understanding of brain systems in multiple animal models and in human
diseases.

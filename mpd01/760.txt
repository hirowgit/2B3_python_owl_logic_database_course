With the loss and fragmentation of tropical forests, the survival of primates
depends on their ability to adapt to human-introduced modifications in their
habitat. Marmosets are known for their ecological and behavioral plasticity and
have been registered in various agricultural landscapes. Our goal was to describe
the ecology of tufted-ear marmosets (Callithrix sp.) in a rubber/forest
landscape, monitoring their use of habitat and diet. We followed two groups using
radio telemetry and visual observations for nine months at the Michelin
plantation Ltd. in Bahia, Brazil. Both groups used mainly pioneer forest and
rubber with pioneer vegetation more than expected according to availability, even
though they explored all types of vegetation. Rubber monocultures act as
corridors for marmoset locomotion among more suitable habitats. Feeding,
gummivory and socialization were mainly performed in the pioneer forest (with or 
without rubber), in which most sleeping sites and food sources were found. Groups
of marmosets can incorporate agroforest matrixes to their area of use and
activity patterns. Maintenance of marmosets in fragmented landscapes might be
favored by their diet flexibility, with the use of resources such as gum and
fruit, including exotic plants. Although known for their ecological flexibility, 
marmosets do require certain resources to be present in native habitat to adapt
to agricultural landscapes. Patches of forest within a rubber landscape and
pioneer vegetation in the rubber inter-rows should be considered to maintain
populations of Callithrix in rubber landscapes.

Cortisol levels are often used as a physiological measure of the stress response 
in captive primates, with non-invasive measures of this being an important step
in welfare assessment. We report a method of collecting saliva samples
voluntarily from unrestrained captive common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus), and 
validate an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique previously unused
in this species. Saliva samples were collected from marmosets housed in pairs in 
a UK laboratory. The assay showed parallelism, precision, accuracy and
sensitivity, meeting the criteria typically used to investigate the effectiveness
of new analytical techniques. Use of Salimetrics® Oral Swabs considerably
increased the amount of cortisol recovered in comparison with previous studies
using cotton buds. However, while use of banana on the swabs can encourage
chewing, it may influence results. Although increases in cortisol levels have
traditionally been interpreted as an indicator of stress in primates, there are
many factors that affect the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, with some
studies showing decreases in cortisol levels post-stressor. Following a likely
stressful event (capture for weighing), we also found cortisol levels
significantly decreased, possibly due to social buffering or 'blunting' of the
HPA axis. Order of weighing also had an effect. The method therefore provided an 
effective non-invasive means of assessing acute changes in cortisol level that
may be more useful than previous methods, improving our ability to study
physiological aspects of welfare in primates. We discuss methodological
considerations, as well as implications of using cortisol as a measure of stress.

The common marmoset is a small nonhuman primate in which the application of
transgenesis and genetic knockout techniques allows the generation of
gene-modified models of human diseases. However, its longer generation time than 
that of rodents is a major obstacle to the widespread use of gene-modified
marmosets for biomedical research. In this study, we examined the feasibility of 
shortening the generation time by using prepubertal marmoset males as gamete
donors. We collected late round stage spermatids (Steps 5-7), elongated
spermatids, and testicular spermatozoa from the testis of a prepubertal
11-month-old male marmoset and injected them into in vitro-matured oocytes. After
7 days in culture, two embryos from elongated spermatid injection and two embryos
from sperm injection were transferred into two separate recipient females. The
recipient female that received elongated spermatid injection-derived embryos
became pregnant and gave birth to one female infant. This is the first
demonstration that a spermatid from a prepubertal male primate can support
full-term development. Using this method, we can expect to obtain offspring of
gene-modified males 6 months to a year earlier than with natural mating.

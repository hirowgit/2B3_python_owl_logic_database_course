Genetic variation in the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4) is associated with
vulnerability to affective disorders and pharmacotherapy efficacy. We recently
identified sequence polymorphisms in the common marmoset SLC6A4 repeat region
(AC/C/G and CT/T/C) associated with individual differences in anxiety-like trait,
gene expression, and response to antidepressants. The mechanisms underlying the
effects of these polymorphisms are unknown, but a key mediator of serotonin
action is the serotonin 2A receptor (5HT2A). Thus, we correlated 5HT2A binding
potential (BP) and RNA gene expression in 16 SLC6A4 genotyped marmosets with
responsivity to 5HT2A antagonism during the human intruder test of anxiety.
Voxel-based analysis and RNA measurements showed a reduction in 5HT2A BP and gene
expression specifically in the right posterior insula of individuals homozygous
for the anxiety-related variant AC/C/G. These same marmosets displayed an
anxiogenic, dose-dependent response to the human intruder after 5HT2A
pharmacological antagonism, while CT/T/C individuals showed no effect. A
voxel-based correlation analysis, independent of SLC6A4 genotype, revealed that
5HT2A BP in the adjacent right anterior insula and insula proisocortex was
negatively correlated with trait anxiety scores. Moreover, 5HT2A BP in both
regions was a good predictor of the size and direction of the acute emotional
response to the human intruder threat after 5HT2A antagonism. Our findings
suggest that genetic variation in the SLC6A4 repeat region may contribute to the 
trait anxious phenotype via neurochemical changes in brain areas implicated in
interoceptive and emotional processing, with a critical role for the right insula
5HT2A in the regulation of affective responses to threat.

Sex differences in human cognitive performance are well characterized. However,
the neural correlates of these differences remain elusive. This issue may be
clarified using nonhuman primates, for which sociocultural influences are
minimized. We used the marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) to investigate sex
differences in two aspects of executive function: reversal learning and
intradimensional/extradimensional (ID/ED) set shifting. Stress reactivity and
motor function were also assessed. In agreement with human literature, females
needed more trials than males to acquire the reversals. No sex differences in ED 
set shifting or motivational measures were observed. The findings suggest
enhanced habit formation in females, perhaps due to striatal estrogenic effects. 
Both sexes showed increased urinary cortisol during social separation stressor,
but females showed an earlier increase in cortisol and a greater increase in
agitated locomotion, possibly indicating enhanced stress reactivity. Independent 
of sex, basal cortisol predicted cognitive performance. No sex differences were
found in motor performance. Associations between brain networks and reversal
learning performance were investigated using resting state fMRI. Resting state
functional connectivity (rsFC) analyses revealed sex differences in cognitive
networks, with differences in overall neural network metrics and specific
regions, including the prefrontal cortex, caudate, putamen, and nucleus
accumbens. Correlations between cognitive flexibility and neural connectivity
indicate that sex differences in cognitive flexibility are related to
sex-dependent patterns of resting brain networks. Overall, our findings reveal
sex differences in reversal learning, brain networks, and their relationship in
the marmoset, positioning this species as an excellent model to investigate the
biological basis of cognitive sex differences.

Fornix transection in the marmoset produces a specific pattern of cognitive
deficits, notably a lack of ability to recall visuospatial tasks learnt
preoperatively, and a deficit in acquiring new visuospatial tasks following
transection. Previous work has shown that this learning impairment can be
ameliorated by cholinergic agonists, suggesting that it occurs as a consequence
of destroying the cholinergic projection from the vertical limb of the diagonal
band to the hippocampus which runs through the fornix. We have now shown that
this deficit in new learning can be significantly alleviated by the 5-HT1A
antagonist, WAY 100635. This result supports the suggestion that 5-HT1A
projections are inhibitory on the same target cells for which cholinergic
projections are excitatory, and that loss of function in the target cells caused 
by loss of excitatory tone can be compensated by blockade of inhibitory tone.
Since cholinergic loss in the hippocampus (and neocortex) occurs in association
with cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease, these results suggest that 5-HT1A 
antagonists may have a role in the treatment of some of the cognitive symptoms of
dementia.

The pitch of vocalizations is a key communication feature aiding recognition of
individuals and separating sound sources in complex acoustic environments. The
neural representation of the pitch of periodic sounds is well defined. However,
many natural sounds, like complex vocalizations, contain rich, aperiodic or not
strictly periodic frequency content and/or include high-frequency components, but
still evoke a strong sense of pitch. Indeed, such sounds are the rule, not the
exception but the cortical mechanisms for encoding pitch of such sounds are
unknown. We investigated how neurons in the high-frequency representation of
primary auditory cortex (A1) of marmosets encoded changes in pitch of four
natural vocalizations, two centred around a dominant frequency similar to the
neuron's best sensitivity and two around a much lower dominant frequency. Pitch
was varied over a fine range that can be used by marmosets to differentiate
individuals. The responses of most high-frequency A1 neurons were sensitive to
pitch changes in all four vocalizations, with a smaller proportion of the neurons
showing pitch-insensitive responses. Classically defined excitatory drive, from
the neuron's monaural frequency response area, predicted responses to changes in 
vocalization pitch in <30% of neurons suggesting most pitch tuning observed is
not simple frequency-level response. Moreover, 39% of A1 neurons showed
call-invariant tuning of pitch. These results suggest that distributed activity
across A1 can represent the pitch of natural sounds over a fine, functionally
relevant range, and exhibits pitch tuning for vocalizations within and outside
the classical neural tuning area.

With increasing attention on the developmental causes of neuropsychiatric
disorders, appropriate animal models are crucial to identifying causes and
assessing potential interventions. The common marmoset is an ideal model as it
has sophisticated social/emotional behavior, reaching adulthood within 2 years of
birth. Magnetic resonance imaging was used in an accelerated longitudinal cohort 
(n = 41; aged 3-27 months; scanned 2-7 times over 2 years). Splines were used to 
model nonlinear trajectories of grey matter volume development in 53 cortical
areas and 16 subcortical nuclei. Generally, volumes increased before puberty,
peaked, and declined into adulthood. We identified 3 milestones of grey matter
development: I) age at peak volume; II) age at onset of volume decline; and III) 
age at maximum rate of volume decline. These milestones differentiated growth
trajectories of primary sensory/motor cortical areas from those of association
cortex but also revealed distinct trajectories between association cortices.
Cluster analysis of trajectories showed that prefrontal cortex was the most
heterogenous of association regions, comprising areas with distinct milestones
and developmental trajectories. These results highlight the potential of
high-field structural MRI to define the dynamics of primate brain development and
importantly to identify when specific prefrontal circuits may be most vulnerable 
to environmental impact.

Background: Parkinson's disease (PD) patients frequently present gastrointestinal
(GI) dysfunction that, in many cases, predates the onset of motor symptoms. In
PD, the presynaptic protein alpha-synuclein (α-syn) undergoes pathological
changes, including phosphorylation and aggregation leading to the formation of
Lewy bodies, which can be found in neurons of the enteric nervous system (ENS).
Inflammation has been proposed as a possible trigger of α-syn pathology.
Interestingly, patients with inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel
syndrome, conditions associated with GI inflammation, are at higher risk of
developing PD. Captive common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) develop colitis,
providing a natural platform to assess the relationship between α-syn pathology
and GI inflammation. Materials and Methods: Sections of proximal colon from
marmosets with colitis (n=5; 5.3±2.3 years old; 4 male) and normal controls (n=5;
4.1±1.6 years old; 1 male) were immunostained against protein gene product 9.5
(PGP9.5), human leukocyte antigen DR (HLA-DR), cluster of differentiation 3
(CD3), cluster of differentiation 20 (CD20), glial fibrillary acidic protein
(GFAP), 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), α-syn, and serine 129
phosphorylated α-syn (p-α-syn). Immunoreactivity of each staining in the
myenteric plexus was quantified using NIH ImageJ software. Results: Marmosets
with colitis had significantly increased expression of inflammatory markers
(HLA-DR, p<0.02; CD3, p<0.008), oxidative stress (8-OHdG, p<0.05), and p-α-syn
(p<0.02) and decreased expression of α-syn (p<0.04) in the colonic myenteric
ganglia compared to normal, healthy controls. Conclusion: Colonic inflammation is
associated with changes in α-syn expression and phosphorylation in the myenteric 
plexus of common marmosets. Future evaluation of the vagus nerve and brain of
animals with colitis will be key to assess the contribution of colitis-induced
ENS α-syn pathology to PD-like pathology in the brain.

Staphylococcal enterotoxins (SEs) produced by Staphylococcus aureus are known as 
causative agents of emetic food poisoning. We previously demonstrated that SEA
binds with submucosal mast cells and evokes mast cell degranulation in a small
emetic house musk shrew model. Notably, primates have been recognized as the
standard model for emetic assays and analysis of SE emetic activity. However, the
mechanism involved in SEA-induced vomiting in primates has not yet been
elucidated. In the present study, we established common marmosets as an emetic
animal model. Common marmosets were administered classical SEs, including SEA,
SEB and SEC, and exhibited multiple vomiting responses. However, a non-emetic
staphylococcal superantigen, toxic shock syndrome toxin-1, did not induce emesis 
in these monkeys. These results indicated that the common marmoset is a useful
animal model for assessing the emesis-inducing activity of SEs. Furthermore,
histological analysis uncovered that SEA bound with submucosal mast cells and
induced mast cell degranulation. Additionally, ex vivo and in vivo
pharmacological results showed that SEA-induced histamine release plays a
critical role in the vomiting response in common marmosets. The present results
suggested that 5-hydroxytryptamine also plays an important role in the
transmission of emetic stimulation on the afferent vagus nerve or central nervous
system. We conclude that SEA induces histamine release from submucosal mast cells
in the gastrointestinal tract and that histamine contributes to the SEA-induced
vomiting reflex via the serotonergic nerve and/or other vagus nerve.

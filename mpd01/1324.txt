l-DOPA is the gold standard for treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). However,
the drug produces some serious side effects, including dyskinesia, which is
characterized by repetitive involuntary movements-including chorea. In the
present preclinical study using a nonhuman primate model, dyskinesia caused by
repeated l-DOPA administration was investigated in the context of behavioral
sensitization by objectively quantifying motor activity in the common marmoset of
PD model (the Parkinsonian marmoset). Twelve male Parkinsonian marmosets
previously treated with MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) and
six intact male marmosets were used. The motor activity of each marmoset was
measured using infrared sensors attached to each individual living cage.
Parkinsonian marmosets (n=6) exhibited behavioral sensitization (enhanced motor
activity) in 10weeks upon oral administration of l-DOPA (10mg/kg per day on
3days/week). These animals also exhibited dyskinesia characterized by repetitive 
rapid movements including chorea in 6-10weeks. Neither behavioral sensitization
nor dyskinesia was observed in Parkinsonian marmosets given vehicle and in intact
marmosets given l-DOPA at the same dose (both n=6 each). Behavioral sensitization
was detected sensitively and objectively on motor activity only in Parkinsonian
marmosets given repeated l-DOPA at a similar dose used in PD patients. The
behavioral feature of the marmosets was dyskinesia similar to that of PD patients
but appeared earlier than would be manifested in humans. In spite of
statistically significant behavioral sensitization, some marmosets did not
exhibit dyskinesia in the present limited l-DOPA administration period. Although 
both commonalities and differences may exist between behavioral sensitization and
dyskinesia, behavioral sensitization is considered to be an objective,
quantitative, sensitive and predictive measure of behavioral mechanism underlying
dyskinesia in preclinical studies in evaluating compounds.

Although deep brain electrical stimulation can alleviate the motor symptoms of
Parkinson disease (PD), just a small fraction of patients with PD can take
advantage of this procedure due to its invasive nature. A significantly less
invasive method--epidural spinal cord stimulation (SCS)--has been suggested as an
alternative approach for symptomatic treatment of PD. However, the mechanisms
underlying motor improvements through SCS are unknown. Here, we show that SCS
reproducibly alleviates motor deficits in a primate model of PD. Simultaneous
neuronal recordings from multiple structures of the cortico-basal
ganglia-thalamic loop in parkinsonian monkeys revealed abnormal highly
synchronized neuronal activity within each of these structures and excessive
functional coupling among them. SCS disrupted this pathological circuit behavior 
in a manner that mimics the effects caused by pharmacological dopamine
replacement therapy or deep brain stimulation. These results suggest that SCS
should be considered as an additional treatment option for patients with PD.

Infiltration of leukocytes is a major pathological event in white matter lesion
formation in the brain of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. In grey matter
lesions, less infiltration of these cells occur, but microglial activation is
present. Thus far, the interaction of β-integrins with extracellular matrix
proteins, e.g. fibronectin, is considered to be of importance for the influx of
immune cells. Recent in vitro studies indicate a possible role for the enzyme
tissue Transglutaminase (TG2) in mediating cell adhesion and migration. In the
present study we questioned whether TG2 is present in white and grey matter
lesions observed in the marmoset model for MS. To this end, immunohistochemical
studies were performed. We observed that TG2, expressed by infiltrating monocytes
in white matter lesions co-expressed β1-integrin and is located in close
apposition to deposited fibronectin. These data suggest an important role for TG2
in the adhesion and migration of infiltrating monocytes during white matter
lesion formation. Moreover, in grey matter lesions, TG2 is mainly present in
microglial cells together with some β1-integrin, whereas fibronectin is absent in
these lesions. These data imply an alternative role for microglial-derived TG2 in
grey matter lesions, e.g. cell proliferation. Further research should clarify the
functional role of TG2 in monocytes or microglial cells in MS lesion formation.

Visual perception requires integrating signals arriving at different times from
parallel visual streams. For example, signals carried on the phasic-magnocellular
(MC) pathway reach the cerebral cortex pathways some tens of milliseconds before 
signals traveling on the tonic-parvocellular (PC) pathway. Visual latencies of
cells in the koniocellular (KC) pathway have not been specifically studied in
simian primates. Here we compared MC and PC cells to "blue-on" (BON) and
"blue-off" (BOF) KC cells; these cells carry visual signals originating in
short-wavelength-sensitive (S) cones. We made extracellular recordings in the
lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of anesthetized marmosets. We found that BON
visual latencies are 10-20 ms longer than those of PC or MC cells. A small number
of recorded BOF cells (n = 7) had latencies 10-20 ms longer than those of BON
cells. Within all cell groups, latencies of foveal receptive fields (<10°
eccentricity) were longer (by 3-8 ms) than latencies of peripheral receptive
fields (>10°). Latencies of yellow-off inputs to BON cells lagged the blue-on
inputs by up to 30 ms, but no differences in visual latency were seen on
comparing marmosets expressing dichromatic ("red-green color-blind") or
trichromatic color vision phenotype. We conclude that S-cone signals leaving the 
LGN on KC pathways are delayed with respect to signals traveling on PC and MC
pathways. Cortical circuits serving color vision must therefore integrate across 
delays in (red-green) chromatic signals carried by PC cells and (blue-yellow)
signals carried by KC cells.

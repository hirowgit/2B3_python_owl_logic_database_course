In the Brazilian Amazon region, malaria caused by Plasmodium malariae is
considered to be a zoonosis because of cross-transfer of the parasite between
humans and Neotropical primates. To contribute information on this issue, we
investigated occurrences of natural infection with Plasmodium sp. among
Neotropical primates in the Maranhense Amazon (Amazon region of the state of
Maranhão), in the northeastern region of Brazil. Blood samples were collected
from 161 Neotropical primates of six species that were caught in an environmental
reserve (Sítio Aguahy) and from captive primates (CETAS-Wildlife Screening
Center, municipality of São Luís), in Maranhão. Plasmodium sp. was diagnosed
based on light microscopy, PCR, qPCR and LAMP for amplification of the 18S rRNA
gene. Serum samples were also assayed by means of indirect immunofluorescence for
IgG antibodies against P. malariae/P. brasilianum, P. falciparum and P. berghei. 
Parasites were detected through light microscopy on five slides from captive
primates (four Sapajus spp. and one Callithrix jacchus). In the molecular tests, 
34.16% (55/161) and 29.81% (48/161) of the animals sampled were positive in the
qPCR and PCR assays, respectively. In the PCR, 47/48 animals were positive for P.
malariae/P. brasilianum; of these, eight were free-living primates and 39 from
CETAS, São Luís. One sample showed a band in the genus-specific reaction, but not
in the second PCR reaction. Anti-P. malariae/P. brasilianum IgG antibodies were
detected in four serum samples from Sapajus spp. in captivity. In this study,
circulation of P. malariae/P. brasilianum in Neotropical primates was confirmed, 
with low levels of parasitemia and low levels of antibodies. The importance of
these animals as reservoirs of human malaria in the region studied is still
unknown. This scenario has an impact on control and elimination of malaria in
this region.

KEY POINTS: The cortical mechanisms of grasping have been extensively studied in 
macaques and humans; here, we investigated whether common marmosets could rely on
similar mechanisms despite strong differences in hand morphology and grip
diversity. We recorded electrocorticographic activity over the sensorimotor
cortex of two common marmosets during the execution of different grip types,
which allowed us to study cortical activity (power spectrum) and physiologically 
inferred connectivity (phase-slope index). Analyses were performed in beta
(16-35 Hz) and gamma (75-100 Hz) frequency bands and our results showed that beta
power varied depending on grip type, whereas gamma power displayed clear
epoch-related modulation. Strength and direction of inter-area connectivity
varied depending on grip type and epoch. These findings suggest that fundamental 
control mechanisms are conserved across primates and, in future research,
marmosets could represent an adequate model to investigate primate brain
mechanisms.
ABSTRACT: The cortical mechanisms of grasping have been extensively studied in
macaques and humans. Here, we investigated whether common marmosets could rely on
similar mechanisms despite striking differences in manual dexterity. Two common
marmosets were trained to grasp-and-pull three objects eliciting different hand
configurations: whole-hand, finger and scissor grips. The animals were then
chronically implanted with 64-channel electrocorticogram arrays positioned over
the left premotor, primary motor and somatosensory cortex. Power spectra,
reflecting predominantly cortical activity, and phase-slope index, reflecting the
direction of information flux, were studied in beta (16-35 Hz) and gamma
(75-100 Hz) bands. Differences related to grip type, epoch (reach, grasp) and
cortical area were statistically assessed. Results showed that whole-hand and
scissor grips triggered stronger beta desynchronization than finger grip. Task
epochs clearly modulated gamma power, especially for finger and scissor grips.
Considering effective connectivity, finger and scissor grips evoked stronger
outflow from primary motor to premotor cortex, whereas whole-hand grip displayed 
the opposite pattern. These findings suggest that fundamental control mechanisms,
relying on adjustments of cortical activity and connectivity, are conserved
across primates. Consistently, marmosets could represent a good model to
investigate primate brain mechanisms.

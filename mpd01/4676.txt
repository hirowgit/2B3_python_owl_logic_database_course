Spontaneous neoplasms of the marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). Oral and
nasopharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas.

Betton GR.

Eight spontaneous highly invasive oral and nasopharyngeal squamous cell
carcinomas were observed over an 18-month period in a breeding colony of the
common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). Affected marmosets were predominantly males
over four years of age. The incidence of this tumor in the four-year-plus age
group was 4.9%. The tumors were locally invasive through the palate to the nasal 
cavity, retrobulbar space and cranial cavity in some marmosets with lung
metastases present in three cases.

Primary structures of adult hemoglobins of silvery marmoset, Callithrix
argentatus, and cotton-headed tamarin, Saguinus oedipus.

Maita T, Hayashida M, Matsuda G.

Tryptic peptides of the alpha and beta chains from silvery marmoset (Callithrix
argentatus) and cotton-headed tamarin (Saguinus oedipus) hemoglobins were
isolated and sequenced, respectively, by conventional methods. The ordering of
the peptides in each chain was deduced from the homology of their sequences with 
those of human adult hemoglobin. The primary structures thus deduced are compared
with those of other primate hemoglobins, and the rate of evolution in New World
monkey hemoglobins is discussed.

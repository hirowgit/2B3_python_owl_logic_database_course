A safe means of anaesthetizing common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) for a study 
using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to investigate cerebral ischaemia was
required. Continuous infusion of alphaxalone/alphadalone was used to anaesthetize
37 marmosets for non-recovery and recovery experiments. This was found to give
safe, reliable anaesthesia when coupled with pulse oximetry and
electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring.

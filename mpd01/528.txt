Marmosets are small New World primates that are posited to become an important
preclinical animal model for studying intractable human brain diseases. A
critical step in the development of marmosets as a viable model for human brain
dysfunction is to characterize brain networks that are homologous with human
network topologies. In this regard, the use of functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) holds tremendous potential for functional brain mapping in
marmosets. Although possible, implementation of hardware for fMRI in awake
marmosets (free of the confounding effects of anesthesia) is not trivial due to
the technical challenges associated with developing specialized imaging hardware.
Here, we describe the design and implementation of a marmoset holder and
head-fixation system with an integrated receive coil for awake marmoset fMRI.
This design minimized head motion, with less than 100  μm of translation and 0.5 
degrees of rotation over 15 consecutive resting state fMRI runs (at 15 min each) 
across 3 different marmosets. The fMRI data was of sufficient quality to reliably
extract 8 resting state networks from each animal with only 60-90 min of resting 
state fMRI acquisition per animal. The restraint system proved to be an efficient
and practical solution for securing an awake marmoset and positioning a receive
array within minutes, limiting stress to the animal. This design is also amenable
for multimodal imaging, allowing for electrode or lens placement above the skull 
via the open chamber design. All computer-aided-design (CAD) files and
engineering drawings are provided as an open resource, with the majority of the
parts designed to be 3D printed.

Fabry disease is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by the deficiency of
α-galactosidase A. Enzyme deficiency results in a progressive decline in renal
and cardiac function, leading to cardiomyopathy and end-stage renal disease.
Current treatments available, including enzyme replacement therapies, have
provided significant benefit to patients; however, unmet medical needs remain.
mRNA therapy, with drug-like properties, has the unique ability to produce
therapeutic proteins endogenously. Here we describe the sustained delivery of
therapeutic human α-galactosidase protein in vivo via nanoparticle-formulated
mRNA in mouse and non-human primate, with a demonstration of efficacy through
clinically relevant biomarker reduction in a mouse Fabry disease model.
Multi-component nanoparticles formulated with lipids and lipid-like materials
were developed for the delivery of mRNA encoding human α-galactosidase protein.
Upon delivery of human GLA mRNA to mice, serum GLA protein levels reached as high
as ∼1,330-fold over normal physiological values.

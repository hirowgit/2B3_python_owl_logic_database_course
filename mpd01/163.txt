Alginate as a versatile naturally occurring biomaterial has found widespread use 
in the biomedical field due to its unique features such as biocompatibility and
biodegradability. The ability of its semipermeable hydrogels to provide a
favourable microenvironment for clinically relevant cells made alginate
encapsulation a leading technology for immunoisolation, 3D culture,
cryopreservation as well as cell and drug delivery. The aim of this work is the
evaluation of structural properties and swelling behaviour of the core-shell
capsules for the encapsulation of multipotent stromal cells (MSCs), their 3D
culture and cryopreservation using slow freezing. The cells were encapsulated in 
core-shell capsules using coaxial electrospraying, cultured for 35 days and
cryopreserved. Cell viability, metabolic activity and cell-cell interactions were
analysed. Cryopreservation of MSCs-laden core-shell capsules was performed
according to parameters pre-selected on cell-free capsules. The results suggest
that core-shell capsules produced from the low viscosity high-G alginate are
superior to high-M ones in terms of stability during in vitro culture, as well as
to solid beads in terms of promoting formation of viable self-assembled cellular 
structures and maintenance of MSCs functionality on a long-term basis. The
application of 0.3 M sucrose demonstrated a beneficial effect on the integrity of
capsules and viability of formed 3D cell assemblies, as compared to 10% dimethyl 
sulfoxide (DMSO) alone. The proposed workflow from the preparation of core-shell 
capsules with self-assembled cellular structures to the cryopreservation appears 
to be a promising strategy for their off-the-shelf availability.

POU class 5 homeobox 1 (POU5F1, also known as OCT4) is critical for maintenance
of pluripotency, germ cell fate, reprogramming into a pluripotent state, and
early embryogenesis. We generated an embryonic stem cell (ESC) line of the common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) harboring a heterozygous knock-in allele of
OCT4-P2A-mCerulean-T2A-pac. The ESC line (CMES40-OC) will be valuable for
investigation of primed/naïve pluripotency and germ cell fate. Homozygous OCT4
knock-in clones were generated but could not be sustained in an undifferentiated 
state in long-term culture. The OCT4 knock-in system facilitated simultaneous
knock-in of a reporter construct at another locus, DDX4 (VASA).

Ciliated cells of the respiratory epithelium play an essential role in the
mechanisms of mucociliary clearance, and ultrastructural alterations of cilia are
known to be associated with respiratory disease. The aim of this study was to
evaluate the presence of ciliary changes in common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus)
of different age groups and to compare healthy animals with animals suffering
from subclinical chronic inflammatory pulmonary lesions. Therefore, samples of
different sites of the tracheobronchial tree from 24 common marmosets were
investigated by transmission electron microscopy. Ciliary alterations were
present in all animals and were represented by compound cilia ("bulging/adhesive 
type"), extramatrix, extratubuli, and disorientation of the microtubular
arrangement. Ciliary alterations affected less than 1% of cilia (average
0.06%-0.55%) with no statistically significant differences between age groups,
sample localizations, or healthy and sick animals. The study results suggest that
ciliary alterations of secondary nature are a common background finding in common
marmosets with individual variability in abundance and have to be considered when
interpreting ultrastructural data from respiratory studies.

OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to design an adaptive neuroprosthetic controller that
could learn the mapping from neural states to prosthetic actions and
automatically adjust adaptation using only a binary evaluative feedback as a
measure of desirability/undesirability of performance.
APPROACH: Hebbian reinforcement learning (HRL) in a connectionist network was
used for the design of the adaptive controller. The method combines the
efficiency of supervised learning with the generality of reinforcement learning. 
The convergence properties of this approach were studied using both closed-loop
control simulations and open-loop simulations that used primate neural data from 
robot-assisted reaching tasks.
MAIN RESULTS: The HRL controller was able to perform classification and
regression tasks using its episodic and sequential learning modes, respectively. 
In our experiments, the HRL controller quickly achieved convergence to an
effective control policy, followed by robust performance. The controller also
automatically stopped adapting the parameters after converging to a satisfactory 
control policy. Additionally, when the input neural vector was reorganized, the
controller resumed adaptation to maintain performance.
SIGNIFICANCE: By estimating an evaluative feedback directly from the user, the
HRL control algorithm may provide an efficient method for autonomous adaptation
of neuroprosthetic systems. This method may enable the user to teach the
controller the desired behavior using only a simple feedback signal.

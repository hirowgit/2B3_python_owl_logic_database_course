Numerous studies have shown that the visual system consists of functionally
distinct ventral and dorsal streams; however, its exact spatial-temporal dynamics
during natural visual behavior remain to be investigated. Here, we report
cerebral neural dynamics during active visual exploration recorded by an
electrocorticographic array covering the entire lateral surface of the marmoset
cortex. We found that the dorsal stream was activated before the primary visual
cortex with saccades and followed by the alteration of suppression and activation
signals along the ventral stream. Similarly, the signal that propagated from the 
dorsal to ventral visual areas was accompanied by a travelling wave of low
frequency oscillations. Such signal dynamics occurred at an average of 220 ms
after saccades, which corresponded to the timing when whole-brain activation
returned to background levels. We also demonstrated that saccades could occur at 
any point of signal flow, indicating the parallel computation of motor commands. 
Overall, this study reveals the neural dynamics of active vision, which are
efficiently linked to the natural rhythms of visual exploration.

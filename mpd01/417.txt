Common marmosets have attracted considerable attention as a small standard
primate model in biomedical research. However, no marmoset diabetes model is
available. Here, we established a marmoset diabetes model via the combination of 
partial pancreatectomy and intravenous streptozotocin (STZ). A partial
pancreatectomy was performed in 11 common marmosets and multiple STZ doses were
intravenously administered. Diabetes was diagnosed upon sustained hyperglycaemia 
(nonfasting blood glucose level >200â€‰mg/dl). Blood glucose and biochemistry were 
periodically assessed, in addition to glucose tolerance testing, continual blood 
glucose determination using a continuous glucose monitoring system, urine testing
and histological evaluation. In 8 of the 11 animals (73%), diabetes mellitus was 
induced. The diabetic marmosets also showed abnormal intravenous and oral glucose
tolerance test results. Blood glucose levels decreased in response to human
insulin administration. The hyperglycaemic state was irreversible and persisted
for more than 3 months, and the animals' condition was manageable via daily
insulin administration. Thus, diabetes can be successfully induced and maintained
in the common marmoset via partial pancreatectomy and STZ administration. This
protocol effectively generates a valuable animal model for studying disease
pathogenesis, risk factors and therapeutic interventions, including islet
transplantation.

South American Zika virus (ZIKV) recently emerged as a novel human pathogen,
linked with neurological disorders. However, comparative ZIKV infectivity studies
in New World primates are lacking. Two members of the Callitrichidae family,
common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) and red-bellied tamarins (Saguinus
labiatus), were highly susceptible to sub-cutaneous challenge with the Puerto
Rico-origin ZIKVPRVABC59 strain. Both exhibited rapid, high, acute viraemia with 
early neuroinvasion (3 days) in peripheral and central nervous tissue. ZIKV RNA
levels in blood and tissues were significantly higher in New World hosts compared
to Old World species (Macaca mulatta, Macaca fascicularis). Tamarins and rhesus
macaques exhibited loss of zonal occludens-1 (ZO-1) staining, indicative of a
compromised blood-brain barrier 3 days post-ZIKV exposure. Early, widespread
dissemination across multiple anatomical sites distant to the inoculation site
preceded extensive ZIKV persistence after 100 days in New and Old World lineages,
especially lymphoid, neurological and reproductive sites. Prolonged persistence
in brain tissue has implications for otherwise resolved human ZIKV infection.
High susceptibility of distinct New World species underscores possible
establishment of ZIKV sylvatic cycles in primates indigenous to ZIKV endemic
regions. Tamarins and marmosets represent viable New World models for ZIKV
pathogenesis and therapeutic intervention studies, including vaccines, with
contemporary strains.

Neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) are distinguished by the
neurotransmitter types they release, their synaptic connections, morphology, and 
genetic profiles. To fully understand how the CNS works, it is critical to
identify all neuronal classes and reveal their synaptic connections. The retina
has been extensively used to study neuronal development and circuit formation.
Here, we describe a previously unidentified interneuron in mammalian retina. This
interneuron shares some morphological, physiological, and molecular features with
retinal bipolar cells, such as receiving input from photoreceptors and relaying
visual signals to retinal ganglion cells. It also shares some features with
amacrine cells (ACs), particularly Aii-ACs, such as their neurite morphology in
the inner plexiform layer, the expression of some AC-specific markers, and
possibly the release of the inhibitory neurotransmitter glycine. Thus, we unveil 
an uncommon interneuron, which may play an atypical role in vision.

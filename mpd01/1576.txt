Among primates, the common marmoset is suitable for primate embryology research. 
Its small body size, however, has delayed the technical development of efficient 
embryo transfer. Furthermore, three factors have been determined to adversely
affect the performance of marmoset embryo transfer: nonsurgical approaches, the
use of cryopreserved embryos, and the use of late-stage embryos. Here we
performed embryo transfer under conditions that included the above three factors 
and using either a small (1 μl or less) or a large volume (2-3 μl) of medium. The
pregnancy and birth rates were 50% (5/10) and 27% (3/11), respectively, when
using the large volume, and 80% (8/10) and 75% (9/12), respectively, when using
the small volume. The latter scores exceed those of previous reports using
comparable conditions. Thus, it appears that these three previously considered
factors could be overcome, and we propose that reducing the transfer volume to 1 
μl or less is essential for successful marmoset embryo transfer.

MRI at high field can be sensitized to the magnetic properties of tissues, which 
introduces a signal dependence on the orientation of white matter (WM) fiber
bundles relative to the magnetic field. In addition, study of the NMR relaxation 
properties of this signal has indicated contributions from compartmentalized
water environments inside and outside the myelin sheath that may be separable.
Here we further investigated the effects of water compartmentalization on the MRI
signal with the goal of extracting compartment-specific information. By comparing
MRI measurements of human and marmoset brain at 7T with magnetic field modeling, 
we show that: (1) water between the myelin lipid bilayers, in the axonal, and in 
the interstitial space each experience characteristic magnetic field effects that
depend on fiber orientation (2) these field effects result in characteristic
relaxation properties and frequency shifts for these compartments; and (3)
compartmental contributions may be separated by multi-component fitting of the
MRI signal relaxation (i.e. decay) curve. We further show the potential
application of these findings to the direct mapping of myelin content and
assessment of WM fiber integrity with high field MRI.

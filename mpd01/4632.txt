Haematological characteristics of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus
jacchus).

McIntosh GH, Lawson CA, Rodgers SE, Lloyd JV.

Blood cell indices and parameters of haemostasis were studied in the common
marmoset. The majority of the results were similar to those found in man.
Differences from man were that the prothrombin time was shorter in the marmoset, 
higher concentrations of aggregating stimuli were required to cause platelet
aggregation, and marmoset platelets did not aggregate under the influence of
adrenalin. There was sexual dimorphism evident in the data for fibrinogen
concentration and for platelet count, both of which were higher in females than
in males. Marmoset platelets were very similar in ultrastructure to those of man.

Plasma aminotransferase measurements in the marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).

Cowie JR, Evans GO.

Plasma aminotransferase values were measured in a large number of samples from
male and female marmosets. There were no differences due to age or sex for either
AST or ALT. Haemolysis affected values for both enzymes, though the effect on ALT
was greater.

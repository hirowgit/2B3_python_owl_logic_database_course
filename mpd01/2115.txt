Here, we present a new primate phylogeny inferred from molecular supermatrix
analyses of size 42 kb containing 70% of missing data, and representing 75% of
primate species diversity. The supermatrix was analysed using a gene-partitioned 
maximum likelihood approach to obtain an exhaustive molecular phylogenetic
framework. All clades recovered from recent molecular works were upheld in our
analyses demonstrating that the presence of missing data did not bias our
supermatrix inference. The resulting phylogenetic tree was subsequently dated
with a molecular dating method to provide a timescale for speciation events.
Results obtained from our relaxed molecular clock analyses concurred with
previous works based on the same fossil constraints. The resulting dated tree
allowed to infer of macroevolutionary processes among the primates. Shifts in
diversification rate and speciation rates were determined using the SymmeTREE
method and a birthdeath process. No significant asymmetry was detected for the
primate clade, but significant shifts in diversification rate were identified for
seven clades: Anthropoidea, Lemuriformes, Lemuridae, Galagidae, Callithrix genus,
the Cercopithecinae and Asian Macaca. Comparisons with previous primate supertree
results reveal that (i) there was a diversification event at the root of the
Lemuriformes, (ii) a higher diversification rate is detected for Cercopithecidae 
and Anthropoidea and (iii) a shift in diversification is always recovered for
Macaca genus. Macroevolutionary inferences and primate divergence dates show that
major primate diversification events occurred after the Paleogene, suggesting the
extinction of ancient primate lineages.

Recently, we reported our web-accessible digital brain atlas of the common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) at http://marmoset-brain.org:2008. Using digital
images obtained during construction of this website, we developed stand-alone
software for navigation of electrodes or injection needles for stereotaxic
electrophysiological or anatomical experiments in vivo. This software enables us 
to draw lines on exchangeable section images, measure the length and angle of
lines, superimpose a stereotaxic reference grid on the image, and send the image 
to the system clipboard. The software, Stereo Navi 2.0, is freely available at
our brain atlas website.

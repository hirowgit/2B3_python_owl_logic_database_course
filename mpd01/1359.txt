Here we investigated the transduction characteristics of adeno-associated viral
vector (AAV) serotypes 1, 2, 5, 8 and 9 in the marmoset cerebral cortex. Using
three constructs that each has hrGFP under ubiquitous (CMV), or neuron-specific
(CaMKII and Synapsin I (SynI)) promoters, we investigated (1) the extent of viral
spread, (2) cell type tropism, and (3) neuronal transduction efficiency of each
serotype. AAV2 was clearly distinct from other serotypes in small spreading and
neuronal tropism. We did not observe significant differences in viral spread
among other serotypes. Regarding the cell tropism, AAV1, 5, 8 and 9 exhibited
mostly glial expression for CMV construct. However, when the CaMKII construct was
tested, cortical neurons were efficiently transduced (>∼70% in layer 3) by all
serotypes, suggesting that glial expression obscured neuronal expression for CMV 
construct. For both SynI and CaMKII constructs, we observed generally high-level 
expression in large pyramidal cells especially in layer 5, as well as in
parvalbumin-positive interneurons. The expression from the CaMKII construct was
more uniformly observed in excitatory cells compared with SynI construct.
Injection of the same viral preparations in mouse and macaque cortex resulted in 
essentially the same result with some species-specific differences.

Primordial germ cells (PGCs) are the embryonic progenitors of sperm and egg
cells. Mammalian PGCs are thought to actively migrate from the yolk sac endoderm 
over long distances across the embryo to reach the somatic genital ridges. The
general principles of mammalian PGC development were discovered in mice. In
contrast, little is known about PGC development in primates due to extremely
limited access to primate embryos. Here, we analyzed 12 well preserved marmoset
monkey (Callithrix jacchus) embryos covering the phase from PGC emergence in the 
endoderm to the formation of the sexually differentiated gonad (embryonic day (E)
50 to E95). We show using immunohistochemistry that the pluripotency factors
OCT4A and NANOG specifically mark PGCs throughout the period studied. In
contrast, SALL4 and LIN28 were first expressed ubiquitously and only later
down-regulated in somatic tissues. We further show, for the first time, that PGCs
are located in the endoderm in E50 embryos in close spatial proximity to the
prospective genital ridge, making a long-range migration of PGCs dispensable. At 
E65, PGCs are already present in the primitive gonad, while significantly later
embryonic stages still exhibit PGCs at their original endodermal site, revealing 
a wide spatio-temporal window of PGC distribution. Our findings challenge the
'dogma' of active long-range PGC migration from the endoderm to the gonads. We
therefore favor an alternative model based primarily on passive translocation of 
PGCs from the mesenchyme that surrounds the gut to the prospective gonad through 
the intercalar expansion of mesenchymal tissue which contains the PGCs. In
summary, we (i) show differential pluripotency factor expression during primate
embryo development and (ii) provide a schematic model for embryonic PGC
translocation.

Scratching has been widely used as an indicator of anxiety in many primate
species. However, a handful of studies have shown no change in scratching under
anxiety-provoking circumstances. In addition, the existing literature has
investigated scratching only in relation to negative arousal (i.e., anxiety),
even though anxiety and excitement (positive arousal) share important
physiological and behavioral correlates, including increased heart rate, blood
pressure, and locomotion. In the current study, we scored all instances of
scratching in 11 outdoor-housed captive common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus)
during three contexts that were intended to be negatively arousing and three
contexts that were intended to be positively arousing during a baseline,
manipulation, and post-induction period. Summed across the three negative arousal
contexts, the results showed that subjects exhibited significantly lower
scratching rates during the manipulation than during either the baseline or
post-induction periods, and the pattern of means was the same for all three of
those contexts. Under the three contexts of positive arousal, subjects exhibited 
different patterns of scratching rates during the manipulation periods
(play = increases, foraging = decreases, food anticipation = no change). Data
from the current study, and a close examination of data from studies showing no
change in scratching under anxiety-provoking circumstances, suggest that the
anxiety-scratching relationship may be more complex than has been reported
previously. Our results raise a potential concern about the unchallenged use of
scratching as a behavioral indicator of anxiety in captive non-human primates,
with important implications for welfare and management of these species.

Spermatogonia are specialized cells responsible for continuous spermatogenesis
and the production of offspring. Because of this biological property, in vitro
culture of spermatogonia provides a powerful methodology to advance reproductive 
biology and engineering. However, methods for culturing primate spermatogonia are
poorly established. We have designed a novel method for culturing spermatogonia
in the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a small primate. By using our method
with a suite of growth factors, adult marmoset testis-derived germ cells could be
cultured in the form of a floating sphere for several weeks. Notably, this method
could be applied not only to freshly isolated cells but also to cryopreserved
cell stocks. The spheres enriched spermatogonia and early spermatocytes, and
could be assembled from a C-KIT(+) spermatogonial population. Techniques for
culturing spermatogonia could facilitate increased understanding of primate
reproduction as well as the preservation of valuable biomaterials from nonhuman
primates.

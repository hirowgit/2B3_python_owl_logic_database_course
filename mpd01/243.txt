BACKGROUND: The capuchin is a neotropical primate that presents easy reproduction
in captivity and is used in scientific research. The objective of this work was
to describe the structure and the branching pattern of the brachial plexus of the
capuchin and to compare the results with data from the literature for humans,
chimpanzees, baboons and Callithrix.
METHODS: Twelve specimens were used: eight males and four females. No animals
were killed for the purpose of this study.
RESULTS: The brachial plexus of Sapajus sp was constituted mainly from the
ventral roots of the last four cervical spinal nerves, from C5 to C8, mainly, and
the first thoracic nerve (T1).
CONCLUSIONS: The pattern of formation of the brachial plexus of the capuchin
monkey was more similar to that of Callithrix and baboons, perhaps because they
are the only primates in this study to be essentially quadrupedal.

BACKGROUND: Callithrix jacchus, it is a species highly targeted by wild animal
traffickers and, when apprehended, they need veterinary care. For safe
therapeutic procedures, knowledge of anatomy is essential, as well as for
diagnostic by imaging, good radiographic positioning is essential.
METHODS: The anatomy of the paranasal sinuses and the radiographic projections
was described using 10 carcasses of common marmosets. Radiographs were taken in
two panoramic views of their head: profile and frontal-naso. For the anatomical
study, paramedian and transverse macroscopic sections and microscopic transverse 
sections were performed.
RESULTS: On the radiographs, it was possible to identify the frontal recess and
maxillary sinuses in profile and frontal-naso incidences. In the anatomical
study, the frontal recess and maxillary, sphenoid and ethmoid paranasal sinuses
were identified.
CONCLUSIONS: The ethmoidal sinus could be observed only microscopically and the
sphenoidal sinus difficult to see on the radiography due to the overlapping
adjoining structures.

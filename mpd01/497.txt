As a primate animal model for neuroscience research, the common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus) provides an unprecedented opportunity to gain a better
understanding of the human brain function and pathophysiology of neurological and
psychiatric disorders, thereby helping in the diagnosis and treatment of those
disorders. The marmoset is particularly useful in studying the neural mechanisms 
underlying social behavior, as their prosocial behavior and visual and vocal
communication systems are well-developed. Despite recent advances in
biotechnology such as the creation of genetically engineered marmosets, our
understanding of the marmoset brain, including its dysfunction in disease, at the
circuit level remains limited due to the lack of comprehensive knowledge of the
neuronal connections in the marmoset brain. Here we describe the development of
genetic and viral engineering techniques for a particular type of neuron in
non-transgenic animals. These approaches, combined with rabies viral tracing,
imaging, and electrophysiology, will make it possible to map the connectome and
relate neuronal connectivity to function in the marmoset brain. Such
circuit-level studies will open a new avenue for non-human primate research that 
can bridge the gap between basic research and human studies.

The genetic and biological similarity between non-human primates and humans has
ensured the continued use of primates in biomedical research where other species 
cannot be used. Health-monitoring programmes for non-human primates provide an
approach to monitor and control both endemic and incoming agents that may cause
zoonotic and anthroponotic disease or interfere with research outcomes. In 1999
FELASA recommendations were published which aimed to provide a harmonized
approach to health monitoring programmes for non-human primates. Scientific and
technological progress, understanding of non-human primates and evolving
microbiology has necessitated a review and replacement of the current
recommendations. These new recommendations are aimed at users and breeders of the
commonly used non-human primates; Macaca mulatta (Rhesus macaque) and Macaca
fascicularis (Cynomolgus macaque). In addition, other species including
Callithrix jacchus (Common marmoset) Saimiri sciureus (Squirrel monkey) and
others are included. The important and challenging aspects of non-human primate
health-monitoring programmes are discussed, including management protocols to
maintain and improve health status, health screening strategies and procedures,
health reporting and certification. In addition, information is provided on
specific micro-organisms and the recommended frequency of testing.

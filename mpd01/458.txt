Clostridium difficile is a well-documented cause of enterocolitis in several
species, including humans, with limited documentation in New World nonhuman
primates. We report several cases of C. difficile-associated pseudomembranous
enterocolitis, including a case in a Geoffroy's spider monkey (Ateles geoffroyi) 
and several cases in common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus). The histologic
lesions included a spectrum of severity, with most cases characterized by the
classic "volcano" lesions described in humans and several other animal species.
C. difficile was isolated from the colon of the spider monkey, while the presence
of toxin A or toxin B or of the genes of toxin A or B by polymerase chain
reaction served as corroborative evidence in several affected marmosets. C.
difficile should be considered a cause of enterocolitis in these species.

Although the Atlantic Forest marmosets (Callithrix spp.) are among the best
studied Neotropical primates, the Amazonian marmosets (Callibella humilis,
Cebuella spp. and Mico spp.) are much less well-known. Even species diversity and
distributions are yet to be properly determined because field data and materials 
currently available in scientific collections do not allow comprehensive
taxonomic studies of Amazonian marmosets. From 2015 to 2018, we conducted 10
expeditions in key-areas within southern Amazonia where little or no information 
on marmosets was available. In one such region-the Tapajós-Jamanxim interfluve-we
recorded marmosets with a distinctive pelage pigmentation pattern suggesting they
could represent a new species. We tested this hypothesis using an integrative
taxonomic framework that included phylogenomic data (ddRAD sequences), pelage
pigmentation characters, and distribution records. We found that the marmosets of
the northern Tapajós-Jamanxim interfluve have unique states in pelage
pigmentation characters, form a clade (100% support) in our Bayesian and
Maximum-Likelihood phylogenies, and occur in an area isolated from other taxa by 
rivers. The integration of these lines of evidence leads us to describe a new
marmoset species in the genus Mico, named after the Munduruku Amerindians of the 
Tapajós-Jamanxim interfluve, southwest of Pará State, Brazil.

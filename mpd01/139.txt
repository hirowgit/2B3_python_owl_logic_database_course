Crithidia mellificae, a monoxenous trypanosomatid considered restricted to
insects, was recently reported to infect a bat. Herein, C. mellificae has been
demonstrated to have a wider range of vertebrate hosts and distribution in
Brazilian biomes than once thought. Parasites isolated from haemocultures were
characterized using V7V8 SSU rDNA and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase
genes. Coatis (Nasua nasua) in the Cerrado; marmosets (Callithrix sp.) and bats
(Carollia perspicillata, Myotis lavali, M. izecksohni, Artibeus lituratus) in the
Atlantic Forest; crab-eating foxes (Cerdocyon thous) and ocelot (Leopardus
pardalis) in the Pantanal biomes were infected by trypanosomatids that displayed 
choanomastigote forms in haemoculture in Giemsa-stained slide smears. Molecular
characterization and phylogenetic inference confirmed the infection of C.
mellificae in these animals. Moreover, slight differences in C. mellificae
sequences were observed. Crithidia mellificae growth curves were counted at 27°C,
36°C and 37°C, and the morphotypes were able to grow and survive for up to 16
days. Serological titers for C. mellificae were observed in nonhuman primates,
demonstrating that this parasite is able to induce a humoral immune response in
an infected mammal. These results showed that host specificity in trypanosomatids
is complex and far from understood.

Parkinson's disease (PD) psychosis afflicts over half of patients and poses a
significant burden on quality of life. The aetiology of PD psychosis is
multifactorial and likely arises from the complex interaction between dopamine
replacement therapy and disease state. The
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-lesioned common marmoset is a
validated model to predict the efficacy of therapeutic compounds for
treatment-related complications, including PD psychosis. In this model,
psychosis-like behaviours (PLBs) encompass stereotypies that are idiosyncratic in
nature and reproducible with each L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylanaline (L-DOPA)
administration. In the present study, we sought to expand upon the existing
repertoire of PLBs through the characterisation of novel stereotypical behaviours
that appear dependent on the environment. We then discuss our findings in the
context of clinical reports on stereotypical behaviours termed "punding" in
subjects with PD, which consists of stereotypical repetitive and senseless
behaviours. The poor understanding of the pathophysiology governing punding and
consequent lack of effective therapies stand to benefit from enhanced
characterisation of these stereotypical behaviours in a validated pre-clinical
model. We hope that further characterisation of PLBs in the MPTP-lesioned
marmoset will be helpful in the evaluation of interventions that seek to
alleviate PD psychosis symptoms.

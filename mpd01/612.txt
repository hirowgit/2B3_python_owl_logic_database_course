Using stereological analysis of NeuN-stained sections, we investigated neuronal
density and number of neurons per column throughout the marmoset cortex.
Estimates of mean neuronal density encompassed a greater than 3-fold range, from 
>150 000 neurons/mm3 in the primary visual cortex to ~50 000 neurons/mm3 in the
piriform complex. There was a trend for density to decrease from posterior to
anterior cortex, but also local gradients, which resulted in a complex pattern;
for example, in frontal, auditory, and somatosensory cortex neuronal density
tended to increase towards anterior areas. Anterior cingulate, motor, premotor,
insular, and ventral temporal areas were characterized by relatively low neuronal
densities. Analysis across the depth of the cortex revealed greater laminar
variation of neuronal density in occipital, parietal, and inferior temporal
areas, in comparison with other regions. Moreover, differences between areas were
more pronounced in the supragranular layers than in infragranular layers.
Calculations of the number of neurons per unit column revealed a pattern that was
distinct from that of neuronal density, including local peaks in the posterior
parietal, superior temporal, precuneate, frontopolar, and temporopolar regions.
These results suggest that neuronal distribution in adult cortex result from a
complex interaction of developmental/ evolutionary determinants and functional
requirements.

The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-related molecule, MR1,
presents vitamin B metabolites from bacteria and yeast to mucosal-associated
invariant T (MAIT) cells. Despite the evolutionary conservation of MR1, we do not
know whether different allele variants of MR1 exist within the nonhuman primate
(NHP) populations that are commonly used for biomedical research. In this study, 
we identified 21 distinct MR1 nucleotide sequences representing 32 different
alleles across five different NHP populations. The majority of the alleles
conferring amino acid changes (allele variants) were found in or near the alpha-1
domain of the mature MR1 protein. We expressed four of the most commonly observed
MR1 allele variants in 293T cells, and we found that each variant could present
bacterial metabolites on the cell surface. We successfully induced cytokine
production in macaque MAIT cells stimulated with 293T cells expressing the four
most common MR1 allele variants, demonstrating the usefulness of these cell lines
to study MAIT cell activity. Our data suggests that MR1 is not monomorphic, but
that there are multiple MR1 alleles in NHPs. The materials we describe here will 
be valuable for characterizing differences in MR1 antigen presentation and MAIT
cell function in NHPs.

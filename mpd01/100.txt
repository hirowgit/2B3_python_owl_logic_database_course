Lesions in the primary visual cortex (V1) cause extensive retrograde degeneration
in the lateral geniculate nucleus, but it remains unclear whether they also
trigger any neuronal loss in other subcortical visual centers. The inferior
(IPul) and lateral (LPul) pulvinar nuclei have been regarded as part of the
pathways that convey visual information to both V1 and extrastriate cortex. Here,
we apply stereological analysis techniques to NeuN-stained sections of marmoset
brain, in order to investigate whether the volume of these nuclei, and the number
of neurons they comprise, change following unilateral long-term V1 lesions. For
comparison, the medial pulvinar nucleus (MPul), which has no connections with V1,
was also studied. Compared to control animals, animals with lesions incurred
either 6 weeks after birth or in adulthood showed significant LPul volume loss
following long (> 11 months) survival times. However, no obvious areas of
neuronal degeneration were observed. In addition, estimates of neuronal density
in lesioned hemispheres were similar to those in the non-lesioned hemispheres of 
same animals. Our results support the view that, in marked contrast with the
geniculocortical projection, the pulvinar pathway is largely spared from the most
severe long-term effects of V1 lesions, whether incurred in early postnatal or
adult life. This difference can be linked to the more divergent pattern of
pulvinar connectivity to the visual cortex, including strong reciprocal
connections with extrastriate areas. The results also caution against
interpretation of volume loss in brain structures as a marker for neuronal
degeneration.

BACKGROUND: Food avoidance secondary to disease or stress can lead to weight loss
and rapid deterioration of clinical condition in the common marmoset (Callithrix 
jacchus). Currently, there are no data supporting the use of any pharmaceuticals 
as an appetite stimulant in this species; however, benzodiazepines are frequently
used for this purpose in other species.
METHODS: Six marmosets were used in a crossover study design to evaluate the
benzodiazepine midazolam as an appetite stimulant and anxiolytic. Total food
intake (TFI) and latency to eat (LTE) were measured following administration of
oral and injectable midazolam in non-anxious and anxious states.
RESULTS: Injectable midazolam increased TFI and decreased LTE in anxious
marmosets, but had no effect in non-anxious animals. Oral midazolam had no effect
on appetite in either state.
CONCLUSIONS: Injectable midazolam may be an effective treatment for
anxiety-induced inappetence in marmosets. Individual response to both oral and
injectable midazolam may vary.

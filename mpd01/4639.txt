Thermogenic capacity and brown adipose tissue activity in the common marmoset.

Rothwell NJ, Stock MJ.

Resting oxygen consumption was measured in anaesthetized male and female common
marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) at 29 degrees C. Injection of noradrenaline caused
a marked increase in oxygen consumption (63%), but this response was lower in
males. Large deposits (750 mg) of brown adipose tissue (BAT) were dissected from 
the cervical, subscapular, axillary and perirenal areas. High levels of guanosine
diphosphate binding to isolated brown fat mitochondria were observed, indicating 
that the thermogenic proton conductance pathway is very active in brown fat from 
the marmoset. High levels of brown adipose tissue thermogenesis in these animals 
may be related to a requirement for diet-induced thermogenesis.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a highly vocal New World primate
species that has emerged in recent years as a promising model system for studies 
of auditory and vocal processing. Our recent studies have examined perceptual
mechanisms related to the pitch of harmonic complex tones in this species.
However, no previous psychoacoustic work has measured marmosets' frequency
discrimination abilities for pure tones across a broad frequency range. Here we
systematically examined frequency difference limens (FDLs), which measure the
minimum discriminable frequency difference between two pure tones, in marmosets
across most of their hearing range. Results show that marmosets' FDLs are
comparable to other New World primates, with lowest values in the frequency range
of ∼3.5-14 kHz. This region of lowest FDLs corresponds with the region of lowest 
hearing thresholds in this species measured in our previous study and also with
the greatest concentration of spectral energy in the major types of marmoset
vocalizations. These data suggest that frequency discrimination in the common
marmoset may have evolved to match the hearing sensitivity and spectral
characteristics of this species' vocalizations.

The timing of de novo DNA methylation in male germ cells during human testicular 
development is yet unsolved. Apart from that, the stability of established
imprinting patterns in vitro is controversially discussed. This study aimed at
determining the timing of DNA de novo methylation and at assessing the stability 
of the methylation status in vitro. We employed the marmoset monkey (Callithrix
jacchus) as it is considered the best non-human primate model for human
testicular development. We selected neonatal, pre-pubertal, pubertal, and adult
animals (n = 3, each) and assessed germ cell global DNA methylation levels by
5-methyl cytosine staining, and Alu elements and gene-specific methylation (H19, 
LIT1, SNRPN, MEST, OCT4, MAGE-A4, and DDX-4) by pyrosequencing. De novo
methylation is progressively established during postnatal primate development and
continues until adulthood, a process that is different in most other species.
Importantly, once established, methylation patterns remained stable, as
demonstrated using in vitro cultures. Thus, the marmoset monkey is a unique model
for the study of postnatal DNA methylation mechanisms in germ cells and for the
identification of epimutations and their causes.

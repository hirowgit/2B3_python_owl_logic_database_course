17β-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (17β-HSD1) is involved in the
biosynthesis of estradiol, the major bioactive endogenous estrogen in mammals,
and constitutes an interesting therapeutic target for estrogen-dependent
diseases. A steroidal derivative,
3-{[(16β,17β)-3-(2-bromoethyl)-17-hydroxyestra-1,3,5(10)-trien-16-yl]methyl}
benzamide (PBRM), has recently been described as a non-estrogenic, irreversible
inhibitor of 17β-HSD1. However, the mode of action of this inhibitor and its
selectivity profile have not yet been elucidated. We assessed PBRM potency via in
vitro kinetic measurements. The mechanism of enzyme inactivation was also
investigated using interspecies (human, mouse, pig and monkey) comparisons via
both in vitro assays and in silico analysis. Mouse and human plasma protein
binding of PBRM was determined, whereas its selectivity of action was studied
using a wide range of potential off-targets (e.g. GPCR, hERG, CYPs, etc.). The
affinity constant (Ki=368nM) and the enzyme inactivation rate (kinact=0.087min-1)
values for PBRM were determined with purified 17β-HSD1. PBRM was found to be
covalently linked to the enzyme. A long delay period (i.e. 3-5days) is required
to recover 17β-HSD1 activity following a pretreatment of breast and placenta cell
lines with PBRM. Mechanistic analyses showed important interspecies differences
of 17β-HSD1 inhibition which support the importance of inactivation for PBRM
effect. Evidences of the potency and selectivity of action presented herein for
this first non-estrogenic and steroidal covalent irreversible inhibitor of
17β-HSD1 warrant its further development as a potential drug candidate for
estrogen-dependent disorders.

The transcription repressor FOXP2 is a crucial player in nervous system evolution
and development of humans and songbirds. In order to provide an additional
insight into its functional role we compared target gene expression levels
between human neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y) stably overexpressing FOXP2 cDNA of
either humans or the common chimpanzee, Rhesus monkey, and marmoset,
respectively. RNA-seq led to identification of 27 genes with differential
regulation under the control of human FOXP2, which were previously reported to
have FOXP2-driven and/or songbird song-related expression regulation. RT-qPCR and
Western blotting indicated differential regulation of additional 13 new target
genes in response to overexpression of human FOXP2. These genes may be directly
regulated by FOXP2 considering numerous matches of established FOXP2-binding
motifs as well as publicly available FOXP2-ChIP-seq reads within their putative
promoters. Ontology analysis of the new and reproduced targets, along with their 
interactors in a network, revealed an enrichment of terms relating to cellular
signaling and communication, metabolism and catabolism, cellular migration and
differentiation, and expression regulation. Notably, terms including the words
"neuron" or "axonogenesis" were also enriched. Complementary literature screening
uncovered many connections to human developmental (autism spectrum disease,
schizophrenia, Down syndrome, agenesis of corpus callosum,
trismus-pseudocamptodactyly, ankyloglossia, facial dysmorphology) and
neurodegenerative diseases and disorders (Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and
Huntington's diseases, Lewy body dementia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). Links 
to deafness and dyslexia were detected, too. Such relations existed for single
proteins (e.g., DCDC2, NURR1, PHOX2B, MYH8, and MYH13) and groups of proteins
which conjointly function in mRNA processing, ribosomal recruitment, cell-cell
adhesion (e.g., CDH4), cytoskeleton organization, neuro-inflammation, and
processing of amyloid precursor protein. Conspicuously, many links pointed to an 
involvement of the FOXP2-driven network in JAK/STAT signaling and the regulation 
of the ezrin-radixin-moesin complex. Altogether, the applied phylogenetic
perspective substantiated FOXP2's importance for nervous system development,
maintenance, and functioning. However, the study also disclosed new regulatory
pathways that might prove to be useful for understanding the molecular background
of the aforementioned developmental disorders and neurodegenerative diseases.

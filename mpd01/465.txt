Specialization of the left and right hemispheres to control behavioural responses
may represent one of the mechanisms underlying individual differences in
personality structure, as well as the preferential use of one hand. The present
study investigated the relationship between personality and hand preference in
common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus), a little New World monkey that presents
highly consistent and stable individual hand preferences for simple reaching. To 
address this issue, data on 56 different behaviours from the species' behavioural
repertoire were measured in 10 different laboratory tests and during observations
under social conditions on 16 adult common marmosets. Stable behavioural
variables were aggregated a priori into 13 personality traits. Exploratory Factor
Analysis (EFA) on personality traits was carried out to verify the presence of
major personality factors, and their relationship with direction and strength of 
individual hand preferences was assessed by multiple regression, taking into
account sex and age of the subjects. The largest number of species-specific
behaviours so far investigated in this species was taken into account and robust 
temporal stability between two testing periods was verified. We confirm that
common marmosets are characterized by specific and stable personality profiles. A
single personality factor, accounting for about 38% of the total variance, was
found by EFA, that describes the interest towards unusual and new experiences and
resembles the human Openness domain. The strength of the hand preference was
found to be predicted by this personality factor, that we named Inquisitiveness. 
Present results highlight common marmoset as a useful primate model for the study
of the relationship between personality and lateralization.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a small New World non-human primate
indigenous to northeastern Brazil. This species has been attracting the attention
of biomedical researchers and neuroscientists for its ease of handling and colony
maintenance, unique behavioral characteristics, and several human-like traits,
such as enriched social vocal communication and strong relationships between
parents and offspring. Its high reproductive efficiency makes it particularly
amenable for use in the development of transgenic and genome editing technologies
in a non-human primate model. Our group has recently generated transgenic
marmosets with germ line transmission, opening new avenues in primate research.
In this chapter, we describe recent advances in neuroscience and disease research
using common marmosets, and we outline potential uses of genome editing in
non-human primates toward the development of knock-in/knock-out marmosets.

Positron emission tomography (PET) is a molecular imaging modality that can
visualize functional neurochemical processes throughout the brain in the living
condition, and is useful in bridging the gap between experimental animals and
humans. We applied PET to common marmosets to study the brain mechanisms
underlying social behaviors. Common marmosets are known for their high level of
sociality within a cooperative breeding system, which is rare among non-human
primates, and they could represent valuable animals for studying human-like
social behaviors. PET successfully revealed a brain-molecular relationship
underlying social traits and a functional brain network associated with social
situations in common marmosets. Marmoset PET appears likely to prove useful in
understanding the neurobiological mechanisms underpinning social behaviors in
both physiological and pathological conditions, and has potential for simulating 
psychiatric disorders.

A mini-atlas of the brain is designed to help students and young researchers who 
are not familiar with neuroanatomy. In the mini-atlas, a limited number of
important nuclei and fiber tracts are shown on a small number of brain sections
from posterior end to the anterior end of the brain. The first mini-atlas was
introduced for the rat brain (Watson et al., 2010). Here we present a mini-atlas 
of the common marmoset (Callithrix jaccus), which is one of representative
experimental primates for modern neuroscience. We further discuss the differences
of brain structures between rodents and primates.

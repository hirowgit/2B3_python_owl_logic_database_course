A peptide purified from human ovarian follicular fluid (hOFFP) was administered
during the follicular phase of post-partum marmosets. Four of the five animals
treated with hOFFP, ovulated as evidenced by the presence of ovarian stigmata at 
the time of laparotomy. However, only 2 of these animals became pregnant, one had
a normal delivery while the other aborted. A shortening of the luteal phase was
observed in the other three animals and all animals conceived in subsequent
cycles. The results indicated that treatment with the ovarian follicular fluid
peptide resulted in impairment of fertility as a result of luteal insufficiency.

administration of antiserum to chicken riboflavin carrier protein.

The presence of protein(s) which is immunologically and functionally similar to
the well characterised avian riboflavin carrier protein has been demonstrated in 
female common marmosets during pregnancy. The protein(s) that interacts with
[14C]riboflavin has an immunological homology to chicken riboflavin carrier
protein. The termination of pregnancy in four out of six marmosets following
administration of antiserum to chicken riboflavin carrier protein supports the
hypothesis that vitamin carrier protein ensures an uninterrupted supply of the
vitamin to the growing embryo and that immunoneutralization of maternal
riboflavin carrier protein leads to fetal death and termination of pregnancy.

In 2019, a new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was detected in China. Severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was capable to infect domestic
and captive mammals like cats, tigers and minks. Due to genetic similarities,
concern about the infection of non-human primates (NHPs) and the establishment of
a sylvatic cycle has grown in the Americas. In this study, neotropical primates
(NP) were sampled in different areas from Brazil to investigate whether they were
infected by SARS-CoV-2. A total of 89 samples from 51 NP of four species were
examined. No positive samples were detected via RT-qPCR, regardless of the NHP
species, tissue or habitat tested. This work provides the first report on the
lack of evidence of the circulation of SARS-CoV-2 in NP. The expansion of wild
animals sampling is necessary to understand their role in the epidemiology of
SARS-CoV-2 and other potentially zoonotic pathogens in natural environments
shared by humans.

BACKGROUND: Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a major causative agent of acute hepatitis
worldwide, prompting continuous HEV vaccine efforts. Vaccine development is
hampered by the lack of convenient animal models susceptible to infection with
different HEV genotypes. We produced recombinant open reading frame 2 protein
(pORF2; p551) of HEV genotype (GT) 3 and assessed its immunogenicity and
protectivity against HEV challenge in common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus, CM).
METHODS: p551 with consensus sequence corresponding to amino acid residues
110-660 of HEV GT3 pORF2 was expressed in E. coli and purified by affinity
chromatography. CMs were immunized intramuscularly with 20 μg of p551 VLPs with
alum adjuvant (n = 4) or adjuvant alone (n = 2) at weeks 0, 3, 7 and 19. At week 
27, p551-immunized and control animals were challenged with HEV GT1 or GT3 and
thereafter longitudinally screened for markers of liver function, anti-HEV IgG
and HEV RNA in feces and sera.
RESULTS: Purified p551 formed VLPs with particle size of 27.71 ± 2.42 nm. Two
immunizations with p551 induced anti-HEV IgG mean titer of 1:1810. Immunized CMs 
challenged with homologous and heterologous HEV genotype did not develop HEV
infection during the follow-up. Control CMs infected with both HEV GT1 and GT3
demonstrated signs of HEV infection with virus shedding and elevation of the
levels of liver enzymes. High levels of anti-HEV IgG persisted in vaccinated CMs 
and control CMs that resolved HEV infection, for up to two years post challenge.
CONCLUSIONS: CMs are shown to be a convenient laboratory animal model susceptible
to infection with HEV GT1 and GT3. Immunization with HEV GT3 ORF2/p551 triggers
potent anti-HEV antibody response protecting CMs from homologous and heterologous
HEV challenge. This advances p551 in VLPs as a prototype vaccine against HEV.

BACKGROUND: The common marmoset has been used as an experimental animal for
various purposes. Because its average weight ranges from 250 to 500 g, weight
loss quickly becomes critical for sick animals. Therefore, effective and
non-stressful treatment for chronic diseases, including diarrhoea, is essential.
CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case in which faecal microbiota transplantation
(FMT) led to immediate recovery from chronic and recurrent diarrhoea caused by
Clostridium difficile infection. A male common marmoset experienced chronic
diarrhoea after antibiotic treatments. The animal experienced severe weight loss,
and a faecal sample was confirmed to be C. difficile-positive but was negative
for protozoa. Metronidazole was partially effective at the first administration
but not after the recurrence of the clinical signs. Then, oral FMT was
administered to the subject by feeding fresh faeces from healthy individuals
mixed with the marmoset's usual food. We monitored the faeces by categorization
into four groups: normal, loose, diarrhoea, and watery. After the first day of
FMT treatment, the marmoset underwent a remarkable recovery from diarrhoea, and
after the fourth day of treatment, a test for C. difficile was negative. The
clinical signs did not recur. The marmoset recovered from sinusitis and bilateral
dacryocystitis, which also did not recur, as a by-product of the improvement in
its general health caused by the cessation of diarrhoea after the FMT.
CONCLUSION: This is the first reported case of successful treatment of a marmoset
using oral FMT. As seen in human patients, FMT was effective for the treatment of
recurrent C. difficile infection in a captive marmoset.

For over half a century now, primate vocalizations have been thought to undergo
little or no experience-dependent acoustic changes during development [1]. If any
changes are apparent, then they are routinely (and quite reasonably) attributed
to the passive consequences of growth. Indeed, previous experiments on squirrel
monkeys and macaque monkeys showed that social isolation [2, 3], deafness [2],
cross-fostering [4] and parental absence [5] have little or no effect on vocal
development. Here, we explicitly test in marmoset monkeys-a very vocal and
cooperatively breeding species [6]-whether the transformation of immature into
mature contact calls by infants is influenced by contingent parental vocal
feedback. Using a closed-loop design, we experimentally provided more versus less
contingent vocal feedback to twin infant marmoset monkeys over their first
2 months of life, the interval during which their contact calls transform from
noisy, immature calls to tonal adult-like "phee" calls [7, 8]. Infants who
received more contingent feedback had a faster rate of vocal development,
producing mature-sounding contact calls earlier than the other twin. The
differential rate of vocal development was not linked to genetics, perinatal
experience, or body growth; nor did the amount of contingency influence the
overall rate of spontaneous vocal production. Thus, we provide the first
experimental evidence for production-related vocal learning during the
development of a nonhuman primate.

Reproduction of wild-caught and laboratory-born marmoset species used in
biomedical research (Saguinus sp, Callithrix jacchus).

Wolfe LG, Deinhardt F, Ogden JD, Adams MR, Fisher LE.

Reproductive performances of wild-caught and laboratory-born marmosets maintained
in a paired-cage system were summarized. Wild-caught, white-lipped (WL) marmosets
(Saguinus fuscicollis, S nigricollis) averaged 2.6 live births per pair per yr
compared with 1.6 for cotton-topped (CT) marmosets (S oedipus); S fuscicollis
illigeri pairs were the best producers. Of first and second generation
laboratory-born animals, crossbred or hybrid WL pairs were the best producers;
first generation pairs averaged 2.7 live births per pair per yr, comparable to
the production of wild-caught WL pairs. In contrast, laboratory-born Sf illigeri 
pairs produced only 0.8 live births per pair per yr. No significant differences
in reproductive performance were observed between first generation outbred vs
inbred and between parent-reared vs hand-reared pairs. Based on limited data, the
reproductive capabilities of wild-caught and laboratory-born Callithrix jacchus
appeared superior to both WL and CT marmosets. Ten examples of marmoset models in
biomedical research were discussed briefly.

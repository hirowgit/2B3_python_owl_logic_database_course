An outbreak of shigellosis in laboratory marmosets and tamarins (Family:
Callithricidae).

Cooper JE, Needham JR.

An outbreak of shigellosis due to Shigella sonnei, is reported in laboratory
maintained marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) and tamarins (Saguinus nigricollis).
The clinical signs and pathological lesions are described and the microbiological
findings discussed. Control of the disease was based upon hygiene and antibiotic 
therapy and the consequences of this approach are described in detail.

Comparative autoradiographic and metabolic study of delta8- and
delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol in the brain of the marmoset Callithrix jacchus.

Erdmann G, Just WW, Thel S, Werner G, Wiechmann M.

The label distribution in the brain of the marmoset Callithrix jacchus following 
intravenous application of radioactively labeled delta8-tetrahydrocannabinol
(delta8-THC) and delta9-THC is investigated by autoradiographic technique.
Accumulations of label are observed in nuclei concerned with motor function, in
the optic and acoustic pathways, and a few other structures. Of the two
hydroxylated isomeres which were shown to be equally psychoactive the brain
concentration of 11-OH-delta9-THC was found to be about 3 times higher as
compared with 11-OH-delta8 THC, which may explain why delta9-THC is more potent
than delta8-THC. More than 90% of the radioactivity found in the brain can be
attributed to the THCs and their 11-hydroxylated isomeres. Polar metabolites are 
almost completely absent from the brain.

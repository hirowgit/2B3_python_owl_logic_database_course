Gaze shifts, the directing of the eyes to an approaching predator, preferred food
source, or potential mate, have universal biological significance for the
survival of a species. Our knowledge of gaze behavior is based primarily on
visually triggered responses, whereas head orientation triggered by auditory
stimuli remains poorly characterized. Common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a
diurnal, small-bodied (∼350 g), New World monkey species, known for its rich
behavioral repertoires during social interactions. We used a lightweight head
tracking system to measure marmosets' reflexive head orientations toward a
natural stimulus presented from behind. We found that marmoset could rotate its
head at angular velocities above 1,000°/s and maintained target accuracy for a
wide range of rotation amplitudes (up to 250°). This unusual, saccadic head
orienting behavior offers opportunities for understanding the many biological
factors that have shaped the evolution of sensorimotor controls of gaze
orientation by the primate brain.

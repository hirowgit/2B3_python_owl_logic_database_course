Pregnancy diagnosis in the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus jacchus).

Lunn SF, Hobson BM, Hearn JP.

Abdominal palpation of the uterus was carried out on 25 pregnant and 29
non-pregnant marmosets (Callithrix jacchus jacchus). 195 complete 24-hour urine
specimens, collected between the first week of gestation and term (21 weeks),
were tested with the Sub-Human Primate Tube (SHPT) test. No significant
differences between the two methods in their ability to diagnose pregnancy were
obtained between the first and 13th week of gestation. The SHPT test was seldom
positive after the 13th week of pregnancy, whereas, with one exception, palpation
always indicated pregnancy.

Ureaplasmas in the marmoset (Callithrix jacchus): transmission and elimination.

Furr PM, Hetherington CM, Taylor-Robinson D.

All adult marmosets tested had ureaplasmas in their throats but not in the lower 
respiratory tract, and rarely in the genital tract. Ureaplasmas persisted in the 
throat of a marmoset separated from the colony for 44 days. They could not be
recovered from the animals for at least nine weeks after a course of minocycline.
Airborne reinfection did not occur when these animals were surrounded by, but
separate from, infected marmosets. It occurred when the minocycline-treated
animals were caged with the infected marmosets or were inoculated. The genital
tract was more difficult to infect than the oropharynx.

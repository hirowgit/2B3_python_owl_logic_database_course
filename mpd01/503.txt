Networks of widely distributed regions populate human association cortex. One
network, often called the default network, is positioned at the apex of a
gradient of sequential networks that radiate outward from primary cortex. Here,
extensive anatomical data made available through the Marmoset Brain Architecture 
Project are explored to show a homologue exists in marmoset. Results reveal that 
a gradient of networks extend outward from primary cortex to progressively
higher-order transmodal association cortex in both frontal and temporal cortex.
The apex transmodal network comprises frontopolar and rostral temporal
association cortex, parahippocampal areas TH / TF, the ventral posterior midline,
and lateral parietal association cortex. The positioning of this network in the
gradient and its composition of areas make it a candidate homologue to the human 
default network. That the marmoset, a physiologically- and genetically-accessible
primate, might possess a default-network-like candidate creates opportunities for
study of higher cognitive and social functions.

The default mode network (DMN) is associated with a wide range of brain
functions. In humans, the DMN is marked by strong functional connectivity among
three core regions: medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), posterior parietal cortex
(PPC), and the medial parietal and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). Neuroimaging
studies have shown that the DMN also exists in non-human primates, suggesting
that it may be a conserved feature of the primate brain. Here, we found that, in 
common marmosets, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC; peak at A8aD) has
robust fMRI functional connectivity and reciprocal anatomical connections with
the posterior DMN core regions (PPC and PCC), while the mPFC has weak connections
with the posterior DMN core regions. This strong dlPFC but weak mPFC connectivity
in marmoset differs markedly from the stereotypical DMN in humans. The mPFC may
be involved in brain functions that are further developed in humans than in other
primates.

BACKGROUND: Callithrix jacchus, it is a species highly targeted by wild animal
traffickers and, when apprehended, they need veterinary care. For safe
therapeutic procedures, knowledge of anatomy is essential, as well as for
diagnostic by imaging, good radiographic positioning is essential.
METHODS: The anatomy of the paranasal sinuses and the radiographic projections
was described using 10 carcasses of common marmosets. Radiographs were taken in
two panoramic views of their head: profile and frontal-naso. For the anatomical
study, paramedian and transverse macroscopic sections and microscopic transverse 
sections were performed.
RESULTS: On the radiographs, it was possible to identify the frontal recess and
maxillary sinuses in profile and frontal-naso incidences. In the anatomical
study, the frontal recess and maxillary, sphenoid and ethmoid paranasal sinuses
were identified.
CONCLUSIONS: The ethmoidal sinus could be observed only microscopically and the
sphenoidal sinus difficult to see on the radiography due to the overlapping
adjoining structures.

Intracellular neuronal recordings from the brain of awake nonhuman primates have 
remained difficult to obtain because of several formidable technical challenges, 
such as poor recording stability and difficulties in maintaining long-term
recording conditions. We have developed a technique to record neuronal activity
by using a coaxial guide tube and sharp electrode assembly, which allows
researchers to repeatedly and reliably perform intracellular recordings in the
cortex of awake marmosets. Recordings from individual neurons last from several
minutes to more than an hour. A key advantage of this approach is that it does
not require dura removal, permitting recordings over weeks and months in a single
animal. This protocol describes the step-by-step procedures for construction of a
custom-made marmoset chair, head-cap implantation, preparation of the sharp
electrode and guide tube, neuronal recording and data analysis. As the technique 
is practical and easy to adapt, we anticipate that it can also be applied to
other mammalian models, including larger-size nonhuman primates.

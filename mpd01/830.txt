1. Common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) are potentially useful nonhuman primate 
models for preclinical drug metabolism studies. However, the roles of marmoset
cytochrome P450 (P450) isoforms in the oxidation of endobiotic progesterone have 
not been fully investigated. In this study, the roles of marmoset P450 isoforms
in progesterone hydroxylation were extensively determined. 2. The activities of
liver microsomes from individual marmosets with respect to progesterone 21/17α-
and 16α/6β-hydroxylation were significantly correlated with those for
flurbiprofen 4-hydroxylation and midazolam 1'-hydroxylation, respectively, as
similar correlations have been found in humans. Anti-P450 2 C and 3 A antibodies 
suppressed progesterone 21/17α- and 16α/6β-hydroxylation, respectively, in
marmoset liver microsomes. 3. Recombinant marmoset P450 2C58 and 2C19 catalyzed
progesterone to form 21-hydroxyprogesterone and 16α-hydroxyprogesterone,
respectively, as major products with high maximum velocity/Km values of 0.53 and 
0.089 mL/min/nmol, respectively. Recombinant marmoset P450 3A4/90 oxidized
progesterone to form 6β-hydroxyprogesterone as a major product with homotropic
cooperativity (>1 of Hill coefficients). 4. These results indicate that the
overall activities and roles of liver microsomal P450 enzymes in marmoset livers 
are similar to those in humans, especially for progesterone 21/17α- and
16α/6β-hydroxylation by marmoset P450 2 C and 3 A enzymes, respectively,
suggesting important roles for these P450 enzymes in the metabolism of
endobiotics in marmosets.

Stroke is a common and devastating disease worldwide. Over the last two decades, 
many therapeutic approaches to ameliorate ischaemic stroke have been promising in
animal studies but failed when transferred to the clinical situation. One of the 
possible explanations for these failures is the widespread use of animal models
of cerebral ischemia that do not mimic the pathology encountered in the clinic.
Accordingly, many expert committees recommended the integration of higher order
species such as non-human primates in pre-clinical stroke studies. The common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a small New World monkey, start to stand out in
the neuroscience field as a good compromise between larger primates and rodents. 
In this review, we discuss the relevance of the use of the marmoset in stroke
studies. We will focus on behavioural tests developed in this species to assess
sensorimotor deficits and their recovery during acute and chronic stages of brain
ischaemia. The aim of this appraisal is to provide a comprehensive overview of
the existing approaches to induce stroke in the marmoset as well as the paradigms
for behavioural testing in this species. The data summarized in this review
should contribute to the improvement of future stoke studies in the marmoset and 
accordingly improve the translation of the results from bench to bed.

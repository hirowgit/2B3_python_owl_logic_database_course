Serum biochemical, hematological and body measurement data for common marmosets
(Callithrix jacchus jacchus).

Yarbrough LW, Tollett JL, Montrey RD, Beattie RJ.

Blood samples were drawn and body measurements taken from healthy adult and
juvenile common marmosets which had been housed under controlled environmental
conditions for a minimum of 2 years. Blood was analyzed for serum biochemical and
hematological constituents.

Reproductive performance of three species of Callitrichidae.

Tardif SD, Richter CB, Carson RL.

The reproductive performance of three species of Callitrichidae housed under
identical conditions, including relatively spacious caging and visual screening, 
was compared. The three species were Callithrix jacchus, Saguinus fuscicollis,
and Saguinus oedipus. Callithrix jacchus was the most reliable breeder, with the 
lowest percentage of stillborn and the highest post-weaning survival. While the
reproductive performance of S oedipus was better than that generally reported for
other colonies, the reproductive performance of the Saguinus species was still
poorer than that of C jacchus. The two Saguinus species did not differ
significantly in either percentage of stillborn or post-weaning survival. None of
the species showed infertility due to lactation, but the mean inter-birth
interval was significantly longer for S oedipus than for either C jacchus or S
fuscicollis.

BACKGROUND: Anaesthesia is often required in common marmosets undergoing various 
procedures. The aim of this study was to evaluate anaesthetic and cardiopulmonary
effects of alfaxalone, alfaxalone-ketamine and
alfaxalone-butorphanol-medetomidine in common marmosets.
METHODS: The following treatments were repeatedly administered to seven female
common marmosets: Treatment A, alfaxalone (12 mg kg-1 ) alone; treatment AK,
alfaxalone (1 mg animal-1 ) plus ketamine (2.5 mg animal-1 ); treatment AMB,
alfaxalone (4 mg kg-1 ), medetomidine (50 µg kg-1 ) plus butorphanol (0.3 mg kg-1
); and treatment AMB-Ati, AMB with atipamezole at 45 minutes.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Marmosets became laterally recumbent and unresponsive
for approximately 30 minutes in A and AK and for approximately 60 minutes in AMB.
The animals showed rapid recovery following atipamezole injection in AMB-Ati. The
decrease in heart rate and SpO2 was significantly greater in AMB compared to A
and AK. Oxygen supplementation, anaesthetic monitors and atipamezole should be
available especially when AMB is administered.

The outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 in mainland China with subsequent human to human
transmission worldwide had taken up the shape of a devastating pandemic. The
ability of the virus to infect multiple species other than humans has currently
been reported in experimental conditions. Non-human primates, felines, ferrets,
rodents and host of other animals could previously be infected in experimental
conditions with SARS-CoV and recently with SARS-CoV-2, both virus using
Angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2 receptor for cellular entry. The variations in
sequence homology of ACE2 receptor across species is identified as one of the
factors determining virulence and pathogenicity in animals. The infection in
experimental animals with SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 on most occasions are
asymptomatic, however, the virus could multiply within the respiratory tract and 
extra-pulmonary organs in most of the species. Here, we discuss about the
pathogenicity, transmission, variations in angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2
receptor-binding across species and host pathogen interactions of SARS and
SARS-CoV-2 in laboratory animals used in research.

Analysis of electrophysiological data from Purkinje cells (P-cells) of the
cerebellum presents unique challenges to spike sorting. Complex spikes have
waveforms that vary significantly from one event to the next, raising the problem
of misidentification. Even when complex spikes are detected correctly, the simple
spikes may belong to a different P-cell, raising the danger of misattribution. To
address these identification and attribution problems, we wrote an open-source,
semiautomated software called P-sort, and then tested it by analyzing data from
P-cells recorded in three species: marmosets, macaques, and mice. Like other
sorting software, P-sort relies on nonlinear dimensionality reduction to cluster 
spikes. However, it also uses the statistical relationship between simple and
complex spikes to merge disparate clusters and split a single cluster. In
comparison with expert manual curation, occasionally P-sort identified
significantly more complex spikes, as well as prevented misattribution of
clusters. Three existing automatic sorters performed less well, particularly for 
identification of complex spikes. To improve the development of analysis tools
for the cerebellum, we provide labeled data for 313 recording sessions, as well
as statistical characteristics of waveforms and firing patterns of P-cells in
three species.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Algorithms that perform spike sorting depend on
waveforms to cluster spikes. However, a cerebellar Purkinje-cell produces two
types of spikes; simple and complex spikes. A complex spike coincides with the
suppression of generating simple spikes. Here, we recorded neurophysiological
data from three species and developed a spike analysis software named P-sort that
relies on this statistical property to improve both the detection and the
attribution of simple and complex spikes in the cerebellum.

The unprecedented in recent history global COVID-19 pandemic urged the
implementation of all existing vaccine platforms to ensure the availability of
the vaccines against COVID-19 to every country in the world. Despite the
multitude of high-quality papers describing clinical trials of different vaccine 
products, basic detailed data on general toxicity, reproductive toxicity,
immunogenicity, protective efficacy and durability of immune response in animal
models are scarce. Here, we developed a Î²-propiolactone-inactivated whole virion 
vaccine CoviVac and assessed its safety, protective efficacy, immunogenicity and 
stability of the immune response in rodents and non-human primates. The vaccine
showed no signs of acute/chronic, reproductive, embryo- and fetotoxicity, or
teratogenic effects, as well as no allergenic properties in studied animal
species. The vaccine induced stable and robust humoral immune response both in
form of specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and NAbs in mice, Syrian hamsters, and
common marmosets. The NAb levels did not decrease significantly over the course
of one year. The course of two immunizations protected Syrian hamsters from
severe pneumonia upon intranasal challenge with the live virus. Robustness of the
vaccine manufacturing process was demonstrated as well. These data encouraged
further evaluation of CoviVac in clinical trials.

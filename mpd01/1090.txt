Trematodes from the genus Platynosomum have been found to infect Neotropical
primates in captivity, but little is known about their pathogeny in such hosts.
This study evaluated the physiological effects of natural infection by the
liver-dwelling trematode Platynosomum sp. in ten males and ten females of
Callithrix penicillata kept in captivity at the Primate Center of the University 
of Brasília. The marmosets were examined twice, 6 months apart. The following
parameters were analyzed: complete blood count, bleeding time, serum total
protein, albumin, and the liver enzymes AST and ALT, and both a stool analysis
and a liver ultrasonic evaluation were performed. We were able to characterize a 
group of abnormalities associated with this trematode infection which were mainly
derived from the hepatitis caused by it: coagulation disorders, abnormal red
blood cells, hypoalbuminemia, and abnormal levels of liver-linked serum enzymes. 
Eosinophilia and thrombocytopenia were also commonly seen. All of the
aforementioned abnormalities were in good accord with typical effects of
trematodes on liver parenchyma. We suggest that this set of abnormalities is
characteristic of the infection of C. penicillata with Platynosomum sp., and
should be among the most prominent aspects that the veterinary surgeon considers 
when suspecting such an infection. We also suggest that these clinical signs and 
abnormalities will be similar in other liver-dwelling trematode-infected primate 
species.

We identified a novel repeat family, termed Platy-1, in the Callithrix jacchus
(common marmoset) genome that arose around the time of the divergence of
platyrrhines and catarrhines and established itself as a repeat family in New
World monkeys (NWMs). A full-length Platy-1 element is ∼100 bp in length, making 
it the shortest known short interspersed element (SINE) in primates, and harbors 
features characteristic of non-LTR retrotransposons. We identified 2268
full-length Platy-1 elements across 62 subfamilies in the common marmoset genome.
Our subfamily reconstruction and phylogenetic analyses support Platy-1
propagation throughout the evolution of NWMs in the lineage leading to C. jacchus
Platy-1 appears to have reached its amplification peak in the common ancestor of 
current day marmosets and has since moderately declined. However, identification 
of more than 200 Platy-1 elements identical to their respective consensus
sequence, and the presence of polymorphic elements within common marmoset
populations, suggests ongoing retrotransposition activity. Platy-1, a SINE,
appears to have originated from an Alu element, and hence is likely derived from 
7SL RNA. Our analyses illustrate the birth of a new repeat family and its
propagation dynamics in the lineage leading to the common marmoset over the last 
40 million years.

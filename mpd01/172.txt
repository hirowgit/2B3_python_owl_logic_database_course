Watching others in a positive state does not induce optimism bias in common
marmosets (Callithrix jacchus), but leads to behaviour indicative of competition.

Emotional contagion is suggested to facilitate group life by enhancing
synchronized responses to the environment. Cooperative breeders are an example of
a social system that requires such intricate coordination between individuals.
Therefore, we studied emotional contagion in common marmosets by means of a
judgement bias test. Demonstrators were exposed to an emotion manipulation (i.e.,
positive, negative, control), and observers perceived only the demonstrator's
behaviour. We predicted that the positive or negative states of the demonstrator 
would induce matching states in the observer, indicating emotional contagion. All
subjects' emotional states were assessed through behaviour and cognition, the
latter by means of a judgement bias test. Behavioural results showed a successful
emotion manipulation of demonstrators, with manipulation-congruent expressions
(i.e., positive calls in the positive condition, and negative calls and
pilo-erect tail in the negative condition). Observers showed no
manipulation-congruent expressions, but showed more scratching and arousal after 
the positive manipulation. Concerning the judgement bias test, we predicted that 
subjects in a positive state should increase their response to ambiguous cues
(i.e., optimism bias), and subjects in a negative state should decrease their
response (i.e., pessimism bias). This prediction was not supported as neither
demonstrators nor observers showed such bias in either manipulation. Yet,
demonstrators showed an increased response to the near-positive cue, and
additional analyses showed unexpected responses to the reference cues, as well as
a researcher identity effect. We discuss all results combined, including recently
raised validation concerns of the judgement bias test, and inherent challenges to
empirically studying emotional contagion.

Pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), embryonic stem cells (ESCs), and induced PSCs
(iPSCs) are excellent tools for studying embryonic development in organisms and
classified into naïve and primed states. ESC-derived germline chimera individuals
can be produced by injecting naïve ESCs/iPSCs into preimplantation embryos, and
conversion of primed human ESCs/iPSCs into a naïve state provides insights into
epiblast cell features. Non-human ESCs/iPSCs are alternatives to human naïve
ESCs/iPSCs, which elicit ethical issues. In this study, we used the common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) as an animal model. Since 1996, 16 marmoset ESC
lines have been established. Because most of these ESC lines are female and were 
derived >10 years ago, new ESCs, particularly male marmoset ESC lines, are
needed. Here, we successfully established 17 novel marmoset ESC lines, including 
six male ESC lines from in vitro-fertilized (IVF) embryos and 12 ESC lines under 
feeder-free conditions. This report is the first to establish ESC lines using
feeder-free conditions and IVF preimplantation blastocysts in marmosets, and
these novel ESC lines could potentially facilitate future non-human primate ESC
studies.

Studies in humans and songbirds have revealed a close link between vocal output
and hearing. Now experiments in marmosets have shown that self-generated
vocalizations can modulate the activity of neurons in the auditory cortex and
even remodel their response properties.

PURPOSE: To induce status epilepticus (SE) followed by the subsequent onset of
spontaneous recurrent seizures, thus characterizing a new model of temporal lobe 
epilepsy in a nonhuman primate.
METHODS: Male and female marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) (n = 18), ages between 2 
and 8 years, were injected with domoic acid (0.5-4 mg/kg, i.p.) or saline, and
behaviorally assessed with regard to the presence of acutely induced seizures and
for < or = 6 months for spontaneous seizures. Injection of doses ranging from 3.5
to 4 mg/kg either did not induce SE or resulted in fatal SE. Even a 5-min SE
duration (SE blockade resulting from diazepam injection) proved lethal to
marmosets within 1 h of domoate administration, regardless of intensive care and 
monitoring of the animals. Animals injected with doses ranging from 0.5 to 3
mg/kg that developed only a few minor convulsive signs were allowed a 6-month
survival period for the assessment of spontaneous epileptic events. At the end of
the experiment, 6-month period, or acute intoxication associated with SE
induction, animals were deeply anesthetized and had their brains subjected to
histologic processing for Nissl and delta-FosB.
RESULTS: For the animals injected with domoate that did not develop SE (i.e.,
those that survived), we could not detect any behavioral signs of spontaneous
epileptic seizures in the 6-month observation period, and only minor indications 
of neuropathologic changes (i.e., neuronal death) over Nissl-stained sections, as
well as some small changes in the staining for delta-FosB in a few of the
animals.
CONCLUSIONS: Systemic administration of domoic acid to marmosets is not effective
for the generation of a model of chronic temporal lobe epilepsy. Administration
of domoic acid at doses that do not lead to SE also did not lead to the
development of temporal lobe epilepsy or clear-cut behavioral changes over a
6-month period.

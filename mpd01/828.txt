KEY POINTS: The cortical mechanisms of grasping have been extensively studied in 
macaques and humans; here, we investigated whether common marmosets could rely on
similar mechanisms despite strong differences in hand morphology and grip
diversity. We recorded electrocorticographic activity over the sensorimotor
cortex of two common marmosets during the execution of different grip types,
which allowed us to study cortical activity (power spectrum) and physiologically 
inferred connectivity (phase-slope index). Analyses were performed in beta
(16-35 Hz) and gamma (75-100 Hz) frequency bands and our results showed that beta
power varied depending on grip type, whereas gamma power displayed clear
epoch-related modulation. Strength and direction of inter-area connectivity
varied depending on grip type and epoch. These findings suggest that fundamental 
control mechanisms are conserved across primates and, in future research,
marmosets could represent an adequate model to investigate primate brain
mechanisms.
ABSTRACT: The cortical mechanisms of grasping have been extensively studied in
macaques and humans. Here, we investigated whether common marmosets could rely on
similar mechanisms despite striking differences in manual dexterity. Two common
marmosets were trained to grasp-and-pull three objects eliciting different hand
configurations: whole-hand, finger and scissor grips. The animals were then
chronically implanted with 64-channel electrocorticogram arrays positioned over
the left premotor, primary motor and somatosensory cortex. Power spectra,
reflecting predominantly cortical activity, and phase-slope index, reflecting the
direction of information flux, were studied in beta (16-35 Hz) and gamma
(75-100 Hz) bands. Differences related to grip type, epoch (reach, grasp) and
cortical area were statistically assessed. Results showed that whole-hand and
scissor grips triggered stronger beta desynchronization than finger grip. Task
epochs clearly modulated gamma power, especially for finger and scissor grips.
Considering effective connectivity, finger and scissor grips evoked stronger
outflow from primary motor to premotor cortex, whereas whole-hand grip displayed 
the opposite pattern. These findings suggest that fundamental control mechanisms,
relying on adjustments of cortical activity and connectivity, are conserved
across primates. Consistently, marmosets could represent a good model to
investigate primate brain mechanisms.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is an increasingly popular non-human
primate species for developing transgenic and genomic edited models of
neurological disorders. These models present an opportunity to assess from birth 
the impact of genetic mutations and to identify candidate predictive biomarkers
of early disease onset. In order to apply findings from marmosets to humans, a
cross-species comparison of typical development is essential. Aiming to identify 
similarities, differences, and gaps in knowledge of neurodevelopment, we
evaluated peer-reviewed literature focused on the first 6 months of life of
marmosets and compared to humans. Five major developmental constructs, including 
reflexes and reactions, motor, feeding, self-help, and social, were compared.
Numerous similarities were identified in the developmental sequences with
differences often influenced by the purpose of the behavior, specifically for
marmoset survival. The lack of detailed knowledge of marmoset development was
exposed as related to the vast resources for humans.

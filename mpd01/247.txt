Perceptual sensitivity varies from moment to moment. One potential source of this
variability is spontaneous fluctuations in cortical activity that can travel as
waves1. Spontaneous travelling waves have been reported during anaesthesia2-7,
but it is not known whether they have a role during waking perception. Here,
using newly developed analytic techniques to characterize the moment-to-moment
dynamics of noisy multielectrode data, we identify spontaneous waves of activity 
in the extrastriate visual cortex of awake, behaving marmosets (Callithrix
jacchus). In monkeys trained to detect faint visual targets, the timing and
position of spontaneous travelling waves before target onset predicted the
magnitude of target-evoked activity and the likelihood of target detection. By
contrast, spatially disorganized fluctuations of neural activity were much less
predictive. These results reveal an important role for spontaneous travelling
waves in sensory processing through the modulation of neural and perceptual
sensitivity.

Nonhuman primates (NHPs) are an essential research model for gaining a
comprehensive understanding of the neural mechanisms of neurocognitive aging in
our own species. In the present study, we used resting state functional
connectivity (rsFC) to investigate the relationship between prefrontal cortical
and striatal neural interactions, and cognitive flexibility, in unanaesthetized
common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) at two time points during late middle age
(8 months apart, similar to a span of 5-6 years in humans). Based on our previous
findings, we also determine the reproducibility of connectivity measures over the
course of 8 months, particularly previously observed sex differences in rsFC.
Male marmosets exhibited remarkably similar patterns of stronger functional
connectivity relative to females and greater cognitive flexibility between the
two imaging time points. Network analysis revealed that the consistent sex
differences in connectivity and related cognitive associations were characterized
by greater node strength and/or degree values in several prefrontal, premotor and
temporal regions, as well as stronger intra PFC connectivity, in males compared
to females. The current study supports the existence of robust sex differences in
prefrontal and striatal resting state networks that may contribute to differences
in cognitive function and offers insight on the neural systems that may be
compromised in cognitive aging and age-related conditions such as mild cognitive 
impairment and Alzheimer's disease.

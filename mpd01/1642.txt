The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a small New World primate that has
increasingly been used as a non-human model in the fields of sensory, motor, and 
cognitive neuroscience. However, little knowledge exists regarding behavioral
methods in this species. Developing an understanding of the neural basis of
perception and cognition in an animal model requires measurement of both brain
activity and behavior. Here we describe an operant conditioning behavioral
training method developed to allow controlled psychoacoustic measurements in
marmosets. We demonstrate that marmosets can be trained to consistently perform a
Go/No-Go auditory task in which a subject licks at a feeding tube when it detects
a sound. Correct responses result in delivery of a food reward. Crucially, this
operant conditioning task generates little body movement and is well suited for
pairing behavior with single-unit electrophysiology. Successful implementation of
an operant conditioning behavior opens the door to a wide range of new studies in
the field of auditory neuroscience using the marmoset as a model system.

Selective blockade of serotonin 2A (5-HT2A) receptors is a promising strategy to 
reduce L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA)-induced dyskinesia and has shown
efficacy in a Phase III clinical trial for dopaminergic psychosis in Parkinson's 
disease (PD). However, pre-clinical and clinical evidence suggest that, while
this approach may be effective and well tolerated, there might be a ceiling
beyond which no further therapeutic benefit might be achieved. There is mounting 
evidence that 5-HT2A receptors form a functional hetero-complex with metabotropic
glutamate 2 (mGlu2) receptors, with antagonism of 5-HT2A receptors and activation
of mGlu2 receptors producing similar effects on the Gi/Gq signalling ratio at the
intra-cellular level. Based on this interaction between 5-HT2A and mGlu2
receptors, we hypothesised that activation of mGlu2 receptors would alleviate
dyskinesia and psychosis in PD. LY-354,740 is a selective mGlu2/3 orthosteric
agonist that was previously tested in the clinic. In experiments conducted in the
6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-lesioned rat and the
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-lesioned marmoset, we found
that mGlu2/3 activation with LY-354,740 significantly reduced the expression of
dyskinesia and psychosis-like behaviours, while simultaneously enhancing l-DOPA
therapeutic benefit. Moreover, mGlu2/3 activation with LY-354,740 attenuated the 
development of dyskinesia. These data indicate that activation of mGlu2/3
receptors is a therapeutic strategy that may provide relief for both motor
and-non-motor treatment-related complications in PD.

Traditionally, the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and the inferior
pulvinar (IPul) nucleus are considered as anatomically and functionally distinct 
thalamic nuclei. However, in several primate species it has also been established
that the koniocellular (K) layers of LGN and parts of the IPul have a shared
pattern of immunoreactivity for the calcium-binding protein calbindin. These
calbindin-rich cells constitute a thalamic matrix system which is implicated in
thalamocortical synchronisation. Further, the K layers and IPul are both involved
in visual processing and have similar connections with retina and superior
colliculus. Here, we confirmed the continuity between calbindin-rich cells in LGN
K layers and the central lateral division of IPul (IPulCL) in marmoset monkeys.
By employing a high-throughput neuronal tracing method, we found that both the K 
layers and IPulCL form comparable patterns of connections with striate and
extrastriate cortices; these connections are largely different to those of the
parvocellular and magnocellular laminae of LGN. Retrograde tracer-labelled cells 
and anterograde tracer-labelled axon terminals merged seamlessly from IPulCL into
LGN K layers. These results support continuity between LGN K layers and IPulCL,
providing an anatomical basis for functional congruity of this region of the
dorsal thalamic matrix and calling into question the traditional segregation
between LGN and the inferior pulvinar nucleus.

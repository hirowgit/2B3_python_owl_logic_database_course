Gelatin as a vehicle for food and vitamin administration to marmosets.

Pereira LH, Melo AL, Resende DM.

For a period of three years, gelatin was used as a vehicle for administration of 
food, vitamin complex and drugs to laboratory maintained Callithrix penicillata
and Callithrix jacchus marmosets and a breeding colony of C. penicillata. In both
circumstances, results were satisfactory. The animals survived for long periods
of time, with adult, young and juvenile primates in the breeding colony showing
good physical condition.

Establishment and characterization of a chronic infectious mononucleosislike
syndrome in common marmosets.

Emini EA, Luka J, Armstrong ME, Banker FS, Provost PJ, Pearson GR.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was inoculated into two species of marmosets. Successful
infection was established in the majority of the animals of one species,
Callithrix jacchus, as evidenced by the development of high, persistent levels of
antibody against virus-specific capsid and early nonstructural proteins.
Antibodies also were produced against the major membrane antigen and, in some
animals, against EBV nuclear antigen (EBNA) 2 but not against EBNA 1. This is the
antibody profile normally noted in individuals with chronic infectious
mononucleosis (IM). EBV-induced lymphoproliferation was not seen, and
EBV-specific proteins were not detected in the peripheral blood lymphocytes of
infected animals. Hence, EBV infection in C. jacchus apparently does not
generally include extensive B-cell involvement. However, the marmosets clearly
are useful as a model for EBV primary infection and also possibly for chronic IM.

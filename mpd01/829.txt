The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is an increasingly popular non-human
primate species for developing transgenic and genomic edited models of
neurological disorders. These models present an opportunity to assess from birth 
the impact of genetic mutations and to identify candidate predictive biomarkers
of early disease onset. In order to apply findings from marmosets to humans, a
cross-species comparison of typical development is essential. Aiming to identify 
similarities, differences, and gaps in knowledge of neurodevelopment, we
evaluated peer-reviewed literature focused on the first 6 months of life of
marmosets and compared to humans. Five major developmental constructs, including 
reflexes and reactions, motor, feeding, self-help, and social, were compared.
Numerous similarities were identified in the developmental sequences with
differences often influenced by the purpose of the behavior, specifically for
marmoset survival. The lack of detailed knowledge of marmoset development was
exposed as related to the vast resources for humans.

1. Common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) are potentially useful nonhuman primate 
models for preclinical drug metabolism studies. However, the roles of marmoset
cytochrome P450 (P450) isoforms in the oxidation of endobiotic progesterone have 
not been fully investigated. In this study, the roles of marmoset P450 isoforms
in progesterone hydroxylation were extensively determined. 2. The activities of
liver microsomes from individual marmosets with respect to progesterone 21/17α-
and 16α/6β-hydroxylation were significantly correlated with those for
flurbiprofen 4-hydroxylation and midazolam 1'-hydroxylation, respectively, as
similar correlations have been found in humans. Anti-P450 2 C and 3 A antibodies 
suppressed progesterone 21/17α- and 16α/6β-hydroxylation, respectively, in
marmoset liver microsomes. 3. Recombinant marmoset P450 2C58 and 2C19 catalyzed
progesterone to form 21-hydroxyprogesterone and 16α-hydroxyprogesterone,
respectively, as major products with high maximum velocity/Km values of 0.53 and 
0.089 mL/min/nmol, respectively. Recombinant marmoset P450 3A4/90 oxidized
progesterone to form 6β-hydroxyprogesterone as a major product with homotropic
cooperativity (>1 of Hill coefficients). 4. These results indicate that the
overall activities and roles of liver microsomal P450 enzymes in marmoset livers 
are similar to those in humans, especially for progesterone 21/17α- and
16α/6β-hydroxylation by marmoset P450 2 C and 3 A enzymes, respectively,
suggesting important roles for these P450 enzymes in the metabolism of
endobiotics in marmosets.

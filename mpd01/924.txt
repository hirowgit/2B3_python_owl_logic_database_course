BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) psychosis is encountered in as many as 50%
of patients with advanced disease. Treatment options for PD psychosis are few. In
fact, only clozapine and pimavanserin have shown efficacy in randomised
controlled trials. Clinicians are often reluctant to prescribe the former, due to
the risk of agranulocytosis, while the latter is not widely available yet.
Because it is already clinically available and exhibits high affinity for
serotonin 2A receptors, a target with which both clozapine and pimavanserin
interact, we hypothesised that the anti-depressant mirtazapine might be effective
to alleviate PD psychosis.
METHODS: Here, we tested the anti-psychotic potential of mirtazapine in the
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-lesioned common marmoset.
Five MPTP-lesioned marmosets exhibiting psychosis-like behaviours were
administered L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) in combination with
mirtazapine (0.1, 1 and 10 mg/kg) or vehicle. We also tested the effect of
mirtazapine on L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia.
RESULTS: The addition of mirtazapine 10 mg/kg to L-DOPA reduced psychosis-like
behaviours by 50% (P < 0.05) and dyskinesia by 29% (P < 0.01), when compared to
L-DOPA/vehicle. Importantly, the antipsychotic and antidyskinetic effects of
mirtazapine were achieved without hindering L-DOPA anti-parkinsonian action.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that mirtazapine may be effective to alleviate
PD psychosis and, because the drug is clinically available, clinical trials that 
would assess its anti-psychotic efficacy in PD could be rapidly undertaken,
hopefully leading to a new treatment option for this debilitating condition.

Primates have markedly lower total energy expenditure (TEE; kcal/day) than other 
placental mammals, expending approximately 50% less energy for their mass than
non-primate eutherians. However, little is known regarding interspecific
variation of energy expenditure within platyrrhine primates. We investigated TEE 
in captive tufted capuchins (Sapajus apella, n = 8, ages 7-36), a frugivorous
platyrrhine, to compare TEE with other placental mammals and primates. We tested 
the hypothesis that large-brained capuchins would exhibit greater TEE than other 
platyrrhines that are less encephalized. We used the doubly labeled water (DLW)
method to measure TEE over 7-11 days, during which physical activity data were
recorded via focal observation. TEE was strongly correlated with fat free mass,
but sex, age, and rates of walking and climbing were not correlated with
variation in TEE in multivariate analyses controlling for fat free mass. We found
evidence that daily physical activity was negatively correlated with body fat
percentage. Capuchin TEE was similar (P = 0.67) to other, less encephalized
platyrrhines (Callithrix and Alouatta) and 54% lower than other placental
mammals, in analyses controlling for body mass. These results suggest that brain 
size and physical activity do not necessarily influence variation in daily energy
expenditure across primate species.

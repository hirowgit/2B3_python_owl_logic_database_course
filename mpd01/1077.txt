Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is a main characteristic in exudative type of 
age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Our study aimed to evaluate the effects
of edaravone, a free radical scavenger on laser-induced CNV. CNV was induced by
laser photocoagulation to the subretinal choroidal area of mice and common
marmosets. Edaravone was administered either intraperitoneally twice a day for 2 
weeks or intravenously just once after laser photocoagulation. The effects of
edaravone on laser-induced CNV were evaluated by fundus fluorescein angiography, 
CNV area measurements, and the expression of 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE) modified
proteins, a marker of oxidative stress. Furthermore, the effects of edaravone on 
the production of H2O2-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) and vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced cell proliferation were evaluated using 
human retinal pigment epithelium cells (ARPE-19) and human retinal microvascular 
endothelial cells, respectively. CNV areas in the edaravone-treated group were
significantly smaller in mice and common marmosets. The expression of 4-HNE
modified proteins was upregulated 3 h after laser photocoagulation, and
intravenously administered edaravone decreased it. In in vitro studies, edaravone
inhibited H2O2-induced ROS production and VEGF-induced cell proliferation. These 
findings suggest that edaravone may protect against laser-induced CNV by
inhibiting oxidative stress and endothelial cell proliferation.

Methylmercury (MeHg) is known to selectively damage the calcarine and precentral 
cortices along deep sulci and fissures in adult cases, but the detailed mechanism
is still unclear. This study aims to identify and analyze the differential
proteome expression in two regions of the cerebrum (the frontal lobe and the
occipital lobe including the calcarine sulcus) of the common marmoset exposed to 
MeHg using a shot-gun proteomic approach. A total of 1045 and 1062 proteins were 
identified in the frontal lobe (FL) and occipital lobe (OL), of which, 62 and 89 
proteins were found significantly changed with MeHg exposure. Functional
enrichment/depletion analysis showed that the lipid metabolic process and
proteolysis were affected in both two lobes. Functional changes in FL were
characterized in cell cycle and cell division, sulfur compound metabolic process,
microtubule-based process and glycerolipid metabolic process. In comparison,
proteins were enriched in the functions of transport, carbohydrate metabolic
process, chemical caused homeostasis and regulation of body fluid levels in OL.
Pathway analysis predicted that vasopressin-regulated water reabsorption was
disturbed in MeHg-treated FL. Our results showed that MeHg induced regional
specific protein changes in FL and OL but with similar endpoint effects such as
energy diminish and disruption of water transport. APOE and GPX1 were shown to be
possible key proteins targeted by MeHg leading to multiple functional changes in 
OL. This is the first report of the whole proteome changes of primate cerebrum
for MeHg neurotoxicity, and the results will contribute to the understanding of
molecular basis of MeHg intoxication in humans.

Objectives In order to facilitate the study of vocalizations in emerging genetic 
common marmoset models of neurodegenerative disorders, we aimed to analyze
call-type changes across age in a translational research environment. We
hypothesized that acoustic parameters of vocalizations would change with age,
reflecting growth of the vocal apparatus and a maturation of control needed to
make adult-like calls. Methods Nineteen developing common marmosets were
longitudinally video- and audio-recorded between the ages of 1-149 days in a
naturalistic setting without any vocalization elicitation protocol. Vocalizations
were coded for call type (cry, tsik, trill, phee, and trill-phee) and analyzed
for duration (sec), minimum and maximum frequency (Hz), and bandwidth (Hz). Mixed
model linear regressions were performed to assess the effects of age on call
parameters listed above for each call type. Results Cries decreased in duration
(P = 0.038), maximum frequency (P = 0.047), and bandwidth (P = 0.023) with age.
Tsik calls decreased in duration (P = 0.002) and increased in minimum frequency
(P = 0.004) and maximum frequency (P = 0.005) with age. Trill calls increased in 
duration (P = 0.003), and trillphee bandwidth (P = 0.031) decreased with age.
Discussion Our results demonstrate that development of common marmoset
vocalizations is call type dependent and that changes in acoustic parameters can 
be detected without complex vocalization elicitation paradigms or specialized
audio recording equipment. Thus, we demonstrate the feasibility of a naturalistic
protocol to collect and objectively analyze marmoset vocalizations
longitudinally. This approach may be useful for studying vocal communication
deficits in genetic models of neurodegenerative disorders.

BACKGROUND: To date, reference values for 25-OH-vitamin D, parathyroid hormone
(PTH), and calcium in serum of common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) based on a
large sample size are not available.
METHODS: Serum reference values for these parameters were determined and
correlated with sex, age, season of sampling, and time of long bone epiphyseal
closure in captive-housed marmosets.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The 90% reference range for serum 25-OH-vitamin D is
47.40-370.4 nmol/L, for PTH 2.10-30.51 pmol/L, and for calcium 2.08-2.63 mmol/L. 
Lower levels of vitamin D were measured in fall compared with the other seasons. 
Levels of PTH were higher in males than in females, and calcium levels were lower
in younger animals compared with older marmosets. No other effects of age, sex,
season, or timing of growth plate closure were found.

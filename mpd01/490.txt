Recent improvements in correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM)
technology have led to dramatic improvements in the ability to observe tissues
and cells. Fluorescence labeling has been used to visualize the localization of
molecules of interest through immunostaining or genetic modification strategies
for the identification of the molecular signatures of biological specimens. Newer
technologies such as tissue clearing have expanded the field of observation
available for fluorescence labeling; however, the area of correlative observation
available for electron microscopy (EM) remains restricted. In this study, we
developed a large-area CLEM imaging procedure to show specific molecular
localization in large-scale EM sections of mouse and marmoset brain. Target
molecules were labeled with antibodies and sequentially visualized in cryostat
sections using fluorescence and gold particles. Fluorescence images were obtained
by light microscopy immediately after antibody staining. Immunostained sections
were postfixed for EM, and silver-enhanced sections were dehydrated in a graded
ethanol series and embedded in resin. Ultrathin sections for EM were prepared
from fully polymerized resin blocks, collected on silicon wafers, and observed by
multibeam scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Multibeam SEM has made rapid,
large-area observation at high resolution possible, paving the way for the
analysis of detailed structures using the CLEM approach. Here, we describe
detailed methods for large-area CLEM in various tissues of both rodents and
primates.

Evidence of an age-related increase of β-synuclein (SNCB) in several parts of the
visual system including the retina has been reported. SNCB is thought to function
as an antagonist of α-synuclein in neurodegenerative diseases, but the exact role
of SNCB remains unclear. The presented work studies two different aspects of the 
onset and role of SNCB in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). First, the
topographical and intracellular distributions of SNCB in the RPE of non-human
marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus) were evaluated in paraffin-embedded eyes and
RPE whole mounts from different developmental stages (neonatal, adolescent, and
adult). Thus, revealed distinct lifetime-related alterations of the topographical
and intracellular distributions of SNCB in the primate macula compared to the
retinal periphery. Furthermore, the function and influences of SNCB on
ARPE-19 cells and primary porcine RPE (ppRPE) cells were characterized by
exposing these cells with recombinant SNCB (rSNCB) at different concentrations.
Moreover, apoptosis, protein- and mRNA-expression levels of factors of the
p53/MDM2 signaling cascade and inflammation- and oxidation-related genes were
investigated. The observed dose-depended decreased apoptosis rates together with 
the PLD2 mediated activation of the p53 pathway promotes senescence-related
processes in SNCB exposed common ARPE-19 cells from human origin. Further,
increased HMOX1 and NOX4 levels indicate increased oxidative stress and
inflammatory responses triggered by SNCB. The obtained differences in the
distribution of SNCB in primate RPE together with alterations of cellular
functions in rSNCB-exposed RPE cells (e.g., ARPE-19, ppRPE) support SNCB-related 
effects like inflammatory response and stress-related properties on RPE over
lifetime. The possible functional relevance of SNCB in physiological aging
converting into a pathophysiological condition should be investigated in further 
studies.

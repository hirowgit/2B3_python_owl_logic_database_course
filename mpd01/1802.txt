Unfamiliar environments can be a source of stress, fear and anxiety for marmoset 
monkeys. In spite of existing data, the influence of putative anxiolytics on the 
effects of novel environments has yet to be tested in primates. Therefore, the
behavior of adult black tufted-ear marmosets to a single brief (15 min) exposure 
to a novel environment was analyzed in the presence and absence of diazepam
(DZP). Marmosets were pre-treated with vehicle (n=5) or diazepam (0.5 mg/kg, ip; 
n=5) and submitted to a 15 min free exploration trial within a rectangular
open-field arena. DZP-treated subjects, compared to vehicle controls,
demonstrated significantly lower rates of (phee) contact calls and exploration,
while a higher scan duration. Sojourn time in the arena's central zone was also
significantly higher in the former group and sedation was not observed. Thus,
pre-treatment with the benzodiazepine DZP decreased several anxiety-related
behaviors induced by subjecting the marmosets to a new environment. The results
also indicate that, as with rodent subjects, the open-field may provide a useful 
simple paradigm for assessing anxiety-like behaviors in this primate and, as
such, constitutes a unique opportunity for direct comparative studies between
rodents and marmoset monkeys in terms of anxiety and/or sedation.

BACKGROUND: Common marmosets are widely used as experimental primates; however,
little is still known about their bone physiology. Therefore, the aim of our
study was to analyse body weight, age and bone-specific blood parameters in
relation to morphological bone parameters.
METHODS: Fifty-eight common marmosets were analysed for blood calcium (Ca),
inorganic phosphor (P(i) ), alkaline phosphatase (AP) and 17-β-estradiol (E2).
The examination of bone parameters was undertaken in the lumbar spine by computer
tomography.
RESULTS: There was a correlation between bone mineral density (BMD) and body
weight, trabecular area ratio and polar moment as well as between BMD and AP or
Ca (only males), whereas there were no correlations between BMD and age, P(i) or 
E2 in all analysed genders.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data support the assumption that the common marmoset is a
reliable primate model to study changes in bone metabolism because of the
similarity of our results to humans.

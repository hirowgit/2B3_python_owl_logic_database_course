BACKGROUND: Chronic recordings with multi-electrode arrays are widely used to
study neural networks underlying complex primate behaviors. Most of these systems
are designed for studying neural activity in the cortical hemispheres resulting
in a lack of devices being capable of simultaneously recording from ensembles of 
neurons in deep brainstem structures. However, to fully understand complex
behavior, it is fundamental to also decipher the intrinsic mechanisms of the
underlying motor pattern generating circuits in the brainstem.
NEW METHOD: We report a light-weight system that simultaneously measures
single-unit activity from a large number of recording sites in the brainstem of
marmoset monkeys. It includes a base chamber fixed to the animal's skull and a
removable upper chamber that can be semi-chronically mounted to the base chamber 
to flexibly position an embedded micro-drive containing a 32-channel laminar
probe to record from various positions within the brainstem for several weeks.
RESULTS: The current system is capable of simultaneously recording stable
single-unit activity from a large number of recording sites in the brainstem of
vocalizing marmoset monkeys.
COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: To the best of our knowledge, chronic systems
to record from deep brainstem structures with multi-site laminar probes in awake,
behaving monkeys do not yet exist.
CONCLUSIONS: The semi-chronic implantation of laminar electrodes into the
brainstem of behaving marmoset monkeys opens new research possibilities in fully 
understanding the neural mechanisms underlying complex behaviors in marmoset
monkeys.

BACKGROUND: Congenital fused labia (CFL) is defined as a failure or significant
delay in the opening of the juvenile sealed labia majora. This phenotype is known
to be variably common in adult captive female marmosets but has never been
investigated in detail before.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Here, we define, describe and quantify the variations in
the degree of closure of the vulva in 122 captive marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) 
from 1.2 to 42 months old and include colony analysis.
RESULTS: There was a negative correlation between the degree of labial fusion and
animal age after prepubertal period (P < 0.05). CFL females had higher number CFL
relatives (4.3 ± 0.6 vs 2.4 ± 0.5 for non-CFL, P < 0.05) and more external
ancestors compared to non-CFL (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results therefore suggest that CFL phenotype is most likely
associated with epigenetic effects induced by the captive environment and colony 
management strategy of extensive crossing of family lines to promote
heterozygosity.

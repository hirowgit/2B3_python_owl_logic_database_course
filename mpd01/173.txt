Pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), embryonic stem cells (ESCs), and induced PSCs
(iPSCs) are excellent tools for studying embryonic development in organisms and
classified into naïve and primed states. ESC-derived germline chimera individuals
can be produced by injecting naïve ESCs/iPSCs into preimplantation embryos, and
conversion of primed human ESCs/iPSCs into a naïve state provides insights into
epiblast cell features. Non-human ESCs/iPSCs are alternatives to human naïve
ESCs/iPSCs, which elicit ethical issues. In this study, we used the common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) as an animal model. Since 1996, 16 marmoset ESC
lines have been established. Because most of these ESC lines are female and were 
derived >10 years ago, new ESCs, particularly male marmoset ESC lines, are
needed. Here, we successfully established 17 novel marmoset ESC lines, including 
six male ESC lines from in vitro-fertilized (IVF) embryos and 12 ESC lines under 
feeder-free conditions. This report is the first to establish ESC lines using
feeder-free conditions and IVF preimplantation blastocysts in marmosets, and
these novel ESC lines could potentially facilitate future non-human primate ESC
studies.

Genetic modification of nonhuman primate (NHP) zygotes is a useful method for the
development of NHP models of human diseases. This review summarizes the recent
advances in the development of assisted reproductive and genetic manipulation
techniques in NHP, providing the basis for the generation of genetically modified
NHP disease models. In this study, we review assisted reproductive techniques,
including ovarian stimulation, in vitro maturation of oocytes, in vitro
fertilization, embryo culture, embryo transfer, and intracytoplasmic sperm
injection protocols in marmosets. Furthermore, we review genetic manipulation
techniques, including transgenic strategies, target gene knock-out and knock-in
using gene editing protocols, and newly developed gene-editing approaches that
may potentially impact the production of genetically manipulated NHP models. We
further discuss the progress of assisted reproductive and genetic manipulation
techniques in NHP; future prospects on genetically modified NHP models for
biomedical research are also highlighted.

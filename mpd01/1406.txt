Six Gram-positive-staining, microaerophilic, non-spore-forming,
fructose-6-phosphate phosphoketolase-positive bacterial strains with a peculiar
morphology were isolated from faecal samples of baby common marmosets (Callithrix
jacchus). Cells of these strains showed a morphology not reported previously for 
a bifidobacterial species, which resembled a coiled snake, always coiled or ring 
shaped or forming a 'Y' shape. Strains MRM 3/1(T) and MRM 4/2 were chosen as
representative strains and characterized further. The bacteria utilized a wide
range of carbohydrates and produced urease. Glucose was fermented to acetate and 
lactate. Strain MRM 3/1(T) showed a peptidoglycan type unique among members of
the genus Bifidobacterium. The DNA base composition was 64.7 mol% G+C.
Almost-complete 16S rRNA, hsp60, clpC and rpoB gene sequences were obtained and
phylogenetic relationships were determined. Comparative analysis of 16S rRNA gene
sequences showed that strains MRM 3/1(T) and MRM 4/2 had the highest similarities
to Bifidobacterium scardovii DSM 13734(T) (94.6%) and Bifidobacterium
stellenboschense DSM 23968(T) (94.5%). Analysis of hsp60 showed that both strains
were closely related to B. stellenboschense DSM 23968(T) (97.5% similarity);
however, despite this high degree of similarity, our isolates could be
distinguished from B. stellenboschense DSM 23968(T) by low levels of DNA-DNA
relatedness (30.4% with MRM 3/1(T)). Strains MRM 3/1(T) and MRM 4/2 were located 
in an actinobacterial cluster and were more closely related to the genus
Bifidobacterium than to other genera in the family Bifidobacteriaceae. On the
basis of these results, strains MRM 3/1(T) and MRM 4/2 represent a novel species 
within the genus Bifidobacterium, for which the name Bifidobacterium aesculapii
sp. nov. is proposed; the type strain is MRM 3/1(T) ( = DSM 26737(T) = JCM
18761(T)).

The palmaris longus is considered a phylogenetic degenerate metacarpophalangeal
joint flexor muscle in humans, a small vestigial forearm muscle; it is the most
variable muscle in humans, showing variation in position, duplication, slips and 
could be reverted. It is frequently studied in papers about human anatomical
variations in cadavers and in vivo, its variation has importance in medical
clinic, surgery, radiological analysis, in studies about high-performance
athletes, in genetics and anthropologic studies. Most studies about palmaris
longus in humans are associated to frequency or case studies, but comparative
anatomy in primates and comparative morphometry were not found in scientific
literature. Comparative anatomy associated to morphometry of palmaris longus
could explain the degeneration observed in this muscle in two of three of the
great apes. Hypothetically, the comparison of the relative length of tendons and 
belly could indicate the pathway of the degeneration of this muscle, that is, the
degeneration could be associated to increased tendon length and decreased belly
from more primitive primates to those most derivate, that is, great apes to
modern humans. In conclusion, in primates, the tendon of the palmaris longus
increase from Lemuriformes to modern humans, that is, from arboreal to
terrestrial primates and the muscle became weaker and tending to be missing.

1. A cDNA encoding novel cytochrome P450 (P450) 4A enzyme was cloned from
marmoset livers by reverse transcription (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
based on the marmoset genome sequences. The amino acid sequence deduced from P450
4A11 cDNA contained consensus sequences of six substrate recognition sites and
one heme-binding domain. 2. Marmoset P450 4A11, highly identical (85-88%) to
cynomolgus monkey and human P450 4A enzymes, was grouped into the same cluster as
cynomolgus monkey and human P450 4A enzymes by phylogenetic analysis. 3. The
tissue distribution analyses by real-time RT PCR and immunoblotting demonstrated 
that marmoset P450 4A11 mRNA and proteins were expressed in kidneys and livers.
Marmoset P450 4A11 enzyme heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli
preferentially catalyzed the ω-hydroxylation of arachidonic acid and lauric acid,
similar to cynomolgus monkey and human P450 4A11 enzymes. However, lauric acid
ω-hydroxylation activity of marmoset P450 4A11 was low compared with those of
marmoset liver microsomes. 4. These results indicated that novel marmoset P450
4A11 was also a fatty acid ω-hydroxylase expressed in kidneys and livers, with
the same regioselectivity (at ω-position of fatty acid) as cynomolgus monkey and 
human P450 4A enzymes.

The efficiency of most of the new antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) on clinical trials
still falls short the success reported in pre-clinical studies, possibly because 
the validity of the animal models is insufficient to fully represent the human
pathology. To improve the translational value for testing AEDs, we propose the
use of non-human primates. Here, we suggest that triggering limbic seizures with 
low doses of PTZ in pilocarpine-treated marmosets might provide a more effective 
basis for the development of AED. Marmosets with epileptic background were more
susceptible to seizures induced by PTZ, which were at least 3 times longer and
more severe (about 6 times greater frequency of generalized seizures) in
comparison to naïve peers. Accordingly, PTZ-induced seizures were remarkably less
attenuated by AEDs in epileptic than naïve marmosets. While phenobarbital
(40mg/kg) virtually abolished seizures regardless of the animal's background,
carbamazepine (120mg/kg) and valproic acid (400mg/kg) could not prevent
PTZ-induced seizures in epileptic animals with the same efficiency as observed in
naïve peers. VPA was less effective regarding the duration of individual seizures
in epileptic animals, as assessed in ECoG (p=0.05). Similarly following CBZ
treatment, the behavioral manifestation of generalized seizures lasted longer in 
epileptic (p<0.05), which were also more frequent than in the naïve group
(p<0.05). As expected, epileptic marmosets experiencing stronger seizures showed 
more NPY- and ΔFosB-immunostained neurons in a number of brain areas associated
with the generation and spread of limbic seizures. Our results suggest that PTZ
induced seizures over an already existing epileptic background constitutes a
reliable and controllable mean for the screening of new AEDs.

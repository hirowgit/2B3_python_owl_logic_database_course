OBJECTIVE: In adult female rodents, ovarian estradiol (E2) regulates body weight,
adiposity, energy balance, physical activity, glucose-insulin homeodynamics, and 
lipid metabolism, while protecting against diet-induced obesity. The same E2
actions are presumed to occur in primates, but confirmatory studies have been
lacking.
METHODS: We investigated the consequences of ovariectomy (OVX) and E2 replacement
in female marmoset monkeys on major metabolic and morphometric endpoints. Sexual 
behavior and uterine diameters were assessed as positive controls for E2
treatment efficacy. Metabolic parameters were measured 1 mo prior to OVX, and 3
and 6 mo thereafter. During OVX, animals received empty or E2-containing silastic
s.c. implants. To test the interaction between E2 and diet, both treatment groups
were assigned to either a higher fat diet (HFD) or a low-fat diet (LFD).
RESULTS: As anticipated, OVX animals exhibited diminished frequency (p = 0.04) of
sexually receptive behavior and increased rejection behavior (p = 0.04) toward
their male partners compared with E2-treated OVX females. OVX also decreased
(p = 0.01) uterine diameter. There were no treatment effects on total caloric
intake. There were no significant effects of OVX, E2 treatment, or diet on body
weight, body composition, energy expenditure, physical activity, fasting glucose,
or glucose tolerance. Regardless of E2 treatment, serum triglycerides were higher
(p = 0.05) in HFD than LFD females. Postmortem qPCR analysis of hypothalamic
tissues revealed higher mRNA expression (p < 0.001) for PGR in E2-treated monkeys
versus OVX controls regardless of diet, but no differences between groups in
other selected metabolic genes. In contrast, regardless of E2 treatment, there
was a decreased mRNA expression of PGC1α (PPARGC1A), HTR1A, and HTR5A in HFD
compared with LFD females.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings, overall, document a greatly diminished role for
ovarian E2 in the metabolic physiology of a female primate, and encourage
consideration that primates, including humans, evolved metabolic control systems 
regulated by extra-ovarian E2 or are generally less subject to E2 regulation.

The integration of multiple sensory modalities is a key aspect of brain function,
allowing animals to take advantage of concurrent sources of information to make
more accurate perceptual judgments. For many years, multisensory integration in
the cerebral cortex was deemed to occur only in high-level "polysensory"
association areas. However, more recent studies have suggested that cross-modal
stimulation can also influence neural activity in areas traditionally considered 
to be unimodal. In particular, several human neuroimaging studies have reported
that extrastriate areas involved in visual motion perception are also activated
by auditory motion, and may integrate audiovisual motion cues. However, the exact
nature and extent of the effects of auditory motion on the visual cortex have not
been studied at the single neuron level. We recorded the spiking activity of
neurons in the middle temporal (MT) and medial superior temporal (MST) areas of
anesthetized marmoset monkeys upon presentation of unimodal stimuli (moving
auditory or visual patterns), as well as bimodal stimuli (concurrent audiovisual 
motion). Despite robust, direction selective responses to visual motion, none of 
the sampled neurons responded to auditory motion stimuli. Moreover, concurrent
moving auditory stimuli had no significant effect on the ability of single MT and
MST neurons, or populations of simultaneously recorded neurons, to discriminate
the direction of motion of visual stimuli (moving random dot patterns with
varying levels of motion noise). Our findings do not support the hypothesis that 
direct interactions between MT, MST and areas low in the hierarchy of auditory
areas underlie audiovisual motion integration.

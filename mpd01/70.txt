Adeno-associated virus 6 (AAV6) has been proposed as a potential vector candidate
for specific gene expression in pain-related dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, 
but this has not been confirmed in nonhuman primates. The aim of our study was to
analyze the transduction efficiency and target specificity of this viral vector
in the common marmoset by comparing it with those in the rat. When green
fluorescent protein-expressing serotype-6 vector was injected into the sciatic
nerve, the efficiency of gene expression in DRG neurons was comparable in both
species. We found that the serotype-6 vector was largely specific to the
pain-related ganglion neurons in the marmoset, as well as in the rat, whereas the
serotype-9 vector resulted in contrasting effects in the two species. Neither
AAV6 nor AAV9 resulted in DRG toxicity when administered via the sciatic nerve,
suggesting this as a safer route of sensory nerve transduction than the currently
used intrathecal or intravenous administrative routes. Furthermore, the AAV6
vector could be an optimal serotype for gene therapy for human chronic pain that 
has a minimal effect on other somatosensory functions of DRG neurons.

PURPOSE: Antagonising serotonin (5-HT) type 2A receptors (5-HT2AR) is an
effective strategy to alleviate both dyskinesia and psychosis in Parkinson's
disease (PD). We have recently shown that activation of metabotropic glutamate 2 
receptors (mGluR2), via either orthosteric stimulation or positive allosteric
modulation, enhances the anti-dyskinetic and anti-psychotic effects of 5-HT2AR
antagonism. Here, we investigated if greater therapeutic efficacy would be
achieved by combining 5-HT2AR antagonism with concurrent mGluR2 orthosteric
stimulation and mGluR2 positive allosteric modulation.
METHODS: Five 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-lesioned
marmosets exhibiting dyskinesia and psychosis-like behaviours (PLBs) were
administered L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) in combination with vehicle or
the 5-HT2AR antagonist EMD-281,014. EMD-281,014 was itself administered alone or 
with the mGluR2 orthosteric agonist (OA) LY-354,740, the mGluR2 positive
allosteric modulator (PAM) LY-487,379 and combination thereof, after which the
severity of dyskinesia, PLBs and parkinsonism was rated.
RESULTS: EMD-281,014 reduced dyskinesia and PLBs by up to 47% and 40%,
respectively (both P < 0.001). The addition of LY-354,740, LY-487,379 and
LY-354,740/LY-487,379 decreased dyskinesia by 56%, 65% and 77%, while PLBs were
diminished by 55%, 63% and 71% (all P < 0.001). All treatment combinations
provided anti-dyskinetic and anti-psychotic benefits significantly greater than
those conferred by EMD-281,014 alone (all P < 0.05). The combination of
EMD-281,014/LY-354,740/LY-487,379 resulted in anti-dyskinetic and anti-psychotic 
effects significantly greater than those conferred by EMD-281,014 with either
LY-354,740 or LY-487,379 (both P < 0.05). No deleterious effects on L-DOPA
anti-parkinsonian action were observed.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that combining 5-HT2AR antagonism with mGluR2
activation results in greater reduction of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia and PD
psychosis. They also indicate that further additive effect can be achieved when a
mGluR2 OA and a mGluR2 PAM are combined with a 5-HT2AR antagonist than when a
mGluR2 OA or a mGluR2 PAM are added to a 5-HT2AR antagonist.

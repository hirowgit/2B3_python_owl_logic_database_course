BACKGROUND: This study evaluated the presence of rotavirus groups A, B, and C
(RV-A, RV-B, and RV-C), sapovirus (SaV), and norovirus (NoV) in asymptomatic
non-human primates (NHP).
METHODS: Fecal samples were collected from 19 recently captured (Red-howler,
Alouatta guariba clamitans, n = 18; Howler, Alouatta caraya, n = 1) and 43
free-ranging NHP (Marmosets, Callithrix spp., Callithrix penicillata, n = 30;
Black-faced lion tamarin, Leontopithecus caissara, n = 12, Red-howler, Alouatta
guariba clamitans, n = 1) that were maintained in southern Brazil without
manifestation of diarrhea. Screening was performed by a combination of
silver-stained polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (ss-PAGE) and RT-PCR analyses.
RESULTS: All samples were negative for RV-A, RV-B, RV-C, SaV, and NoV by both
assays.
CONCLUSION: The negative results obtained might be due to the absence of clinical
manifestations of disease in the population of NHP evaluated.

BACKGROUND: The rhesus enteric caliciviruses (ReCVs) were recently described.
METHODS: Prevalence of ReCV antibodies was tested in six species of captive
non-human primates.
RESULTS: High ReCV seroprevalence was revealed in rhesus and cynomolgus macaques.
CONCLUSIONS: High rates of ReCV seroprevalence and diarrhea in juvenile macaques 
suggest that ReCVs may play a role in morbidity.

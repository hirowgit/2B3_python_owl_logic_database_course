Callimico goeldii (Goeldi's marmoset) is a neotropical primate with 2n = 47,X1X2Y
in the male, and 2n = 48,X1X1X2X2 in the female, due to a Y-autosome
translocation. Karyological comparisons of Callimico, Callithrix jacchus and
Cebus apella suggest that Callimico is a member of the Callitrichidae. Isozyme
data and restriction mapping of LINE-1 repetitive elements in these species and
in a variety of other neotropical primates confirm these findings and supply
strong evidence for including Callimico in the Callitrichidae.

Long-term recordings of the free-running circadian activity rhythm in common
marmosets, Callithrix j. jacchus, living under constant environmental conditions 
(LL 200-470 lx) provided evidence of rhythm splitting in nonhuman primates. In
two out of ten test animals two different types of splitting occurred;
spontaneous persistent splitting and temporary splitting. Neither a reduction of 
the illumination intensity nor the application of dark pulses had any effect on
the two activity components of the persistently split rhythm.

Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating condition with no established
treatment. To better understand the pathology and develop a treatment modality
for SCI, an understanding of the physiological changes following SCI at the
molecular level is essential. However, studies on SCI have primarily used rodent 
models, and few studies have examined SCI in non-human primates. In this study,
we analyzed the temporal changes in gene expression patterns following SCI in
common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) using microarray analysis and mRNA deep
sequencing. This analysis revealed that, although the sequence of events is
comparable between primates and rodents, the inflammatory response following SCI 
is significantly prolonged and the onset of glial scar formation is temporally
delayed in primates compared with rodents. These observations indicate that the
optimal time window to treat SCI significantly differs among different species.
This study provides the first extensive analysis of gene expression following SCI
in non-human primates and will serve as a valuable resource in understanding the 
pathology of SCI.

Schizophrenia is associated with upregulation of dopamine (DA) release in the
caudate nucleus. The caudate has dense connections with the orbitofrontal cortex 
(OFC) via the frontostriatal loops, and both areas exhibit pathophysiological
change in schizophrenia. Despite evidence that abnormalities in dopaminergic
neurotransmission and prefrontal cortex function co-occur in schizophrenia, the
influence of OFC DA on caudate DA and reinforcement processing is poorly
understood. To test the hypothesis that OFC dopaminergic dysfunction disrupts
caudate dopamine function, we selectively depleted dopamine from the OFC of
marmoset monkeys and measured striatal extracellular dopamine levels (using
microdialysis) and dopamine D2/D3 receptor binding (using positron emission
tomography), while modeling reinforcement-related behavior in a discrimination
learning paradigm. OFC dopamine depletion caused an increase in tonic dopamine
levels in the caudate nucleus and a corresponding reduction in D2/D3 receptor
binding. Computational modeling of behavior showed that the lesion increased
response exploration, reducing the tendency to persist with a recently chosen
response side. This effect is akin to increased response switching previously
seen in schizophrenia and was correlated with striatal but not OFC D2/D3 receptor
binding. These results demonstrate that OFC dopamine depletion is sufficient to
induce striatal hyperdopaminergia and changes in reinforcement learning relevant 
to schizophrenia.

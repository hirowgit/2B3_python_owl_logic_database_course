PURPOSE: To assess the use of visual evoked potentials (VEPs) for the in vivo
detection of impaired visual function in a marmoset model of multiple sclerosis. 
The sensitivity of the VEP recordings was determined by comparison with magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) and histopathology.
METHODS: Baseline VEPs were recorded in six healthy marmoset monkeys in response 
to light-flash stimulation. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) was
induced in four of the six monkeys. Clinical scores were assessed daily, and VEPs
were recorded every second week. In vivo MRI and subsequent histopathology of the
brains and optic nerves were performed at the end of the study.
RESULTS: After induction of EAE, all four marmosets exhibited clinical signs
between day 26 and 38 after immunization. VEPs were normal during the induction
phase of the disease, but deteriorated in amplitude with the occurrence of
clinical symptoms in all animals. MRI revealed bilateral optic neuritis and
signal alterations in the optic tracts and occipital subcortical white matter in 
two of the animals. In the remaining two animals, MRI detected signal alterations
in the occipital subcortical white matter. Histopathologic results were
concordant with the MRI findings.
CONCLUSIONS: VEPs are an easily accessible noninvasive tool for measuring visual 
function and diagnosing impairment of the visual pathway in a marmoset EAE model.

Marmoset experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) has previously been
shown to replicate the essential features of both white matter and grey matter
lesions of MS. This study set out to investigate whether cortical atrophy occurs 
in marmoset EAE and whether cortical thinning is related to the presence of
focal, demyelinated cortical lesions. Seventeen leucocortical lesions and 13
subpial lesions were identified in 6 EAE cases. Cortical thickness surrounding
these lesions was recorded and compared with matched cortical areas from five
control animals. We found a diffuse 13-21% loss of cortical thickness in all
areas of EAE cortex compared with control animals but there was no additional
loss seen in demyelinated versus myelinated EAE cortex. These findings could not 
be accounted for by effects of age, sex and disease duration. We conclude that
localised cortical demyelination is not responsible for the major part of the
atrophy observed and that cortical thinning is largely due to more diffuse or
more remote factors. Marmoset EAE is an invaluable tool which can be used to
further investigate the cause and the substrate of cortical loss in demyelinating
diseases.

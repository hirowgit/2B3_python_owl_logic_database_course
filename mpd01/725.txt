The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) represents a promising nonhuman primate 
model for the study of human diseases because of its small size, ease of
handling, and availability of gene-modified animals. Here, we aimed to devise
reproductive technology for marmoset spermatid injection using immature males for
a possible rapid generational turnover. Spermatids at each step could be
identified easily by their morphology under differential interference microscopy:
thus, early round spermatids had a round nucleus with a few nucleolus-like
structures and abundant cytoplasm, as in other mammals. The spermatids acquired
oocyte-activating capacity at the late round spermatid stage, as confirmed by the
resumption of meiosis and Ca2+ oscillations upon injection into mouse oocytes.
The spermatids could be cryopreserved efficiently with a simple medium containing
glycerol and CELL BANKER®. Late round or elongated spermatids first appeared at
10-12 months of age, 6-8 months before sexual maturation. Marmoset oocytes
microinjected with frozen-thawed late round or elongated spermatids retrieved
from a 12-month-old male marmoset developed to the 8-cell stage without the need 
for artificial oocyte activation stimulation. Thus, it might be possible to
shorten the intergeneration time by spermatid injection, from 2 years (by natural
mating) to 13-15 months including gestation.

Objectives In order to facilitate the study of vocalizations in emerging genetic 
common marmoset models of neurodegenerative disorders, we aimed to analyze
call-type changes across age in a translational research environment. We
hypothesized that acoustic parameters of vocalizations would change with age,
reflecting growth of the vocal apparatus and a maturation of control needed to
make adult-like calls. Methods Nineteen developing common marmosets were
longitudinally video- and audio-recorded between the ages of 1-149 days in a
naturalistic setting without any vocalization elicitation protocol. Vocalizations
were coded for call type (cry, tsik, trill, phee, and trill-phee) and analyzed
for duration (sec), minimum and maximum frequency (Hz), and bandwidth (Hz). Mixed
model linear regressions were performed to assess the effects of age on call
parameters listed above for each call type. Results Cries decreased in duration
(P = 0.038), maximum frequency (P = 0.047), and bandwidth (P = 0.023) with age.
Tsik calls decreased in duration (P = 0.002) and increased in minimum frequency
(P = 0.004) and maximum frequency (P = 0.005) with age. Trill calls increased in 
duration (P = 0.003), and trillphee bandwidth (P = 0.031) decreased with age.
Discussion Our results demonstrate that development of common marmoset
vocalizations is call type dependent and that changes in acoustic parameters can 
be detected without complex vocalization elicitation paradigms or specialized
audio recording equipment. Thus, we demonstrate the feasibility of a naturalistic
protocol to collect and objectively analyze marmoset vocalizations
longitudinally. This approach may be useful for studying vocal communication
deficits in genetic models of neurodegenerative disorders.

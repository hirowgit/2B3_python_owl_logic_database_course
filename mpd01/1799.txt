BACKGROUND: Current knowledge about the optimal energy and nutrient supply for
common marmoset monkeys (Callithrix jacchus) is scarce, and more information is
needed for establishing the underlying nutritional concepts for facilitating
longevity of this species as laboratory animals for biomedical research.
METHODS: Two feeding experiments were conducted to yield fundamental data about
feed acceptance, real feed intake, and feed preferences under laboratory
conditions. Newly developed feeding concepts for marmoset monkeys were also
examined in preliminary investigations to compare the outcomes with those of a
commercial pelletized mixed feed.
RESULTS: The first experiments showed preferences for main protein sources in the
diets studied, specifically that plant proteins are more accepted than fish meal 
or egg protein as the main protein source. Several aroma supplements did not
modify the acceptance and feed intake markedly.
CONCLUSIONS: The newly developed feeding concept yielded promising preliminary
data for long-term studies of energy and nutrient supply under laboratory
conditions. However, studies of the fundamental requirements are still needed.

Pregnancy and lactation produce a plethora of hormonal changes in females that
promote maternal care of offspring. Males in the biparental marmoset species
(Callithrix jacchus) demonstrate high levels of parenting behaviour and express
enhanced circulating reproductive hormones. Furthermore, these hormonal changes
are influenced by paternal experience. To determine whether the paternally
experienced male marmoset has altered neurocrine hypothalamic release, as the
maternal females does, we examined the release of several reproductive
neurocrines, dopamine (DA), oxytocin (OT), vasopressin (AVP) and prolactin (PRL),
in cultured explants of the hypothalamus of paternally experienced male marmosets
compared to naïve, paternally inexperienced males. DA levels secreted from the
isolated hypothalamus were significantly lower in the experienced males, whereas 
OT and PRL levels were significantly higher than levels found in inexperienced
males. PRL levels decreased rapidly in the hypothalamic media, suggesting that
PRL production occurs elsewhere. AVP levels did not change. Stimulation of the
cultured explants with oestradiol significantly decreased DA levels in the
inexperienced males but did not alter the other neurocrines, suggesting a direct 
effect of oestradiol on DA suppression in the hypothalamus. Although other
factors such as age and rearing experience with siblings may play a role in
hypothalamic neurocrine levels, these results demonstrate that paternal
experience may impact upon the secretion of neurocrines in a male biparental
primate.

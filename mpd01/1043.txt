BACKGROUND: Sexual differentiation in female mammals can be altered by the
proximity of male littermates in utero, a phenomenon known as the intrauterine
position effect (IUP). Among simian primates, callitrichines (marmosets and
tamarins) are likely candidates for IUP, since they exhibit obligate dizygotic
twinning and fetuses share extensive vascularization in utero. In this paper, we 
determined whether female reproductive parameters are altered by gestating with a
male twin and evaluated changes in genes associated with anti-Müllerian and
steroid hormones in twinning callitrichine primates.
METHODS: We assessed the impact of gestation with male cotwins on reproductive
performance and survivorship in female marmosets (Callithrix) and lion tamarins
(Leontopithecus), contrasting measures for females gestated with one or more
littermates (M+) or no male littermates (0M). We compared targeted coding regions
for genes involved in steroidal and anti-Müllerian hormone mediation of sexual
differentiation for representatives of twinning callitrichines (Callithrix,
Saguinus, and Leontopithecus) with closely related New World primates that
produce single births (Saimiri and Callimico).
RESULTS: IUP effects in females were absent in female callitrichine primates: age
at first ovulation, average litter size, and the proportion of stillborn infants,
and lifetime survivorship did not differ between M+ and 0M females. We documented
multiple nonsynonymous substitutions in genes associated with steroid synthesis, 
transport, and cellular action (SRD5A2, CYP19A1, SHBG, and AR) and with
anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH and AMHR2) in callitrichines. In the only
callitrichine to produce single infants (Callimico), two genes contained
nonsynonymous substitutions relative to twinning callitrichines (CYP19A1 and
AMRHR2); these substitutions were identical with nontwinning Saimiri and humans, 
suggesting a reversion to an ancestral sequence.
CONCLUSIONS: In spite of a shared placental vasculature with opposite-sex twins
throughout embryonic and fetal development, female callitrichine primates
gestated with a male cotwin exhibit no decrement in reproductive performance
relative to females gestated with female cotwins. Hence, IUP effects on female
reproduction in callitrichines are modest. We have identified mutations in
candidate genes relevant for steroid hormone signaling and metabolism, and
especially in AMH-related genes, that are likely to alter protein structure and
function in the callitrichines. These mutations may confer protection for females
from the masculinizing and defeminizing influences of gestating with a male
cotwin.

Vocal production is the result of interacting cognitive and autonomic processes. 
Despite claims that changes in one interoceptive state (arousal) govern primate
vocalizations, we know very little about how it influences their likelihood and
timing. In this study we investigated the role of arousal during naturally
occurring vocal production in marmoset monkeys. Throughout each session,
naturally occurring contact calls are produced more quickly, and with greater
probability, during higher levels of arousal, as measured by heart rate. On
average, we observed a steady increase in heart rate 23 s before the production
of a call. Following call production, there is a sharp and steep cardiac
deceleration lasting ∼8 s. The dynamics of cardiac fluctuations around a
vocalization cannot be completely predicted by the animal's respiration or
movement. Moreover, the timing of vocal production was tightly correlated to the 
phase of a 0.1-Hz autonomic nervous system rhythm known as the Mayer wave.
Finally, a compilation of the state space of arousal dynamics during vocalization
illustrated that perturbations to the resting state space increase the likelihood
of a call occurring. Together, these data suggest that arousal dynamics are
critical for spontaneous primate vocal production, not only as a robust predictor
of the likelihood of vocal onset but also as scaffolding on which behavior can
unfold.

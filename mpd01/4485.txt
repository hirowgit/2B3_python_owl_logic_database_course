We have studied the morphology of the anatomical structures that permit
communication between the anterior chamber and the sinus venosus sclerae.
Examination of the posterior or inner wall of this canal, represented by the
sclerocorneal trabecula, in 15 species of primates and 5 adult humans, has
enabled us to observe the existence of some small orifices or stomata that are
the outermost part of the so-called Sondermann's canals, which in our opinion are
made by the successive confluence of the interstices worked in the interior of
the sclerocorneal trabecula by means of contraction of the longitudinal portion
of the ciliary muscle.

Data are presented on the normal intra- and inter-litter variability of the
embryonic stages in the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) on day 56 of
pregnancy. The embryology of the marmoset is described with respect to the
susceptible period for the teratogenic action of thalidomide.

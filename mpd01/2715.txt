Recent data suggest that the spleen is a crucial component of the immune system
in the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in marmoset
monkeys. Using immunohistochemistry, we investigated changes in the distribution 
of leukocytes in the spleen associated with clinical symptoms of EAE. Animals
without EAE displayed well-developed T- and B-cell areas, germinal centers and
red pulp. In contrast, a marked depletion of periarteriolar T cells with
preservation of other elements was found in animals with clinical EAE. These
findings suggest that immune responses within the spleen are impaired during a
paralysing inflammatory process in the central nervous system.

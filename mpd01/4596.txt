Ectrodactyly and syndactyly in a common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).

French JM.

This paper describes previously unreported malformations of both fore and hind
feet in a liveborn common marmoset. Ectrodactyly of both fore feet and left hind 
foot and syndactyly of the right hind foot were observed.

Lymphocyte subsets in the young and aging marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).

O'Neill PA, Levy BM.

T lymphocytes were studied in healthy young and old marmosets (Callithrix
jacchus). Data indicate that monoclonal antisera to human T lymphocyte antigens
can be used to identify these cells in marmosets. Total T and suppressor T cells 
were lower in the older group; there were no differences in helper T or in B
cells. Helper/suppressor ratios (T4/T8) were increased in the older group. Thus, 
immune system alternations with aging and/or immune deficiency syndromes may be
studied in this animal model using available reagents.

This study proposes new developmental stages for Callithrix jacchus, using
K-Means algorithm and an artificial neural network-self-organising maps (SOM) as 
computational tools, based on weight and age. Eight developmental stages are
proposed: Infant I, II and III, Juvenile I and II, Sub adult, Young adult and
Older adult. This classification is consistent with the first appearance of
several behavioural and physiological characteristics and thus may have
generality in defining critical developmental periods. It also reveals
differences in male and female development and establishes a stage for the onset 
of the final adult life cycle. This classification is also important to
understanding the biology of the ontogenetic development of common marmosets,
providing new insights for the management and care of captive animals and
improving age estimate indicators when specimens are captured in long term
monitoring of free ranging groups.

Maternal gestational androgen levels in female marmosets (Callithrix geoffroyi)

Maternal hormones can dramatically modify offspring phenotypes via organizational
actions on morphological and behavioral development. In placental mammals, there 
is the possibility that some portion of hormones in maternal circulation may be
derived from fetal origin. We tested the possibility that maternal androgens in
pregnant female marmosets reflected, in part, contributions from male fetuses by 
comparing levels of urinary androgens across pregnancy in females carrying
varying numbers of male offspring. We monitored urinary androgen excretion in 18 
pregnancies from five female white-faced marmosets (Callithrix geoffroyi).
Androgen levels rose significantly in the first trimester of pregnancy, reached a
peak in the middle of the second trimester, and then declined gradually until
parturition. At no point in pregnancy were levels of urinary androgens higher in 
females carrying litters that had 50% or more males than in females carrying
litters that were less than 50% male. Levels of maternal androgens were not
associated with litter size, the number of males in the litter, or with the
proportion of the litter that was male. The high levels of androgen in pregnant
females are therefore likely of strictly maternal origin, and any modification of
fetal growth and development can be considered a 'maternal effect'.

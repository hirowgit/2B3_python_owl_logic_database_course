Animal models of rheumatoid arthritis are important in the elucidation of
etiopathogenic mechanisms of the disease and for the development of promising new
therapies. Species specificity of new biological compounds and their mode of
action preclude safety and efficacy testing in rodent models of disease. Nonhuman
primates (NHP) can fill this niche and provide the only relevant model. Over the 
last two decades models of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) were developed in the
rhesus monkey and the common marmoset. However, NHP are higher-order animals and 
complex sentient beings. So especially in models where pain is an intricate part 
of the disease, analgesia needs to be addressed because of ethical
considerations. In our model, a morphine-based pain relief was used that does not
interfere with the normal development of disease allowing us to evaluate
important mechanistic aspects of the arthritis.

Oxidative stress, regarded as a negative effect of free radicals in vivo, takes
place when organisms suffer from harmful stimuli. Some viruses can induce the
release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in infected cells, which may be closely 
related with their pathogenicity. In this report, chaetocin, a fungal metabolite 
reported to have antimicrobial and cytostatic activity, was studied for its
effect on the activation of latent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in B95-8 cells. We
found that chaetocin remarkably up-regulated EBV lytic transcription and DNA
replication at a low concentration (50 nmol L-1). The activation of latent EBV
was accompanied by an increased cellular ROS level. N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), an
ROS inhibitor, suppressed chaetocin-induced EBV activation. Chaetocin had little 
effect on histone H3K9 methylation, while NAC also significantly reduced H3K9
methylation. These results suggested that chaetocin reactivates latent EBV
primarily via ROS pathways.

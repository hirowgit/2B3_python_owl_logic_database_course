MD-3 is a novel anti-human ICAM-1 monoclonal antibody that induces T cell
tolerance in humanized mice via modulation of dendritic cell differentiation and 
efficiently suppresses the development of collagen-induced arthritis. This effect
has also been observed in xenograft rejection in nonhuman primates, where grafts 
survived for more than 2.5 years following MD-3 administration. Here, we show
that MD-3 can attenuate experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) that was 
induced in common marmoset monkeys by immunization with human myelin
oligodendrocyte glycoproteins. MD-3 administration was initiated 1 week after
immunization and efficiently delayed the development of EAE phenotypes, although 
the disease was not completely prevented. Based on the results of
histopathological examination, MD-3 treatment greatly suppressed total
inflammation with respect to demyelination, as well as T cell and microglial
infiltration in the brain. However, the antibody response against myelin
oligodendrocyte glycoprotein was not suppressed with this treatment protocol.
These observations suggest that the MD-3 antibody has beneficial effects on the
treatment of EAE via the suppression of T cell-mediated cellular responses.

Behavioral flexibility, which allows organisms to adapt their actions in response
to environmental changes, is impaired in a number of neuropsychiatric conditions,
including obsessive-compulsive disorder and addiction. Studies in human subjects 
and monkeys have reported correlations between individual differences in dopamine
D2-type receptor (D2R) levels in the caudate nucleus and performance in a
discrimination reversal task, in which established contingent relationships
between abstract stimuli and rewards (or punishments) are reversed. Global
genetic deletion of the D2R in mice disrupts reversal performance, indicating a
likely causal role for this receptor in supporting flexible behaviors. To
directly examine the specific role of caudate D2-type receptors in reversal
performance, the D2/3/4R agonist quinpirole was infused via chronic indwelling
cannulae into the medial caudate of male and female marmoset monkeys performing a
touchscreen-based serial discrimination reversal task. Given prior evidence for
dose-dependent effects of quinpirole and other dopaminergic drugs, a
full dose-response curve was established. Individually, marmosets displayed
marked differences in behavioral sensitivity to specific doses of intra-caudate
quinpirole. Collectively, they exhibited a behaviorally specific bi-phasic
deficit in reversal learning, being consistently impaired at both relatively low 
and high doses of quinpirole. However, intermediate doses of intra-caudate
quinpirole produced significant improvement in reversal performance. These data
support previous human and monkey neuroimaging studies by providing causal
evidence of a U-shaped function describing how dopamine modulates cognitive
flexibility in the primate striatum.

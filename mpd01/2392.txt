A sequence of acoustic events is perceived either as one continuous sound or as a
stream of temporally discrete sounds (acoustic flutter), depending on the rate at
which the acoustic events repeat. Acoustic flutter is perceived at repetition
rates near or below the lower limit for perceiving pitch, and is akin to the
discrete percepts of visual flicker and tactile flutter caused by the slow
repetition of sensory stimulation. It has been shown that slowly repeating
acoustic events are represented explicitly by stimulus-synchronized neuronal
firing patterns in primary auditory cortex (AI). Here we show that a second
neural code for acoustic flutter exists in the auditory cortex of marmoset
monkeys (Callithrix jacchus), in which the firing rate of a neuron is a monotonic
function of an acoustic event's repetition rate. Whereas many neurons in AI
encode acoustic flutter using a dual temporal/rate representation, we find that
neurons in cortical fields rostral to AI predominantly use a monotonic rate code 
and lack stimulus-synchronized discharges. These findings indicate that the
neural representation of acoustic flutter is transformed along the
caudal-to-rostral axis of auditory cortex.

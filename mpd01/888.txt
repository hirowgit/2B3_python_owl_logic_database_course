Cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) continue to be
identified and with a lack of effective clinical treatment and no preventative
strategies, treatment using convalescent plasma or monoclonal antibodies (mAbs)
is a potential quick route to an intervention. Passive immunotherapy via either
convalescent plasma or mAbs has proven to be effective for other infectious
agents. Following infection with MERS-CoV, common marmosets were treated with
high titer hyperimmune plasma or the mAb m336, at 6 and 48 h post inoculation.
Both treatments reduced signs of clinical disease, but reduction in viral loads
in the respiratory tract were only found in the hyperimmune plasma group. A
decrease in gross pathology was found only in the mAb-treated group, but no
histological differences were observed between treated and control animals. While
both hyperimmune plasma and the m336 treatments reduced the severity of disease
in the common marmoset, neither treatment resulted in full protection against
disease.

Cortical demyelination is a widely recognized hallmark of multiple sclerosis (MS)
and correlate of disease progression and cognitive decline. The pathomechanisms
initiating and driving gray matter damage are only incompletely understood. Here,
we determined the infiltrating leukocyte subpopulations in 26 cortical
demyelinated lesions of biopsied MS patients and assessed their contribution to
cortical lesion formation in a newly developed mouse model. We find that
conformation-specific anti-myelin antibodies contribute to cortical demyelination
even in the absence of the classical complement pathway. T cells and natural
killer cells are relevant for intracortical type 2 but dispensable for subpial
type 3 lesions, whereas CCR2+ monocytes are required for both. Depleting CCR2+
monocytes in marmoset monkeys with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis
using a novel humanized CCR2 targeting antibody translates into significantly
less cortical demyelination and disease severity. We conclude that biologics
depleting CCR2+ monocytes might be attractive candidates for preventing cortical 
lesion formation and ameliorating disease progression in MS.

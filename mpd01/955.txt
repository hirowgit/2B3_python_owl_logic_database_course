Cytogenetics has historically played a key role in research on squirrel monkey
(genus Saimiri) evolutionary biology. Squirrel monkeys have a diploid number of
2n = 44, but vary in fundamental number (FN). Apparently, differences in FN have 
phylogenetic implications and are correlated with geographic regions. A number of
hypothetical mechanisms were proposed to explain difference in FN:
translocations, heterochromatin, or, most commonly, pericentric inversions.
Recently, an additional mechanism, centromere repositioning, was discovered,
which can alter chromosome morphology and FN. Here, we used chromosome banding,
chromosome painting, and BAC-FISH to test these hypotheses. We demonstrate that
centromere repositioning on chromosomes 5 and 15 is the mechanism that accounts
for differences in FN. Current phylogenomic trees of platyrrhines provide a
temporal framework for evolutionary new centromeres (ENC) in Saimiri. The
X-chromosome ENC could be up to 15 million years (my) old that on chromosome 5 as
recent as 0.3 my. The chromosome 15 ENC is intermediate, as young as 2.24 my. All
ENC have abundant satellite DNAs indicating that the maturation process was
fairly rapid. Callithrix jacchus was used as an outgroup for the BAC-FISH data
analysis. Comparison with scaffolds from the S. boliviensis genome revealed an
error in the last marmoset genome release. Future research including at the
sequence level will provide better understanding of chromosome evolution in
Saimiri and other platyrrhines. Probably other cases of differences in chromosome
morphology and FN, both within and between taxa, will be shown to be due to
centromere repositioning and not pericentric inversions.

Humans and nonhuman primates (NHP) are similar in behavior and in physiology,
specifically the structure, function, and complexity of the immune system. Thus, 
NHP models are desirable for pathophysiology and pharmacology/toxicology studies.
Furthermore, NHP-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) may enable
transformative developmental, translational, or evolutionary studies in a field
of inquiry currently hampered by the limited availability of research specimens. 
NHP-iPSCs may address specific questions that can be studied back and forth
between in vitro cellular assays and in vivo experimentations, an investigational
process that in most cases cannot be performed on humans because of safety and
ethical issues. The use of NHP model systems and cell specific in vitro models is
evolving with iPSC-based three-dimensional (3D) cell culture systems and
organoids, which may offer reliable in vitro models and reduce the number of
animals used in experimental research. IPSCs have the potential to give rise to
defined cell types of any organ of the body. However, standards for deriving
defined and validated NHP iPSCs are missing. Standards for deriving high-quality 
iPSC cell lines promote rigorous and replicable scientific research and likewise,
validated cell lines reduce variability and discrepancies in results between
laboratories. We have derived and validated NHP iPSC lines by confirming their
pluripotency and propensity to differentiate into all three germ layers
(ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm) according to standards and measurable limits
for a set of marker genes. The iPSC lines were characterized for their potential 
to generate neural stem cells and to differentiate into dopaminergic neurons.
These iPSC lines are available to the scientific community. NHP-iPSCs fulfill a
unique niche in comparative genomics to understand gene regulatory principles
underlying emergence of human traits, in infectious disease pathogenesis, in
vaccine development, and in immunological barriers in regenerative medicine.

Recent evidence demonstrates that the pulvinar nuclei play a critical role in
shaping the connectivity and function of the multiple cortical areas they
connect. Surprisingly, however, little is known about the development of this
area, the largest corpus of the thalamic nuclei, which go on to occupy 40% of the
adult thalamus in the human. It was proposed that the nonhuman primate and the
human pulvinar develop according to very different processes, with a greatly
reduced neurogenic period in nonhuman primate compared to human and divergent
origins. In the marmoset monkey, we demonstrate that neurons populating the
pulvinar are generated throughout gestation, suggesting that this aspect of
development is more similar to the human than first predicted. While we were able
to confirm the diencephalic source of pulvinar neurons, we provide new evidence
contesting the presence of an additional niche in the telencephalon. Finally, our
study defines new molecular markers that will simplify future investigations in
the development and evolution of the pulvinar.

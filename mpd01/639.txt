The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is uniquely suited for longitudinal
studies of cognitive aging, due to a relatively short lifespan, sophisticated
cognitive abilities, and patterns of brain aging that resemble those of humans.
We examined cognitive function and fine motor skills in male and female marmosets
(mean age ∼5 at study entry) followed longitudinally for 2 years. Each year,
monkeys were tested on a reversal learning task with three pairs of stimuli
(n = 18, 9 females) and a fine motor task requiring them to grasp small rewards
from two staircases (Hill and Valley test, n = 12, 6 females). There was little
evidence for a decline in cognitive flexibility between the two time points, in
part because of practice effects. However, independent of year of testing,
females took longer than males to reach criterion in the reversals, indicating
impaired cognitive flexibility. Motivation was unlikely to contribute to this
effect, as males refused a greater percentage of trials than females in the
reversals. With regards to motor function, females were significantly faster than
males in the Hill and Valley task. From Year 1 to Year 2, a slight slowing of
motor function was observed in both sexes, but accuracy decreased significantly
in males only. This study (1) demonstrates that marmosets exhibit sex differences
in cognitive flexibility and fine motor function that resemble those described in
humans; (2) that changes in fine motor function can already be detected at
middle-age; and (3) that males may experience greater age-related changes in fine
motor skills than females. Additional data points will determine whether these
sex and age differences persist over time.

BACKGROUND: Common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) are potentially useful nonhuman
primate models for preclinical studies. Information for major drug-metabolizing
cytochrome P450 (P450) enzymes is now available that supports the use of this
primate species as an animal model for drug development. Here, we collect and
provide an overview of information on the activities of common marmoset hepatic
and intestinal microsomes with respect to 28 typical human P450 probe oxidations.
RESULTS: Marmoset P450 2D6/8-dependent R-metoprolol O-demethylation activities in
hepatic microsomes were significantly correlated with those of midazolam 1'- and 
4-hydroxylations, testosterone 6β-hydroxylation, and progesterone
6β-hydroxylation, which are probe reactions for marmoset P450 3A4/5/90. In
marmosets, the oxidation activities of hepatic microsomes and intestinal
microsomes were roughly comparable for midazolam and terfenadine. Overall,
multiple forms of marmoset P450 enzymes in livers and intestines had generally
similar substrate recognition functionalities to those of human and/or cynomolgus
monkey P450 enzymes.
CONCLUSION: The marmoset could be a model animal for humans with respect to the
first-pass extraction of terfenadine and related substrates. These findings
provide a foundation for understanding individual pharmacokinetic and
toxicological results in nonhuman primates as preclinical models and will help to
further support understanding of the molecular mechanisms of human P450 function.

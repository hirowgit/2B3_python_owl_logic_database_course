BACKGROUND: Conscious vision is believed to depend upon an intact primary visual 
cortex (V1), although injury in early life is often accompanied by the
preservation of visual capacity, unlike in adulthood. The middle temporal area
(MT) receives input from the retinorecipient koniocellular layers of the lateral 
geniculate nucleus (LGN) and the more recently described medial subdivision of
the inferior pulvinar (PIm) of the thalamus, pathways that potentially contribute
to preservation of vision after early damage to V1.
RESULTS: We examined the potential of these pathways to the long-term
preservation of vision after permanent lesions of primate V1 in early and adult
life by using a combination of neural tracing and diffusion MRI. We show that
early-life V1 lesions lead to less pruning of the retina-pulvinar-MT pathway than
is observed in control or adult lesion animals.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that sustained visual input through the
pulvinar to MT following a lesion of V1 in early life has the capacity to afford 
improved visual outcomes.

Trait anxiety is a risk factor for the development and maintenance of affective
disorders, and insights into the underlying brain mechanisms are vital for
improving treatment and prevention strategies. Translational studies in non-human
primates, where targeted neurochemical and genetic manipulations can be made, are
critical in view of their close neuroanatomical similarity to humans in brain
regions implicated in trait anxiety. Thus, we characterised the serotonergic and 
regional brain volume correlates of trait-like anxiety in the marmoset monkey.
Low- and high-anxious animals were identified by behavioral responses to a human 
intruder (HI) that are known to be sensitive to anxiolytic drug treatment.
Extracellular serotonin levels within the amygdala were measured with in vivo
microdialysis, at baseline and in response to challenge with the selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitor, citalopram. Regional brain volume was assessed by
structural magnetic resonance imaging. Anxious individuals showed persistent,
long-term fearful responses to both a HI and a model snake, alongside sustained
attention (vigilance) to novel cues in a context associated with unpredictable
threat. Neurally, high-anxious marmosets showed reduced amygdala serotonin
levels, and smaller volumes in a closely connected prefrontal region, the dorsal 
anterior cingulate cortex. These findings highlight behavioral and neural
similarities between trait-like anxiety in marmosets and humans, and set the
stage for further investigation of the processes contributing to vulnerability
and resilience to affective disorders.

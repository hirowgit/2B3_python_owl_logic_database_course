Diamine oxidase (DAOX) can be localized in the light microscope using
immunohistochemistry, but a reliable procedure for detecting the activity of the 
enzyme does not exist. A method was thus developed in which cerium ions trap
H2O2, generated by DAOX, and a diaminobenzidine-H2O2-Co sequence serves for the
visualization of the primary reaction product cerium perhydroxide. With this
method and diamine substrates cadaverine or putrescine, or polyamine substrates
spermidine or spermine as substrates, DAOX was localized species-independently
but substrate-dependently in the basolateral cytoplasm and/or plasma membrane of 
small intestinal enterocytes of rats, mice and gerbils. Less, or even no, final
reaction product was seen in these cells of guinea-pigs and marmosets. Colonic
enterocytes were positive for DAOX solely in gerbils. Furthermore,
species-dependent diamine oxidase was present in special cells of the mouse and
guinea-pig kidney, immune organs and liver of rats and gerbils, marmoset placenta
and in decidual cells of the human, rat and mouse placenta.

Gelatin as a vehicle for food and vitamin administration to marmosets.

Pereira LH, Melo AL, Resende DM.

For a period of three years, gelatin was used as a vehicle for administration of 
food, vitamin complex and drugs to laboratory maintained Callithrix penicillata
and Callithrix jacchus marmosets and a breeding colony of C. penicillata. In both
circumstances, results were satisfactory. The animals survived for long periods
of time, with adult, young and juvenile primates in the breeding colony showing
good physical condition.

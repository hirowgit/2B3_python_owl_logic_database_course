Hepatitis A and B: serologic survey of human and nonhuman primate sera.

Eichberg JW, Kalter SS.

Sera of humans and seven species of nonhuman primates were tested by
radioimmunoassay and enzyme immunoassay for the presence of hepatitis A antibody,
hepatitis B surface antigen and antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen. The
outcome of testing a total of 276 serum or plasma specimens was as follows: with 
the exception of squirrel monkeys (0%) and cotton-top marmosets (0%), a
considerable percentage of all other species tested had detectable antibodies to 
hepatitis A virus: humans 45.9%, chimpanzees 36.6%, baboons 38.2%, vervets 57.9%,
cebus monkeys 40.0% and common marmosets 50.0%. Only one human and two
chimpanzees were carriers of hepatitis B surface antigen. Antibodies to hepatitis
B surface antigen were detected in human (11.3%), chimpanzees (29.9%), baboons
(36.2%) and squirrel monkeys (5%). Chimpanzees showed an increasing prevalence of
antibodies to hepatitis A virus and hepatitis B surface antigen with age.

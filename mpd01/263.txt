Altered olfactory function is a common symptom of COVID-19, but its etiology is
unknown. A key question is whether SARS-CoV-2 (CoV-2) - the causal agent in
COVID-19 - affects olfaction directly, by infecting olfactory sensory neurons or 
their targets in the olfactory bulb, or indirectly, through perturbation of
supporting cells. Here we identify cell types in the olfactory epithelium and
olfactory bulb that express SARS-CoV-2 cell entry molecules. Bulk sequencing
demonstrated that mouse, non-human primate and human olfactory mucosa expresses
two key genes involved in CoV-2 entry, ACE2 and TMPRSS2. However, single cell
sequencing revealed that ACE2 is expressed in support cells, stem cells, and
perivascular cells, rather than in neurons. Immunostaining confirmed these
results and revealed pervasive expression of ACE2 protein in dorsally-located
olfactory epithelial sustentacular cells and olfactory bulb pericytes in the
mouse. These findings suggest that CoV-2 infection of non-neuronal cell types
leads to anosmia and related disturbances in odor perception in COVID-19
patients.

BACKGROUND: Ceramides are lipid molecules determining cell integrity and
intercellular signaling, and thus, involved in the pathogenesis of several
psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. However, little is known about the
role of particular enzymes of the ceramide metabolism in the mechanisms of normal
behavioral plasticity. Here, we studied the contribution of neutral ceramidase
(NC), one of the main enzymes mediating ceramide degradation, in the mechanisms
of learning and memory in rats and non-human primates.
METHODS: Naïve Wistar rats and black tufted-ear marmosets (Callithrix
penicillata) were tested in several tests for short- and long-term memory and
then divided into groups with various memory performance. The activities of NC
and acid ceramidase (AC) were measured in these animals. Additionally, anxiety
and depression-like behavior and brain levels of monoamines were assessed in the 
rats.
RESULTS: We observed a predictive role of NC activity in the blood serum for
superior performance of long-term object memory tasks in both species. A brain
area analysis suggested that high NC activity in the ventral mesencephalon (VM)
predicts better short-term memory performance in rats. High NC activity in the VM
was also associated with worse long-term object memory, which might be mediated
by an enhanced depression-like state and a monoaminergic imbalance.
CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, these data suggest a role for NC in short- and long-term
memory of various mammalian species. Serum activity of NC may possess a
predictive role in the assessing the performance of certain types of memory.

1. Roles of human cytochrome P450 (P450) 3A4 in oxidation of an antihistaminic
drug terfenadine have been previously investigated in association with
terfenadine-ketoconazole interaction. Several antihistamine drugs have been
recently identified as substrates for multiple P450 enzymes. In this study,
overall roles of P450 3A4, 2J2, and 4F12 enzymes in terfenadine t-butyl
hydroxylation were investigated in small intestines and livers from humans,
marmosets, and/or cynomolgus monkeys. 2. Human liver microsomes and liver and
small intestine microsomes from marmosets and cynomolgus monkeys effectively
mediated terfenadine t-butyl hydroxylation. Ketoconazole and
N-hydroxy-N'-(4-butyl-2-methylphenyl)-formamidine (a P450 4A/F inhibitor) almost 
completely and moderately inhibited these activities, respectively, in human
liver microsomes; however, these chemicals did not show substantially suppression
in marmoset liver. Anti-human P450 3A and 4F antibodies showed the roughly
supportive inhibitory effects. 3. Recombinant P450 3A4/90 and 4F12 showed high
terfenadine t-butyl hydroxylation activities with substrate inhibition constants 
of 84-144 μM (under 26-76 μM of Km values), in similar manners to liver and
intestine microsomes. 4. These results suggest that human and marmoset P450
3A4/90 and 4F12 in livers or small intestines played important roles in
terfenadine t-butyl hydroxylation. Marmosets could be a model for humans during
first pass extraction of terfenadine and related substrates.

The corpus callosum (CC) is present in all primate brains and is the major white 
matter tract connecting the cerebral hemispheres for integration of sensory,
motor and higher-order cognitive information. The midsagittal area of the CC has 
frequently been used as a sensitive biomarker of brain development. Although the 
marmoset has been considered as an alternative non-human primate model for
neuroscience research, the developmental patterns of the CC have not been
explored. The present longitudinal study of magnetic resonance imaging
demonstrated that marmosets show a rapid increase of CC during infancy, followed 
by a slow increase during the juvenile stage, as observed in chimpanzees and
humans. Marmosets also show a tendency toward a greater increase in CC during
late infancy and the juvenile stage, as observed in humans, but not in
chimpanzees. However, several differences between marmosets and humans were
identified. There was a tendency toward a greater maturation of the human CC
during early infancy. Furthermore, there was a tendency toward a greater increase
during late infancy and the juvenile stage in marmosets, compared to that
observed in chimpanzees and humans. These differences in the developmental
trajectories of the CC may be related to evolutional changes in social behavior.

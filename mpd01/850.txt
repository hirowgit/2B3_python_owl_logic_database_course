Emerging viral infections are difficult to control because heterogeneous members 
periodically cycle in and out of humans and zoonotic hosts, complicating the
development of specific antiviral therapies and vaccines. Coronaviruses (CoVs)
have a proclivity to spread rapidly into new host species causing severe disease.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory
syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) successively emerged, causing severe epidemic respiratory
disease in immunologically naïve human populations throughout the globe.
Broad-spectrum therapies capable of inhibiting CoV infections would address an
immediate unmet medical need and could be invaluable in the treatment of emerging
and endemic CoV infections. We show that a nucleotide prodrug, GS-5734, currently
in clinical development for treatment of Ebola virus disease, can inhibit
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV replication in multiple in vitro systems, including primary
human airway epithelial cell cultures with submicromolar IC50 values. GS-5734 was
also effective against bat CoVs, prepandemic bat CoVs, and circulating
contemporary human CoV in primary human lung cells, thus demonstrating
broad-spectrum anti-CoV activity. In a mouse model of SARS-CoV pathogenesis,
prophylactic and early therapeutic administration of GS-5734 significantly
reduced lung viral load and improved clinical signs of disease as well as
respiratory function. These data provide substantive evidence that GS-5734 may
prove effective against endemic MERS-CoV in the Middle East, circulating human
CoV, and, possibly most importantly, emerging CoV of the future.

The aim of this study was to provide a detailed anatomical description of the
abdomen in the clinically normal common marmoset by means of computed tomography 
(CT). Eight clinically healthy mature common marmosets ranging from 12 to
48 months and 235 to 365 g bodyweight were anesthetized and pre- and
post-contrast CT examinations were performed using different CT settings in
dorsal recumbency. Abdominal organs were identified and visibility noted.
Diagnostic quality abdominal images could be obtained of the common marmoset
despite its small size using a dual-slice CT scanner. Representative
cross-sectional images were chosen from different animals illustrating the
abdominal CT anatomy of clinically normal common marmosets. Identification or
delineation of abdominal organs greatly improved with i.v. contrast. A modified
high-frequency algorithm with edge enhancement added valuable information for
identification of small structures such as the ureters. The Hounsfield unit (HU) 
of major abdominal organs differed from that of small animals (domestic dogs and 
cats). Due to their size and different anatomy, standard small animal CT
protocols need to be critically assessed and adapted for exotics, such as the
common marmoset. The established normal reference range of HU of major abdominal 
organs and adapted settings for a CT protocol will aid clinical assessment of the
common marmoset.

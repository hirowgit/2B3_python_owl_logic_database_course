We describe our connectomics pipeline for processing anterograde tracer injection
data for the brain of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). Brain sections
were imaged using a batch slide scanner (NanoZoomer 2.0-HT) and we used
artificial intelligence to precisely segment the tracer signal from the
background in the fluorescence images. The shape of each brain was reconstructed 
by reference to a block-face and all data were mapped into a common 3D brain
space with atlas and 2D cortical flat map. To overcome the effect of using a
single template atlas to specify cortical boundaries, brains were cyto- and
myelo-architectonically annotated to create individual 3D atlases. Registration
between the individual and common brain cortical boundaries in the flat map space
was done to absorb the variation of each brain and precisely map all tracer
injection data into one cortical brain space. We describe the methodology of our 
pipeline and analyze the accuracy of our tracer segmentation and brain
registration approaches. Results show our pipeline can successfully process and
normalize tracer injection experiments into a common space, making it suitable
for large-scale connectomics studies with a focus on the cerebral cortex.

Whole-organ/body three-dimensional (3D) staining and imaging have been enduring
challenges in histology. By dissecting the complex physicochemical environment of
the staining system, we developed a highly optimized 3D staining imaging pipeline
based on CUBIC. Based on our precise characterization of biological tissues as an
electrolyte gel, we experimentally evaluated broad 3D staining conditions by
using an artificial tissue-mimicking material. The combination of optimized
conditions allows a bottom-up design of a superior 3D staining protocol that can 
uniformly label whole adult mouse brains, an adult marmoset brain hemisphere, an 
~1 cm3 tissue block of a postmortem adult human cerebellum, and an entire infant 
marmoset body with dozens of antibodies and cell-impermeant nuclear stains. The
whole-organ 3D images collected by light-sheet microscopy are used for
computational analyses and whole-organ comparison analysis between species. This 
pipeline, named CUBIC-HistoVIsion, thus offers advanced opportunities for organ- 
and organism-scale histological analysis of multicellular systems.

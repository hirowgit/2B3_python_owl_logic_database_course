BACKGROUND: Non-human primates (NHPs) as a source for Plasmodium infections in
humans are a challenge for malaria elimination. In Brazil, two species of
Plasmodium have been described infecting NHPs, Plasmodium brasilianum and
Plasmodium simium. Both species are infective to man. Plasmodium brasilianum
resembles morphologically, genetically and immunologically the human quartan
Plasmodium malariae. Plasmodium brasilianum naturally infects species of
non-human primates from all New World monkey families from a large geographic
area. In the family Callitrichidae only the genus Saguinus has been described
infected so far. The present study describes the natural infection of P.
brasilianum in tamarins and marmosets of the genera Callithrix, Mico and
Leontopithecus in the Atlantic forest.
METHODS: One hundred and twenty-two NHPs of the family Callitrichidae housed in
the Primate Centre of Rio de Janeiro (CPRJ) were sampled in June 2015, and
January and July 2016. The CPRJ is located in the Atlantic forest in the
Guapimirim municipality, in the Rio de Janeiro state, where human autochthonous
cases of malaria have been reported. The samples were screened for the presence
of Plasmodium using optical microscopy and nested PCR for detection of 18S small 
subunit rRNA gene. The amplicon was sequenced to confirm the molecular diagnosis.
RESULTS: The frequency of Plasmodium infections detected by nested PCR in New
World monkeys of the family Callitrichidae was 6.6%. For the first time,
Callitrichidae primates of genera Callithrix, Mico and Leontopithecus were found 
naturally infected with P. brasilianum. Infection was confirmed by sequencing a
small fragment of 18S rRNA gene, although no parasites were detected in blood
smears.
CONCLUSIONS: The reported P. brasilianum infection in NHP species maintained in
captivity suggests that infection can be favoured by the presence of vectors and 
the proximity between known (and unknown) hosts of malaria. Thus, the list of
potential malaria reservoirs needs to be further explored.

To elucidate the forelimb phylogeny of primates, anatomical analysis of the
brachial plexus in platyrrhines is beneficial. In the present study, six brachial
plexuses and the surrounding arteries of four common marmosets were dissected. In
five specimens, the brachial plexus consisted of five ventral rami from the fifth
cervical nerve (C5) to the first thoracic nerve (T1). In one specimen, the
ventral ramus of the fourth cervical nerve joined with the brachial plexus. In
five specimens, the upper trunk was composed of C5 and the sixth cervical nerve
(C6). In one specimen, the ventral division of C6 merged with the ventral branch 
of the middle trunk to constitute the lateral cord. The seventh cervical nerve
constituted the middle trunk, and the eighth cervical nerve and T1 formed the
lower trunk in all specimens. The lateral cord gave rise to the musculocutaneous 
nerve, and the remaining component merged with the medial cord. The confluence of
the lateral and medial cords immediately bifurcated into the median and ulnar
nerves. These branching patterns of the musculocutaneous, median, and ulnar
nerves were consistent and similar to the human counterparts. In the dorsal
division, the single posterior cord as observed in the human brachial plexus was 
not observed. The axillary artery did not pass between the medial and lateral
roots of the median nerve, and the axillary artery bifurcated into the brachial
artery and the superficial brachial artery. Anat Rec, 300:1299-1306, 2017. © 2017

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating, autoimmune disease of the central
nervous system. While work has focused on myelin and axon loss in MS, less is
known about mechanisms underlying synaptic changes. Using postmortem human MS
tissue, a preclinical nonhuman primate model of MS, and two rodent models of
demyelinating disease, we investigated synapse changes in the visual system.
Similar to other neurodegenerative diseases, microglial synaptic engulfment and
profound synapse loss were observed. In mice, synapse loss occurred independently
of local demyelination and neuronal degeneration but coincided with gliosis and
increased complement component C3, but not C1q, at synapses. Viral overexpression
of the complement inhibitor Crry at C3-bound synapses decreased microglial
engulfment of synapses and protected visual function. These results indicate that
microglia eliminate synapses through the alternative complement cascade in
demyelinating disease and identify a strategy to prevent synapse loss that may be
broadly applicable to other neurodegenerative diseases. VIDEO ABSTRACT.

Treatments for refractory glaucoma include trabeculectomy, in which a filtering
bleb is created to reduce aqueous pressure. Mitomycin C (MMC) is often used as an
adjuvant to reduce post-trabeculectomy bleb scarring and consequent failure.
However, scarring sometimes still occurs. Thus, we searched for more effective
trabeculectomy adjuvants with high-throughput screening (HTS) of a library of
1,165 off-patent drug compounds. This revealed that amsacrine (AMSA), a DNA
topoisomerase II (TOP2) inhibitor, was the top candidate. Compared to MMC,
rabbits that underwent trabeculectomy with 10% AMSA had lower IOP at 42, 56, and 
70 days (P < 0.01 at all measurement points) and a higher bleb score at 28, 42,
56, and 70 days (P =  < 0.01, 0.04, 0.04, and < 0.01, respectively). Compared to 
saline, rabbits that received 1% AMSA also had lower IOP and better bleb score at
all time points, without a sharp drop in IOP just after surgery (all P < 0.01).
Both effects were milder than MMC at 7 days (P = 0.02 and <0.01, respectively).
Thus, this study showed that HTS may help identify new, promising uses for
off-patent drugs. Furthermore, trabeculectomy with AMSA at a suitable
concentration may improve the prognosis after trabeculectomy compared to MMC.

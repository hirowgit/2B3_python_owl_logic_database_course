Current dopamine replacement therapies, in Parkinson's disease (PD), result in
aversive side effects and rapid drug dose escalation over time. Therefore, a
non-dopaminergic treatment would be an advantageous supplement to lower the dose 
of dopamine replacement treatment postponing the occurrence of side effects. The 
noradrenergic system plays an important role in the facilitation or maintenance
of the activity of the nigrostriatal dopamine pathways. Here the putative
anti-Parkinson effects of the oral selective alpha2C-adrenoceptor antagonist
(JNJ27063699 0.1-10mg/kg p.o.) and of vehicle (fruit syrup) were evaluated in the
MPTP-marmoset model. Dose-related anti-Parkinson effects were assessed by means
of a behavioural rating scale covering parkinsonian symptoms, body weight and
body temperature, and two test systems assessing locomotor activity and complex
motor skills of hand-eye coordination for controlled movements in MPTP- or
saline-pretreated marmosets. JNJ27063699, at the middle and higher doses,
consistently improved locomotor activity and hand-eye coordination capabilities, 
which indicates an improvement in the coordination of motor control -or
movements- in MPTP-pretreated monkeys. No additional effects on the parkinsonian 
symptoms or side effects were observed on other test systems. Overall, the
findings link deficit in motor coordination with dysfunctional adrenergic
signalling and it suggest that selective alpha2C adrenergic antagonism may
contribute to behavioural improvement in the MPTP-monkey model of PD. In
multi-drug medication JNJ27063699 might have potential in the treatment of motor 
deficit in PD.

Adaptation of the horizontal vestibulo-ocular reflex (HVOR) provides an
experimental model for cerebellum-dependent motor learning. We developed an eye
movement measuring system and a paradigm for induction of HVOR adaptation for the
common marmoset. The HVOR gain in dark measured by 10° (peak-to-peak amplitude)
and 0.11-0.5Hz turntable oscillation was around unity. The gain-up and gain-down 
HVOR adaptation was induced by 1h of sustained out-of-phase and in-phase
10°-0.33Hz combined turntable-screen oscillation in the light, respectively. To
examine the role of long-term depression (LTD) of parallel fiber-Purkinje cell
synapses, we intraperitonially applied T-588 or nimesulide, which block the
induction of LTD in vitro or in vivo preparations, 1h before the test of HVOR
adaptation. T-588 (3 and 5mg/kg body weight) did not affect nonadapted HVOR
gains, and impaired both gain-up and gain-down HVOR adaptation. Nimesulide (3 and
6mg/kg) did not affect nonadapted HVOR gains, and impaired gain-up HVOR
adaptation dose-dependently; however, it very little affected gain-down HVOR
adaptation. These findings are consistent with the results of our study of
nimesulide on the adaptation of horizontal optokinetic response in mice (Le et
al., 2010), and support the view that LTD underlies HVOR adaptation.

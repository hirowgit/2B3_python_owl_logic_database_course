A comparison of the distribution of brain monoamine neurons in several New World 
and Old World monkeys was undertaken using the Falck-Hillarp formaldehyde
histofluorescence technique. The overall organization of the monoamine neurons
was very similar in all species, although subtle variations were found.
Catecholamine (noradrenaline and dopamine) and indoleamine (serotonin) cell
bodies corresponding to groups A1-A7, A8-A10, and B1-B9, respectively were found 
throughout the brainstem. A few catecholamine (dopamine) cells equivalent to
groups All and A12 in the diencephalon were also observed. Noradrenaline neurons,
rather than those of the dopamine and serotonin systems, tended to be less
numerous in the New World monkeys. Ascending catecholamine and indoleamine fiber 
bundles were observed in most monkeys. It is interesting that fibers
corresponding to the "ventral noradrenaline bundle" appeared to be much finer in 
the common marmoset and tamarin than in other species. In addition, a substantial
catecholamine (noradrenaline) innervation of the diencephalon was noted in all
the Old World monkeys, while a much lower overall terminal density was apparent
in the New World forms.

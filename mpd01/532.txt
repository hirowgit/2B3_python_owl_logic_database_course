The in vitro maturation of oocytes is frequently used as an assisted reproductive
technique (ART), and has been successfully established in humans and rodents. To 
overcome the limitations of ART, novel procedures for the in vitro maturation of 
early follicles are emerging. During the follicle isolation procedure, the
unintended rupture of each follicle leads to a release of extra oocytes. Such
oocytes, which are obtained during follicle isolation from marmosets, can be used
for early maturation studies. Marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), which is classified 
as a new-world monkey, is a novel model that has been employed in reproductive
biomedical research, as its reproductive physiology is similar to that of humans 
in several aspects. The ovaries of female marmosets were collected, and the
excess oocytes present during follicle isolation were retrieved without
pre-gonadotropin induction. Each oocyte was matured in vitro for 48 h in the
presence of various concentrations of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and
epidermal growth factor (EGF), and the maturity of oocytes and optimal maturation
conditions were evaluated. Each oocyte was individually reverse-transcribed, and 
the expression of mRNAs and microRNAs (miRs) were analyzed. Concentrations of hCG
significantly affected the maturation rate of oocytes [the number of metaphase II
(MII) oocytes]. The expression of BMP15 and ZP1 was highest when the oocytes were
matured using 100 IU/L of hCG without pre-treatment with gonadotropins, and that 
of Cja-mir-27a was highest when cultured with follicle stimulating hormone. These
results suggest that these up-regulated miRs affect the maturation of oocytes.
Interactions with other protein networks were analyzed, and a strong association 
of BMP15 and ZP1 with sperm binding receptor (ACR), anti-MÃ¼llerian hormone (AMH),
and AMH receptor was demonstrated, which is related to the proliferation of
granulosa cells. Collectively, on the basis of these results, the authors propose
optimal maturation conditions of excess oocytes of marmoset without in vivo
gonadotropin treatment, and demonstrated the roles of miRs in early oocyte
maturation at the single-cell level in marmosets.

STUDY QUESTION: Are monkey testicular peritubular cells (MKTPCs) from the common 
marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus) a suitable translational model for the study
of human testicular peritubular cells (HTPCs)?
SUMMARY ANSWER: MKTPCs can be isolated and propagated in vitro, retain
characteristic markers for testicular peritubular cells and their proteome
strongly (correlation coefficient of 0.78) overlaps with the proteome of HTPCs.
WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Smooth-muscle-like peritubular cells form the wall of
seminiferous tubules, transport sperm, are immunologically active, secrete a
plethora of factors and may contribute to the spermatogonial stem cell niche.
Mechanistic studies are hampered by heterogeneity of human samples.
STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: We established a culture method for MKTPCs and
characterized these cells from six young adult animals (2-3 years). To examine
whether they qualify as a translational model we also examined HTPCs from seven
men and compared the proteomes of both groups.
PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: We used explant cultures to obtain
MKTPCs, which express smooth muscle markers (calponin (CNN1), smooth muscle actin
(ACTA2)), lack FSH-receptors (FSHR) and LH-receptors (LHCGR), but possess
androgen receptors (AR). MKTPCs can be passaged at least up to eight times,
without discernable phenotypic changes. Mass-spectrometry-based analyses of the
MKTPC and HTPC proteomes were performed.
MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: We established a method for isolation and
cultivation of MKTPCs, and provide a comprehensive analysis of their protein
repertoire. The results let us conclude that MKTPCs are suitable as a non-human
primate model to study peritubular cell functions.
LARGE SCALE DATA: List of identified proteins in MKTPCs by liquid
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry is accessible at the ProteomeXchange
(identifier PXD009394).
LIMITATIONS, REASON FOR CAUTION: This is an in vitro cellular non-human primate
model used to provide a window into the role of these cells in the human testis.
WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Previous studies with HTPCs from patients
revealed a degree of heterogeneity, possibly due to age, lifestyle and medical
history of the individual human donors. We anticipate that the new translational 
model, derived from young healthy non-human primates, may allow us to circumvent 
these issues and may lead to a better understanding of the role of peritubular
cells.

Common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is emerging as a clinically relevant
nonhuman primate model for various diseases, but is hindered by the availability 
of marmoset cell lines, which are critical for understanding the disease
pathogenesis and drug/toxicological screening prior to animal testing. Here we
describe the generation of immortalized marmoset hepatic progenitor cells (MHPCs)
by lentivirus-mediated transfer of the simian virus 40 large T antigen gene in
fetal liver polygonal cells. MHPCs proliferate indefinitely in vitro without
chromosomal alteration and telomere shortening. These cells possess hepatic
progenitor cell-specific gene expression profiles with potential to differentiate
into both hepatocytic and cholangiocytic lineages in vitro and in vivo and also
can be genetically modified. Importantly, injected MHPCs repopulated the injured 
liver of fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (Fah)-deficient mice with hepatocyte-like 
cells. MHPCs also engraft as cholangiocytes into bile ducts of
3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine (DDC)-induced bile ductular injured
mice. MHPCs provide a tool to enable efficient derivation and genetic
modification of both hepatocytes and cholangiocytes for use in disease modeling, 
tissue engineering, and drug screening.

Although macaque monkeys have been dominant models in visual neuroscience, recent
scientific advances suggest that marmosets provide a valuable alternative in the 
context of many types of experiments. Here we focus on the middle temporal area
(MT), the most extensively studied extrastriate area in primates, and discuss
similarities and differences between marmosets and macaques. The basic response
properties of MT cells are similar in these species, including direction
selectivity, speed tuning, and receptive field centre-surround organization.
However, there are differences associated with spatial processing: receptive
fields are larger in the marmoset than in the macaque, and MT neurons have
preferences for lower spatial frequencies. Comparative analysis of anatomical
connections show neural projections from several higher-order association areas
to marmoset MT, which seem to be absent or reduced in the macaque. This suggests 
that cognitive processes could influence the activity of marmoset MT cells more
directly. Despite a relative reduction in visual acuity, the present knowledge
about the anatomy and physiology of MT in the marmoset suggests that simple
low-level visual tasks, which are standard in the literature, are well within the
capabilities of marmosets, opening the way for comparative studies of perception 
and cognition in primate brains of different sizes.

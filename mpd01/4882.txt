On the sublingual structures of Tarsius (Prosimiae, Tarsiiformes) and some
platyrrhine monkeys (Platyrrhina, Simiae, Primates) with casual remarks on the
histology of the tongue. In memoriam William Charles Osman Hill.

Hofer HO.

The sublingual structures of Tarsius, Cebuella and Callithrix are studied
microscopically. Tarsius has a well developed but not specialized sublingua. In
the platyrrhine monkeys the sublingua is lacking completely, but the frenal
lamella (plica sublingualis) is very specialized. From this it is concluded that 
the sublingual organ of Callicebus is a topographically modified frenal lamella, 
not a sublingua.

Hobbs KR, Clough G, Bleby J.

The establishment of 3 specified-pathogen-free marmosets (Callithrix jacchus)
during the period May 1969 to January 1973 is described. A brief history of the
conventional breeding colony from which the animals were derived is given and

Locomotion is precarious in an arboreal habitat, where supports can vary in both 
diameter and level of compliance. Several previous studies have evaluated the
influence of substrate diameter on the locomotor performance of arboreal
quadrupeds. The influence of substrate compliance, however, has been mostly
unexamined. Here, we used a multifactorial experimental design to investigate how
perturbations in both diameter and compliance affect the gait kinematics of
marmosets (Callithrix jacchus; N=2) moving over simulated arboreal substrates. We
used 3D-calibrated video to quantify marmoset locomotion over a horizontal
trackway consisting of variably sized poles (5, 2.5 and 1.25 cm in diameter),
analyzing a total of 120 strides. The central portion of the trackway was either 
immobile or mounted on compliant foam blocks, depending on condition. We found
that narrowing diameter and increasing compliance were both associated with
relatively longer substrate contact durations, though adjustments to diameter
were often inconsistent relative to compliance-related adjustments. Marmosets
also responded to narrowing diameter by reducing speed, flattening center of mass
(CoM) movements and dampening support displacement on the compliant substrate.
For the subset of strides on the compliant support, we found that speed, contact 
duration and CoM amplitude explained >60% of the variation in substrate
displacement over a stride, suggesting a direct performance advantage to these
kinematic adjustments. Overall, our results show that compliant substrates can
exert a significant influence on gait kinematics. Substrate compliance, and not
just support diameter, should be considered a critical environmental variable
when evaluating locomotor performance in arboreal quadrupeds.

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) causes sporadic zoonotic 
disease and healthcare-associated outbreaks in human. MERS is often complicated
by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi-organ failure(1,2). The
high incidence of renal failure in MERS is a unique clinical feature not often
found in other human coronavirus infections(3,4). Whether MERS-CoV infects the
kidney and how it triggers renal failure are not understood(5,6). Here, we
demonstrated renal infection and apoptotic induction by MERS-CoV in human ex vivo
organ culture and a nonhuman primate model. High-throughput analysis revealed
that the cellular genes most significantly perturbed by MERS-CoV have previously 
been implicated in renal diseases. Furthermore, MERS-CoV induced apoptosis
through upregulation of Smad7 and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) expression in
both kidney and lung cells. Conversely, knockdown of Smad7 effectively inhibited 
MERS-CoV replication and protected cells from virus-induced cytopathic effects.
We further demonstrated that hyperexpression of Smad7 or FGF2 induced a strong
apoptotic response in kidney cells. Common marmosets infected by MERS-CoV
developed ARDS and disseminated infection in kidneys and other organs. Smad7 and 
FGF2 expression were elevated in the lungs and kidneys of the infected animals.
Our results provide insights into the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV and host targets
for treatment.

The pathogenicity of a newly discovered human mycoplasma (strain G37) for the
genital tract of marmosets.

Taylor-Robinson D, Furr PM, Hetherington CM.

In an attempt to demonstrate the pathogenicity of a newly discovered mycoplasma
(strain G37) isolated from the human genital tract, six female marmosets
(Callithix jacchus) were inoculated intravaginally. Four of the animals were
infected as indicated by repeated recovery of the organisms on vaginal swabbing, 
and infection persisted for 72-149 days or more. In addition, the infected
marmosets exhibited a serum antibody response detected most easily by an
immunofluorescence technique, and a persistent vaginal polymorphonuclear
leucocyte response not seen in two uninfected and in two uninoculated animals.

Development of a marmoset colony in Australia.

McIntosh GH, Looker JW.

A breeding nucleus of 15 pairs of Callithrix jacchus jacchus was imported from an
established colony in the United Kingdom in 1978, and these have now multiplied
to 137 animals. Good reproductive efficiency and growth rates have occurred in
this colony, with minimal problems from diseases of nutritional or infectious
origin. One episode of cessation of breeding and abortions was attributed to
excessive noise and disturbance of the normal routine.

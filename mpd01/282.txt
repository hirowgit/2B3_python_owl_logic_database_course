Yellow fever virus (YFV) causes a clinical syndrome of acute hemorrhagic
hepatitis. YFV transmission involves non-human primates (NHP), mosquitoes and
humans. By late 2016, Brazil experienced the largest YFV outbreak of the last 100
years, with 2050 human confirmed cases, with 681 cases ending in death and 764
confirmed epizootic cases in NHP. Among affected areas, Bahia state in
Northeastern was the only region with no autochthonous human cases. By using next
generation sequence approach, we investigated the molecular epidemiology of YFV
in NHP in Bahia and discuss what factors might have prevented human cases. We
investigated 47 YFV positive tissue samples from NHP cases to generate 8 novel
YFV genomes. ML phylogenetic tree reconstructions and automated subtyping tools
placed the newly generated genomes within the South American genotype I (SA I).
Our analysis revealed that the YFV genomes from Bahia formed two distinct
well-supported phylogenetic clusters that emerged most likely of an introduction 
from Minas Gerais and Espírito Santo states. Vegetation coverage analysis
performed shows predominantly low to medium vegetation coverage in Bahia state.
Together, our findings support the hypothesis of two independent YFV SA-I
introductions. We also highlighted the effectiveness of the actions taken by
epidemiological surveillance team of the state to prevented human cases.

Cytosolic sulfotransferases (SULTs), which mediate the conjugation of drugs with 
3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate, have been characterized in humans and
cynomolgus monkeys. However, SULTs remain to be evaluated in common marmosets, a 
species of non-human primate often employed in drug metabolism and
pharmacokinetic studies of endogenous and exogenous compounds. In this study,
marmoset SULT1A1, 1A3, 1B1, 1C2, 1E1, and 2A1 cDNAs were isolated and
characterized, based on genome data. The deduced amino acid sequences of these
marmoset SULT cDNAs had high identities (90-95%) with their human orthologs,
except for marmoset SULT2A1, which was only 81% identical to human SULT2A1. The
amino acid sequences of the orthologs of these six SULTs in marmosets, monkeys,
and humans were closely clustered in a phylogenetic tree. The structures and
genomic organizations of marmoset SULT genes were similar to those of their human
orthologs. Among the five marmoset tissues analyzed, SULT mRNAs showed typical
expression patterns. The most abundant SULT mRNAs were SULT1B1 in liver, small
intestine, and kidney; SULT1E1 in lung; and SULT1A3 in brain. Recombinant
marmoset SULT1A1, 1A3, 1B1, 1C2, 1E1, and 2A1 proteins expressed in bacterial
cytosolic fractions mediated sulfate conjugations with
3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate of the following typical human SULT
substrates: dopamine, 1-naphthol, p-nitrophenol, estradiol, and
dehydroepiandrosterone. Taken together, these wide-ranging results suggest
functional and molecular similarities of SULTs among marmosets, monkeys, and
humans.

Data on spontaneous pathology are substantially scarce for common marmosets,
compared to other laboratory animals, but is essential for the interpretation of 
histological findings in the context of toxicological and experimental studies.
Especially if common marmosets are used as experimental animals in respiratory
research, detailed knowledge on the spectrum, occurrence, and incidence of
spontaneous histopathological pulmonary lesions in this non-human primate species
is required. In this study, lung tissue of 638 common marmosets from the marmoset
colony of the German Primate Center was examined histologically. The analysis
revealed a high incidence of predominantly mild and multifocal interstitial
pneumonia (32.99 %) of unknown etiology in most cases. Only few marmosets
exhibited lobar pneumonia (1.41 %) and bronchopneumonia (0.94), which were mainly
caused by bacterial pathogens such as Bordetella bronchiseptica and Klebsiella
pneumoniae. Lung immaturity and atelectasis were common histological findings in 
newborn marmosets. Typical background lesions included anthracosis (8.15 %),
hemosiderosis (1.72 %), extramedullary hematopoiesis (11.6 %), mineralization
(10.97 %), and inflammatory cell foci (10.34 %). In addition, three cases of
pulmonary arteriopathy (0.47 %) and 1 case of foreign-body granuloma (0.16 %)
were detected in the marmoset study cohort. The high prevalence of circulatory
disturbances (congestion, edema, hemorrhage) and changes in air content
(secondary atelectasis, alveolar emphysema) could partly be explained by
euthanasia-related artifacts or agonal changes. The present study provides a
comprehensive overview of the range and incidence of spontaneous pulmonary
histopathology in common marmosets, serving as valuable reference data for the
interpretation of lung lesions in toxicological and experimental marmoset
studies.

The nuclear envelope (NE), a structural element of fundamental importance for the
cell, is the first barrier that meets a virus in the early stages of viral
maturation. Therefore, in order to allow the passage of nucleocapsids, viruses
are known to modulate the architecture of the nuclear membrane to permit a
proficient viral infection. Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), a pathogen from Herpesvirus
family, possesses two well conserved proteins, BFRF1 and BFLF2, which together
form the heterodimeric nuclear egress complex (NEC) that is involved in the early
steps of nuclear egress. Here we show that EBV replication causes the
delocalization of emerin, a cellular LEM-domain protein normally distributed on
the nuclear rim. We also demonstrate that the early lytic protein BFRF1 is
responsible for emerin delocalization. Expression of BFRF1 alone or in
combination with BFLF2 induces emerin hyperphosphorylation. Altogether, these
results suggest a novel mechanism by which EBV exploits the cellular machinery
for nucleocapsid egress.

Radiographic evaluation of appendicular skeletal maturation in the common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).

Schultea TD, Smallwood JE, Stott GG.

The thoracic appendicular skeletal development of five common marmosets was
monitored radiographically at weekly intervals from 1 day to 94 weeks of age and 
the times of appearance and fusion of 47 ossification centers were recorded. A
range and average age for the appearance and fusion of each ossification center
were calculated and compared to data available for the rhesus monkey and man.

Body weight changes throughout pregnancy in the common marmoset Callithrix
jacchus.

Lunn SF.

Adult female common marmosets were weighed weekly for periods of 6-30 months. Of 
27 animals, 25 were pregnant at some stage of the investigation. Patterns of body
weight change throughout singleton, twin and triplet pregnancies were obtained
and compared. Maternal weight increase was dependent on the number of young in
utero; however, little or no change in weight was observed during the first 13
weeks of gestation, irrespective of the number of offspring delivered
subsequently. The overall maternal:fetal body weight ratio was 1.00:0.21, ranging
from 1.00:0.11 for singleton to 1.00:0.26 for triplet pregnancies. Lactation had 
little or no effect on maternal body weight during the first 4 weeks postpartum.

The eyes absent (EYA)-like genes are essential for the formation of sensory
organs among fly (Drosophila melanogaster) and mammals. EYA4, one of the
vertebrate genes of Eya family, is reported to be causative for late-onset
mid-frequency sensorineural hearing loss in humans, while Eya4-deficient mice
exhibited congenital profound deafness and otitis media with effusion due to the 
eustachian tube dysmorphology. Because of the species difference in the
phenotype, the pathophysiology of EYA4 in the human cochlea has yet to be
elucidated. Here, we examine the expression pattern of EYA4 in the cochlea of
common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a non-human primate. The results indicated 
a distinct expression pattern of EYA4 in the adult marmoset cochleae, especially 
strong in all supporting cells, while in mouse their expressions were diminished.
Interestingly, EYA4 expression in the hair cells, supporting cells and neurons
was co-localized with sine oculis homeobox-SIX1, a transcription factor essential
for the transcriptional activity of EYA4. The results revealed inter-species
differences in the expression pattern of EYA4 gene in supporting cells between
primates and rodents. The results also indicated a fundamental role of EYA4 in
the primate auditory cells. Experiments with primate models such as marmosets or 
with human cochlear cells may provide cues about the unknown pathogenesis of
EYA4-related hearing loss.

Acute and repeated exposure to cocaine alters the cognitive performance of humans
and animals. How each administration schedule affects the same memory task has
yet to be properly established in nonhuman primates. Therefore, we assessed the
performance of marmoset monkeys in a spontaneous object-location (SOL)
recognition memory task after acute and repeated exposure to cocaine (COC;
5mg/kg, ip). Two identical neutral stimuli were explored on the 10-min sample
trial, after which preferential exploration of the displaced vs the stationary
object was analyzed on the 10-min test trial. For the acute treatment, cocaine
was given immediately after the sample presentation, and spatial recognition was 
then tested after a 24-h interval. For the repeated exposure schedule, daily
cocaine injections were given on 7 consecutive days. After a 7-day drug-free
period, the SOL task was carried out with a 10-min intertrial interval. When
given acutely postsample, COC improved the marmosets' recognition memory, whereas
it had a detrimental effect after the repeated exposure. Thus, depending on the
administration schedule, COC exerted opposing effects on the marmosets' ability
to recognize spatial changes. This agrees with recent studies in rodents and the 
recognition impairment seen in human addicts. Further studies related to the
effects of cocaine's acute×prior drug history on the same cognitive domain are
warranted.

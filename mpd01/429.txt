An increasing number of studies suggest that olfaction is important for
communication throughout the order of primates. Callitrichids, in particular,
have well-developed olfactory systems and use anogenital glands to produce scent 
marks. Behavioural studies have shown that male common marmosets (Callithrix
jacchus) distinguish between odours from the peri-ovulatory and luteal phase of
females. However, large gaps remain in understanding the chemical underpinnings
of olfactory cues. To investigate whether chemical cues vary with female
fertility and reproductive quality, our study combined behavioural bioassays with
chemical analyses of the anogenital odours of female common marmosets using gas
chromatography-mass spectrometry. We found that cycle states, age and parity have
an impact on chemical profiles and further identified affected chemical
substances. Our results confirm and expand on previous behavioural evidence for
cues of fertility. Our results indicate that cycle-related substances likely act 
as chemical cues. Males could use such olfactory fertility cues to optimize their
mating effort and thereby increase their paternity certainty. This certainty
could enhance paternal care for their infants. The results of our study open a
promising avenue to find the metabolic pathways from which chemical cues of
fertility arise and to unravel their importance during primate evolution in
future comparative studies.

Background: Recently, the use of common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) has
increased in biomedical research as an animal model. This study aimed to test
fecal samples to monitor bacterial and parasite infections in common marmoset at 
the Laboratory Animal Center of Osong Medical Innovation Foundation in Korea.
Methods: To monitor bacteria and parasites in common marmoset, we tested 43 fecal
samples of 43 common marmosets by culture and parasitological test in 2014.
Infection by Chilomastix mesnili was determined by PCR method.
Results: We identified nonpathogenic bacteria such as Proteus mirabilis and
Escherichia coli in feces of normal common marmosets. Interestingly, C. mesnili
was isolated from a healthy common marmoset by fecal centrifugation concentration
and PCR. The monkey infected with C. mesnili was treated with metronidazole.
After the treatment, C. mesnili were not found in feces using fecal
centrifugation concentration and PCR.
Conclusion: This is the first case report of C. mesnili infection in common
marmoset. Treatment with metronidazole is found to be highly effective in
eradicating C. mesnili infection in common marmoset.

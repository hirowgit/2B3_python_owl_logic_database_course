With the medial frontal cortex (MFC) centrally implicated in several major
neuropsychiatric disorders, it is critical to understand the extent to which MFC 
organization is comparable between humans and animals commonly used in
preclinical research (namely rodents and nonhuman primates). Although the
cytoarchitectonic structure of the rodent MFC has mostly been conserved in
humans, it is a long-standing question whether the structural analogies translate
to functional analogies. Here, we probed this question using ultra high field
fMRI data to compare rat, marmoset, and human MFC functional connectivity. First,
we applied hierarchical clustering to intrinsically define the functional
boundaries of the MFC in all three species, independent of cytoarchitectonic
definitions. Then, we mapped the functional connectivity "fingerprints" of these 
regions with a number of different brain areas. Because rats do not share
cytoarchitectonically defined regions of the lateral frontal cortex (LFC) with
primates, the fingerprinting method also afforded the unique ability to compare
the rat MFC and marmoset LFC, which have often been suggested to be functional
analogs. The results demonstrated remarkably similar intrinsic functional
organization of the MFC across the species, but clear differences between rodent 
and primate MFC whole-brain connectivity. Rat MFC patterns of connectivity showed
greatest similarity with premotor regions in the marmoset, rather than
dorsolateral prefrontal regions, which are often suggested to be functionally
comparable. These results corroborate the viability of the marmoset as a
preclinical model of human MFC dysfunction, and suggest divergence of functional 
connectivity between rats and primates in both the MFC and LFC.

Identification of a suitable nonhuman primate (NHP) model of COVID-19 remains
challenging. Here, we characterized severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in three NHP species: Old World monkeys Macaca mulatta
(M. mulatta) and Macaca fascicularis (M. fascicularis) and New World monkey
Callithrix jacchus (C. jacchus). Infected M. mulatta and M. fascicularis showed
abnormal chest radiographs, an increased body temperature and a decreased body
weight. Viral genomes were detected in swab and blood samples from all animals.
Viral load was detected in the pulmonary tissues of M. mulatta and M.
fascicularis but not C. jacchus. Furthermore, among the three animal species, M. 
mulatta showed the strongest response to SARS-CoV-2, including increased
inflammatory cytokine expression and pathological changes in the pulmonary
tissues. Collectively, these data revealed the different susceptibilities of Old 
World and New World monkeys to SARS-CoV-2 and identified M. mulatta as the most
suitable for modeling COVID-19.

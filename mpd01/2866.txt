HV(MNE) is an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-like lymphocryptovirus (LCV) originally
isolated from a Macaca nemestrina with CD8(+) T cell mycosis fungoides/cutaneous 
T cell lymphoma (Blood 98 (2001), 2193). HV(MNE) transforms rabbit T cells in
vitro and causes T cell lymphoma in New Zealand white rabbits. Here we
demonstrate that HV(MNE) also immortalizes T cells from mustached tamarins but
not those from owl monkeys, common marmosets, squirrel monkeys, black-capped
capuchins, and humans. Cytogenetic and FACS analysis revealed the true origin and
T cell lineage of the transformed tamarin T cell lines. Tamarin T cells contained
HV(MNE) DNA sequence and displayed a decreased requirement for the IL-2 cytokine 
for growth. Thus, this EBV-like virus from M. nemestrina differs from the other
EBV-like viruses found in nonhuman primates inasmuch as it appears to
preferentially transform T cells.

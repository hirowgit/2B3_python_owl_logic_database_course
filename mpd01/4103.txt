The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a small, diurnal, New World monkey
amenable to vision research. In this paper we describe the visual optics and cone
photoreceptor topography of the normal adult marmoset. Paraxial optical
ray-tracing shows that the marmoset eye is well represented as a scaled-down
version of the human eye. The density of foveal and perifoveal cone
photoreceptors in the marmoset is as high, and in peripheral retina higher, than 
those reported in humans and macaques. The foveal acuity predicted by the Nyquist
limits set by the cone mosaic (30 c/deg) is in agreement with behavioral measures
of visual acuity. Foveal depth of focus is remarkably small (< 0.2 D) for an eye 
of this size (axial length about 11 mm). Estimates of the amplitude of
accommodation using infrared photorefraction indicate that the marmoset is
capable of more than 20 D of accommodation.

Sixty skeletons of Callithrix jacchus were examined to identify
spondyloarthropathy. Erosive disease in Callithrix was confirmed as
spondyloarthropathy on the basis of diagnostic sacroiliac erosions, syndesmophyte
formation, and the nature and distribution of the peripheral joint erosions.

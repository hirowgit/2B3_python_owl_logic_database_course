For achieving retrograde gene transfer, we have so far developed two types of
lentiviral vectors pseudotyped with fusion envelope glycoprotein, termed HiRet
vector and NeuRet vector, consisting of distinct combinations of rabies virus and
vesicular stomatitis virus glycoproteins. In the present study, we compared the
patterns of retrograde transgene expression for the HiRet vs. NeuRet vectors by
testing the cortical input system. These vectors were injected into the motor
cortex in rats, marmosets, and macaques, and the distributions of retrograde
labels were investigated in the cortex and thalamus. Our histological analysis
revealed that the NeuRet vector generally exhibits a higher efficiency of
retrograde gene transfer than the HiRet vector, though its capacity of retrograde
transgene expression in the macaque brain is unexpectedly low, especially in
terms of the intracortical connections, as compared to the rat and marmoset
brains. It was also demonstrated that the NeuRet but not the HiRet vector
displays sufficiently high neuron specificity and causes no marked
inflammatory/immune responses at the vector injection sites in the primate
(marmoset and macaque) brains. The present results indicate that the retrograde
transgene efficiency of the NeuRet vector varies depending not only on the
species but also on the input projections.

Studies of personality traits in common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) indicate
that there are five or six constructs-Sociability, Dominance, Neuroticism,
Openness, and two related to Conscientiousness. The present study attempted to
determine whether our earlier study of laboratory-housed individuals only yielded
three-Dominance, Sociability, and Neuroticism-because of a low amount of
between-subjects variance. To do so, we increased our sample size from 77 to 128.
In addition, we ascertained the reliability and validity of ratings and whether
polymorphisms related to the serotonin 1a receptor were associated with
personality. We found Sociability, Dominance, and Negative Affect factors that
resembled three domains found in previous studies, including ours. We also found 
an Openness and Impulsiveness factor, the latter of which bore some resemblance
to Conscientiousness, and two higher-order factors, Pro-sociality and Boldness.
In further analyses, we could not exclude the possibility that Pro-sociality and 
Boldness represented a higher-level of personality organization. Correlations
between personality factors and well-being were consistent with the definitions
of the factors. There were no significant associations between personality and
genotype. These results suggest that common marmoset personality structure varies
as a function of rearing or housing variables that have not yet been investigated
systematically.

BACKGROUND: Due to a sporadic occurrence of Mycobacterium avium subsp.
paratuberculosis (MAP) in non-human primates (NHP), the susceptibility of
different NHP to MAP should be investigated.
METHODS: Fecal and tissue samples (ileum, ileocecal lymph node, bone marrow) of
20 animals (seven species) were analyzed by IS900-based PCRs and sequenced.
Samples of MAP PCR positive NHP were further cultivated.
RESULTS: MAP DNA was detectable in two animals; the ileum of a cottontop tamarin 
and the bone marrow of a common marmoset. Cultivation of MAP failed. Sequence
analysis revealed 100% homology to the MAP-K10 sequence. Pathohistological
examinations offered no direct correlation to a MAP infection.
CONCLUSIONS: MAP was detected for the first time in a common marmoset. But as
both NHP suffered from other diseases, an asymptomatic infection with MAP was
assumed. The detection of MAP in the bone marrow might play a role in
establishing latent paratuberculosis, as known from tuberculosis.

Slow loris (Nycticebus spp.) captive diets have been based on routine and
anecdotes rather than scientific fact. The growing body of evidence contradicts
the high fruit diet supported by such anecdotes. Non-human primate nutrient
requirements are grouped into new (based on the common marmoset Callithrix
jacchus) or old world (based on rhesus macaques Macaca mulatta) primates. Slow
lorises are known to suffer from many health ailments in captivity such as dental
disease, obesity, wasting and kidney issues all of which have been linked to
diet. This study aimed to estimate nutrient intake from free-ranging slow lorises
and to determine whether this intake can be used as nutrient recommendations. We 
collected data of nutrient intake, food passage rate and digestibility of captive
slow lorises on three diet treatments 1: current captive type diet which is
mostly fruits, 2: wild-type diet made only of food items from their natural diet,
3: new diet made to reflect wild slow loris nutrient intake. In order to validate
our nutrient recommendations, diets 2 and 3 would have to be significantly
different to Diet 1 in terms of nutrients, but not different from each other.
Captive diets were significantly higher in soluble carbohydrates and lower in
minerals and fibre fractions than both diets 2 and 3. Diets 2 and 3 led to a
significantly increased food passage time and to more effective fibre and calcium
digestion compared to Diet 1. We also observed obese individuals lost weight and 
underweight individuals gained weight. Our nutrient recommendations have been
validated by our trials, and new or old world monkey nutrient recommendations are
not consistent with our results. Diets should be high in protein and fibre and
low in soluble carbohydrates and fats.

BACKGROUND: The impact of the intrauterine environment on the developmental
programming of adult female reproductive success is still poorly understood and
potentially underestimated. Litter size variation in a nonhuman primate, the
common marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus), allows us to model the effects of
varying intrauterine environments (e.g. nutrient restriction, exposure to male
womb-mates) on the risk of losing fetuses in adulthood. Our previous work has
characterized the fetuses of triplet pregnancies as experiencing intrauterine
nutritional restriction.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used over a decade of demographic data from
the Southwest National Primate Research Center common marmoset colony. We
evaluated differences between twin and triplet females in the number of
pregnancies they produce and the proportion of those pregnancies that ended in
fetal loss. We found that triplet females produced the same number of total
offspring as twin females, but lost offspring during pregnancy at a significantly
higher rate than did twins (38% vs. 13%, p = 0.02). Regardless of their own birth
weight or the sex ratio of the litter the experienced as fetuses, triplet females
lost more fetuses than did twins. Females with a male littermate experienced a
significant increase in the proportion of stillbirths.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These striking findings anchor pregnancy loss in the
mother's own fetal environment and development, underscoring a "Womb to Womb"
view of the lifecourse and the intergenerational consequences of development.
This has important translational implications for understanding the large
proportion of human stillbirths that are unexplained. Our findings provide strong
evidence that a full understanding of mammalian life history and reproductive
biology requires a developmental foundation.

Six Gram-positive-staining, microaerophilic, non-spore-forming,
fructose-6-phosphate phosphoketolase-positive bacterial strains with a peculiar
morphology were isolated from faecal samples of baby common marmosets (Callithrix
jacchus). Cells of these strains showed a morphology not reported previously for 
a bifidobacterial species, which resembled a coiled snake, always coiled or ring 
shaped or forming a 'Y' shape. Strains MRM 3/1(T) and MRM 4/2 were chosen as
representative strains and characterized further. The bacteria utilized a wide
range of carbohydrates and produced urease. Glucose was fermented to acetate and 
lactate. Strain MRM 3/1(T) showed a peptidoglycan type unique among members of
the genus Bifidobacterium. The DNA base composition was 64.7 mol% G+C.
Almost-complete 16S rRNA, hsp60, clpC and rpoB gene sequences were obtained and
phylogenetic relationships were determined. Comparative analysis of 16S rRNA gene
sequences showed that strains MRM 3/1(T) and MRM 4/2 had the highest similarities
to Bifidobacterium scardovii DSM 13734(T) (94.6%) and Bifidobacterium
stellenboschense DSM 23968(T) (94.5%). Analysis of hsp60 showed that both strains
were closely related to B. stellenboschense DSM 23968(T) (97.5% similarity);
however, despite this high degree of similarity, our isolates could be
distinguished from B. stellenboschense DSM 23968(T) by low levels of DNA-DNA
relatedness (30.4% with MRM 3/1(T)). Strains MRM 3/1(T) and MRM 4/2 were located 
in an actinobacterial cluster and were more closely related to the genus
Bifidobacterium than to other genera in the family Bifidobacteriaceae. On the
basis of these results, strains MRM 3/1(T) and MRM 4/2 represent a novel species 
within the genus Bifidobacterium, for which the name Bifidobacterium aesculapii
sp. nov. is proposed; the type strain is MRM 3/1(T) ( = DSM 26737(T) = JCM
18761(T)).

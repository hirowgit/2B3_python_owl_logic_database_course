A seven-year-old female common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) presented with
weight loss. Imaging revealed a left thoracic mass, confirmed at necropsy.
Histology and immunohistochemistry suggested a well-differentiated pulmonary
adenocarcinoma. No evidence of local lymphovascular invasion or distant
metastasis was observed. This is the first report of pulmonary adenocarcinoma in 
marmosets.

The Brazilian buffy-tufted-ear marmoset (Callithrix aurita), one of the world's
most endangered primates, is threatened by anthropogenic hybridization with
exotic, invasive marmoset species. As there are few genetic data available for C.
aurita, we developed a PCR-free protocol with minimal technical requirements to
rapidly generate genomic data with genomic skimming and portable nanopore
sequencing. With this direct DNA sequencing approach, we successfully determined 
the complete mitogenome of a marmoset that we initially identified as C. aurita. 
The obtained nanopore-assembled sequence was highly concordant with a Sanger
sequenced version of the same mitogenome. Phylogenetic analyses unexpectedly
revealed that our specimen was a cryptic hybrid, with a C. aurita phenotype and
C. penicillata mitogenome lineage. We also used publicly available mitogenome
data to determine diversity estimates for C. aurita and three other marmoset
species. Mitogenomics holds great potential to address deficiencies in genomic
data for endangered, non-model species such as C. aurita. However, we discuss why
mitogenomic approaches should be used in conjunction with other data for marmoset
species identification. Finally, we discuss the utility and implications of our
results and genomic skimming/nanopore approach for conservation and evolutionary 
studies of C. aurita and other marmosets.

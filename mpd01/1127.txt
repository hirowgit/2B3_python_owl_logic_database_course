Two-photon imaging with genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) enables
long-term observation of neuronal activity in vivo. However, there are very few
studies of GECIs in primates. Here, we report a method for long-term imaging of a
GECI, GCaMP6f, expressed from adeno-associated virus vectors in cortical neurons 
of the adult common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a small New World primate. We 
used a tetracycline-inducible expression system to robustly amplify neuronal
GCaMP6f expression and up- and downregulate it for more than 100 days. We
succeeded in monitoring spontaneous activity not only from hundreds of neurons
three-dimensionally distributed in layers 2 and 3 but also from single dendrites 
and axons in layer 1. Furthermore, we detected selective activities from somata, 
dendrites, and axons in the somatosensory cortex responding to specific tactile
stimuli. Our results provide a way to investigate the organization and plasticity
of cortical microcircuits at subcellular resolution in non-human primates.

Phenotypic sex differences in primates are associated with body differentiation
during the early stages of life, expressed in both physiological and behavioral
features. Hormones seem to play a pivotal role in creating a range of responses
to meet environmental and social demands, resulting in better reactions to cope
with challenges to survival and reproduction. Steroid hormones actively
participate in neuroplasticity and steroids from both gonads and neurons seem to 
be involved in behavioral modulation in primates. Indirect evidence suggests the 
participation of sexual steroids in dimorphism of the stress response in common
marmosets. This species is an important experimental model in psychiatry, and we 
found a dual profile for cortisol in the transition from juvenile to subadult,
with females showing higher levels. Immature males and females at 6 and 9 months 
of age moved alone from the family group to a new cage, over a 21-day period,
expressed distinct patterns of cortisol variation with respect to range and
duration of response. Additional evidence showed that at 12 months of age, males 
and females buffered the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis during chronic
stress. Moreover, chronic stressed juvenile marmoset males showed better
cognitive performance in working memory tests and motivation when compared to
those submitted to short-term stress living in family groups. Thus, as cortisol
profile seems to be sexually dimorphic before adulthood, age and sex are critical
variables to consider in approaches that require immature marmosets in their
experimental protocols. Moreover, available cognitive tests should be scrutinized
to allow better investigation of cognitive traits in this species.

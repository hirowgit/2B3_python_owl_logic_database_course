Fatal lymphoproliferative disease in a common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus)
following inoculation of Ag876 strain of Epstein-Barr virus and a tumor-promoting
agent: preliminary report.

We report here the development of a fatal lymphoproliferative disease in a common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) following inoculation of the Ag876 strain of
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and of the tumor promoting agent
12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). The marmoset showed antibodies
against EBV capsid and early antigens (VCA, EA) but not against nuclear antigen
(EBNA). EBNA was detected in impression smears from lymph nodes and liver, and
the presence of the EBV genome was detected from the same organs by hydridization
techniques. To our knowledge this is the first report of the oncogenicity of this
strain of EBV. The need for further studies to assess the in vivo interaction
between EBV and tumor promoting agents in the development of malignancies is
stressed.

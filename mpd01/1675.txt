PURPOSE: To describe the pre-surgical, surgical, and post-surgical considerations
for phacoemulsification in non-human primates.
METHODS: Records of non-human primates that underwent phacoemulsification by the 
Ophthalmology Services of FHCV-UAB and HCV-UM, between 2003 and 2009 were
reviewed.
RESULTS: Five primates were represented: one gorilla, one chimpanzee, one pygmy
marmoset, one orangutan, and one chacma baboon. Three were males and two females,
of a median age of 16.8 years. Four primates presented bilateral cataracts and
one unilateral (n = 9 eyes). Cataracts were immature in two eyes, mature in four 
and hypermature in 3. One-handed phacoemulsification was used in seven eyes and a
two-handed technique in 2. Intraocular lenses (IOLs), with optic powers between
+19.0 and +21.5D, were implanted in the four large-sized primates. All the
primates were more active and social after the surgery.
CONCLUSION: Phacoemulsification in non-human primates is highly successful and
associated with an overall good visual outcome. Nevertheless, specific
considerations should be applied in these species.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a small New World primate, has been
attracting much attention in the research field of biomedical science and
neuroscience, based on its (i) cross-reactivity with human cytokines or hormones,
(ii) comparative ease in handling due to its small size, (iii) high reproductive 
efficiency, (iv) establishment of basic research tools, and (v) advantages of its
unique behavioral and cognitive characters. Various neurological disease models
have been developed in the common marmoset, including Parkinson's disease,
Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, stroke, multiple sclerosis and spinal 
cord injury. We recently developed transgenic common marmoset with germline
transmission, which is expected to provide a new animal model for the study of
human diseases. In this review, we summarize the recent progress of biomedical
research and neuroscience using common marmoset as an excellent model system.

In marmoset T cells transformed by Herpesvirus saimiri (HVS), a viral U-rich
noncoding (nc) RNA, HSUR 1, specifically mediates degradation of host microRNA-27
(miR-27). High-throughput sequencing of RNA after crosslinking
immunoprecipitation (HITS-CLIP) identified mRNAs targeted by miR-27 as enriched
in the T cell receptor (TCR) signaling pathway, including GRB2. Accordingly,
transfection of miR-27 into human T cells attenuates TCR-induced activation of
mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and induction of CD69. MiR-27 also
robustly regulates SEMA7A and IFN-γ, key modulators and effectors of T cell
function. Knockdown or ectopic expression of HSUR 1 alters levels of these
proteins in virally transformed cells. Two other T-lymphotropic γ-herpesviruses, 
AlHV-1 and OvHV-2, do not produce a noncoding RNA to downregulate miR-27 but
instead encode homologs of miR-27 target genes. Thus, oncogenic γ-herpesviruses
have evolved diverse strategies to converge on common targets in host T cells.

We studied the functional connectivity of cells in the lateral geniculate nucleus
(LGN) with the primary visual cortex (V1) in anesthetized marmosets (Callithrix
jacchus). The LGN sends signals to V1 along parallel visual pathways called
parvocellular (P), magnocellular (M), and koniocellular (K). To better understand
how these pathways provide inputs to V1, we antidromically activated relay cells 
in the LGN by electrically stimulating V1 and measuring the conduction latencies 
of P (n = 7), M (n = 14), and the "Blue-ON" (n = 5) subgroup of K cells (K-BON
cells). We found that the antidromic latencies of K-BON cells were similar to
those of P cells. We also measured the response latencies to high contrast visual
stimuli for a subset of cells. We found the LGN cells that have the shortest
latency of response to visual stimulation also have the shortest antidromic
latencies. We conclude that Blue color signals are transmitted directly to V1
from the LGN by K-BON cells.

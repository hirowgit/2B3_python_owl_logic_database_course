INTRODUCTION: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the presence of
arboviruses from the Flavivirus genus in asymptomatic free-living non-human
primates (NHPs) living in close contact with humans and vectors in the States of 
Paraná and Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil.
METHODS: NHP sera samples (total n = 80, Alouatta spp. n = 07, Callithrix spp. n 
= 29 and Sapajus spp. n = 44) were screened for the presence of viral genomes
using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and 10% polyacrylamide gel 
electrophoresis techniques.
RESULTS: All of the samples were negative for the Flavivirus genome following the
10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: These negative results indicate that the analyzed animals were not
infected with arboviruses from the Flavivirus genus and did not represent a risk 
for viral transmission through vectors during the period in which the samples
were collected.

The γδ T cell lineage in humans remains much of an enigma due to the low number
of defined antigens, the non-canonical ways in which these cells respond to their
environment and difficulty in tracking this population in vivo. In this review,
we survey a comparative evolutionary analysis of the primate V, D and J gene
segments and contrast these findings with recent progress in defining antigen
recognition by different populations of γδ T cells in humans. Signatures of both 
purifying and diversifying selection at the Vδ and Vγ gene loci are placed into
context of Vδ1+ γδ T cell recognition of CD1d presenting different lipids, and Vγ
9Vδ2 T cell modulation by pyrophosphate-based phosphoantigens through the
butyrophilins BTN3A. From this comparison, it is clear that co-evolution between 
γδ TCRs and these ligands is likely occurring, but the diversity inherent in
these recombined receptors is an important feature in ligand surveillance.

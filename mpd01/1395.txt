Small RNAs mediate gene silencing by binding Argonaute/Piwi proteins to regulate 
target RNAs. Here, we describe small RNA profiling of the adult testes of
Callithrix jacchus, the common marmoset. The most abundant class of small RNAs in
the adult testis was piRNAs, although 353 novel miRNAs but few endo-siRNAs were
also identified. MARWI, a marmoset homolog of mouse MIWI and a very abundant PIWI
in adult testes, associates with piRNAs that show characteristics of mouse
pachytene piRNAs. As in other mammals, most marmoset piRNAs are derived from
conserved clustered regions in the genome, which are annotated as intergenic
regions. However, unlike in mice, marmoset piRNA clusters are also found on the X
chromosome, suggesting escape from meiotic sex chromosome inactivation by the
X-linked clusters. Some of the piRNA clusters identified contain
antisense-orientated pseudogenes, suggesting the possibility that
pseudogene-derived piRNAs may regulate parental functional protein-coding genes. 
More piRNAs map to transposable element (TE) subfamilies when they have copies in
piRNA clusters. In addition, the strand bias observed for piRNAs mapped to each
TE subfamily correlates with the polarity of copies inserted in clusters. These
findings suggest that pachytene piRNA clusters determine the abundance and
strand-bias of TE-derived piRNAs, may regulate protein-coding genes via
pseudogene-derived piRNAs, and may even play roles in meiosis in the adult
marmoset testis.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is considered the hepatic manifestation 
of metabolic syndrome. The more clinically concerning form of the disease,
nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), is characterized by steatosis, lobular
inflammation, and ballooning degeneration. Here we describe a naturally occurring
syndrome in the common marmoset that recapitulates the pathologic findings
associated with NAFLD/NASH in humans. Hepatomegaly determined to result from
NAFLD was observed in 33 of 183 marmosets. A comprehensive histopathologic
assessment performed in 31 marmosets demonstrated that NAFLD was characterized by
variably sized, Oil Red O staining cytoplasmic vacuoles and observed primarily in
animals with evidence of obesity and insulin resistance. A subset of marmosets
(16 of 31) also demonstrated evidence of NASH characterized by multifocal
inflammation combined with ballooning hepatocellular degeneration. Marmosets with
NASH demonstrated an increase in immunostaining with an antibody targeted against
the human leukocyte antigens (HLA)-DP, HLA-DQ, and HLA-DR compared with marmosets
without NASH (38.89 cells/10× field vs 12.05 cells/10× field, P = .05). In
addition, marmosets with NASH demonstrated increased Ki-67 immunopositive
cellular proliferation compared with those without (5.95 cells/10× field vs 1.53 
cells/10× field, P = .0002). Finally, animals with NASH demonstrated
significantly increased mean circulating serum iron levels (160.47 μg/dl, P =
.008) and an increase in numbers of Prussian blue-positive Kupffer cells (9.28
cells/40× field, P = .005) relative to marmosets without NASH (97.75 μg/dl and
1.87 cells/40×, respectively). This study further characterizes the
histopathology of NAFLD/NASH and suggests that the marmoset may be a valuable
animal model with which to investigate the host and environmental factors
contributing to the progression of NAFLD/ NASH.

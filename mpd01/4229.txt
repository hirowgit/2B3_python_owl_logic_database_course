The distribution of the binding of [3H]GR65630 (0.2 nM) to putative 5-HT3
recognition sites in the brain of the common marmoset was assessed using
autoradiography. Specific binding was heterogeneously distributed with the
highest densities found in discrete nuclei of the lower medulla (nucleus tractus 
solitarii, dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve, nucleus of spinal trigeminal 
nerve tract and the area postrema). In forebrain areas, relatively high binding
densities were located in the medial habenula nucleus and the hippocampus (CA3,
CA4 and fascia dentata). Low levels of specific binding in the rest of the
forebrain hindered quantification.

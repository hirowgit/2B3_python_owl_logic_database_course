Sphingolipids and enzymes of the sphingolipid rheostat determine synaptic
appearance and signaling in the brain, but sphingolipid contribution to normal
behavioral plasticity is little understood. Here we asked how the sphingolipid
rheostat contributes to learning and memory of various dimensions. We
investigated the role of these lipids in the mechanisms of two different types of
memory, such as appetitively and aversively motivated memory, which are
considered to be mediated by different neural mechanisms. We found an association
between superior performance in short- and long-term appetitively motivated
learning and regionally enhanced neutral sphingomyelinase (NSM) activity. An
opposite interaction was observed in an aversively motivated task. A
valence-dissociating role of NSM in learning was confirmed in mice with
genetically reduced NSM activity. This role may be mediated by the NSM control of
N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor subunit expression. In a translational approach, we
confirmed a positive association of serum NSM activity with long-term
appetitively motivated memory in nonhuman primates and in healthy humans.
Altogether, these data suggest a new sphingolipid mechanism of de-novo learning
and memory, which is based on NSM activity.

Perceptual sensitivity varies from moment to moment. One potential source of this
variability is spontaneous fluctuations in cortical activity that can travel as
waves1. Spontaneous travelling waves have been reported during anaesthesia2-7,
but it is not known whether they have a role during waking perception. Here,
using newly developed analytic techniques to characterize the moment-to-moment
dynamics of noisy multielectrode data, we identify spontaneous waves of activity 
in the extrastriate visual cortex of awake, behaving marmosets (Callithrix
jacchus). In monkeys trained to detect faint visual targets, the timing and
position of spontaneous travelling waves before target onset predicted the
magnitude of target-evoked activity and the likelihood of target detection. By
contrast, spatially disorganized fluctuations of neural activity were much less
predictive. These results reveal an important role for spontaneous travelling
waves in sensory processing through the modulation of neural and perceptual
sensitivity.

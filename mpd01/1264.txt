Slow brain rhythms are attributed to near-simultaneous (synchronous) changes in
activity in neuron populations in the brain. Because they are slow and
widespread, synchronous rhythms have not been considered crucial for information 
processing in the waking state. Here we adapted methods from turbulence physics
to analyze δ-band (1-4 Hz) rhythms in local field potential (LFP) activity, in
multielectrode recordings from cerebral cortex in anesthetized marmoset monkeys. 
We found that synchrony contributes only a small fraction (less than one-fourth) 
to the local spatiotemporal structure of δ-band signals. Rather, δ-band activity 
is dominated by propagating plane waves and spatiotemporal structures, which we
call complex waves. Complex waves are manifest at submillimeter spatial scales,
and millisecond-range temporal scales. We show that complex waves can be
characterized by their relation to phase singularities within local nerve cell
networks. We validate the biological relevance of complex waves by showing that
nerve cell spike rates are higher in presence of complex waves than in the
presence of synchrony and that there are nonrandom patterns of evolution from one
type of complex wave to another. We conclude that slow brain rhythms
predominantly indicate spatiotemporally organized activity in local nerve cell
circuits, not synchronous activity within and across brain regions.

Groundbreaking studies showed that differentiated somatic cells of mouse and
human origin could be reverted to a stable pluripotent state by the ectopic
expression of only four proteins. The resulting pluripotent cells, called induced
pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, could be an alternative to embryonic stem cells,
which are under continuous ethical debate. Hence, iPS cell-derived functional
cells such as neurons may become the key for an effective treatment of currently 
incurable degenerative diseases. However, besides the requirement of efficacy
testing of the therapy also its long-term safety needs to be carefully evaluated 
in settings mirroring the clinical situation in an optimal way. In this context, 
we chose the long-lived common marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus) as a
non-human primate species to generate iPS cells. The marmoset monkey is
frequently used in biomedical research and is gaining more and more preclinical
relevance due to the increasing number of disease models. Here, we describe, to
our knowledge, the first-time generation of marmoset monkey iPS cells from
postnatal skin fibroblasts by non-viral means. We used the transposon-based,
fully reversible piggyback system. We cloned the marmoset monkey reprogramming
factors and established robust and reproducible reprogramming protocols with a
six-factor-in-one-construct approach. We generated six individual iPS cell lines 
and characterized them in comparison with marmoset monkey embryonic stem cells.
The generated iPS cells are morphologically indistinguishable from marmoset ES
cells. The iPS cells are fully reprogrammed as demonstrated by differentiation
assays, pluripotency marker expression and transcriptome analysis. They are
stable for numerous passages (more than 80) and exhibit euploidy. In summary, we 
have established efficient non-viral reprogramming protocols for the derivation
of stable marmoset monkey iPS cells, which can be used to develop and test cell
replacement therapies in preclinical settings.

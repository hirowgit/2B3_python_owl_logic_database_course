BACKGROUND: Common marmosets are known to develop an IgM glomerulopathy, which
has been linked with 'wasting marmoset' syndrome. This study investigated renal
pathology in a colony of marmosets, with and without weight loss.
METHODS: Renal histology, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy were
performed on marmosets euthanized for research or for weight loss. Serum and
urine biochemistry were measured during life and at euthanasia.
RESULTS: Histology from 25 adult marmosets (19 research and 6 weight loss) showed
mesangial expansion in the majority of glomeruli. Mesangial changes correlated
with electron-dense deposits and IgM deposition by immunofluorescence; negligible
other pathology was seen. Glomerular basement membrane thickness appeared
increased compared to reported human measurements. Low-grade proteinuria was
present in all animals, but did not progress. Renal function was normal in all
animals.
CONCLUSIONS: Marmosets develop a glomerulopathy characterized by mesangial
expansion, IgM deposition, and proteinuria. This is a benign occurrence and not
specifically associated with weight loss.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a non-human primate that could prove 
useful as human pharmacokinetic and biomedical research models. The cytochromes
P450 (P450s) are a superfamily of enzymes that have critical roles in drug
metabolism and disposition via monooxygenation of a broad range of xenobiotics;
however, information on some marmoset P450s is currently limited. Therefore,
identification and quantitative analysis of tissue-specific mRNA transcripts,
including those of P450s and flavin-containing monooxygenases (FMO, another
monooxygenase family), need to be carried out in detail before the marmoset can
be used as an animal model in drug development. De novo assembly and expression
analysis of marmoset transcripts were conducted with pooled liver, intestine,
kidney, and brain samples from three male and three female marmosets. After
unique sequences were automatically aligned by assembling software, the mean
contig length was 718 bp (with a standard deviation of 457 bp) among a total of
47,883 transcripts. Approximately 30% of the total transcripts were matched to
known marmoset sequences. Gene expression in 18 marmoset P450- and 4 FMO-like
genes displayed some tissue-specific patterns. Of these, the three most highly
expressed in marmoset liver were P450 2D-, 2E-, and 3A-like genes. In
extrahepatic tissues, including brain, gene expressions of these monooxygenases
were lower than those in liver, although P450 3A4 (previously P450 3A21) in
intestine and P450 4A11- and FMO1-like genes in kidney were relatively highly
expressed. By means of massive parallel long-read sequencing and short-read
technology applied to marmoset liver, intestine, kidney, and brain, the combined 
next-generation sequencing analyses reported here were able to identify novel
marmoset drug-metabolizing P450 transcripts that have until now been little
reported. These results provide a foundation for mechanistic studies and pave the
way for the use of marmosets as model animals for drug development in the future.

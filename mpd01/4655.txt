[Morphologic findings in experimental non-A, non-B hepatitis].

[Article in German]

Dienes HP.

A report is given about light and electron microscopy in primates with
experimental hepatitis non-A-non-B; own data are presented as well as data from
the literature. Morphological changes after infection with GB, NANB and Delta-AG 
are discussed. Light microscopy in these animal models shows a similar pattern of
lesions as can be found in human hepatitis; however, in these models
ultrastructural changes have been observed, whose specifity has not yet been
confirmed.

Identification of different subpopulations of neostriatal neurones projecting to 
globus pallidus or substantia nigra in the monkey: a retrograde fluorescence
double-labelling study.

FÃ©ger J, Crossman AR.

Fluorescent tracers (Nuclear Yellow, True Blue, Fast Blue) were injected, in
various combinations, into the globus pallidus and substantia nigra in three
marmosets. Examination of perikarya in the ipsilateral neostriatum, well removed 
from pallidal injection sites, revealed that the predominant pattern was of
single-labelled cells, retrogradely labelled from either the globus pallidus or
substantia nigra. It is suggested, on the basis of this evidence and data
previously available, that the striatum contains at least three types of efferent
neurones, one projecting exclusively to the globus pallidus, one projecting
exclusively to the substantia nigra, and another projecting to both structures.

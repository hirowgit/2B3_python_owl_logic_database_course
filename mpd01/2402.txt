In vivo hypothalamic gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) release was
characterised for the first time in a New World primate. A nonterminal and
repeatable push-pull perfusion (PPP) technique reliably measured GnRH in
conscious common marmoset monkeys. Nineteen adult females (n = 8 ovary-intact in 
the mid-follicular phase; n = 11 ovariectomised) were fitted with long-term
cranial pedestals, and a push-pull cannula was temporarily placed in unique
locations within the pituitary stalk-median eminence (S-ME) 2 days prior to each 
PPP session. Marmosets underwent 1-3 PPPs (32 PPPs in total) lasting up to 12 h. 
Plasma cortisol levels were not elevated in these habituated marmosets during
PPP, and PPP did not disrupt ovulatory cyclicity or subsequent fertility in
ovary-intact females. GnRH displayed an organised pattern of release, with pulses
occurring every 50.0 +/- 2.6 min and lasting 25.4 +/- 1.3 min. GnRH pulse
frequency was consistent within individual marmosets across multiple PPPs. GnRH
mean concentration, baseline concentration and pulse amplitude varied predictably
with anatomical location of the cannula tip within the S-ME. GnRH release
increased characteristically in response to a norepinephrine infusion and
decreased abruptly during the evening transition to lights off. Ovary-intact
(mid-follicular phase) and ovariectomised marmosets did not differ significantly 
on any parameter of GnRH release. Overall, these results indicate that PPP can be
used to reliably assess in vivo GnRH release in marmosets and will be a useful
tool for future studies of reproductive neuroendocrinology in this small primate.

Measles virus (MeV) research is largely dependent on the B95a cell line, which is
derived from marmoset B lymphocytes. As this cell line is persistently infected
with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a novel cell line, COBL-a, was established from
human umbilical cord blood. COBL-a cells have a significant advantage over B95a
cells because they are of human origin, are free from EBV and have higher
sensitivity to wild-type MeV. Thus, COBL-a cells should prove very valuable for
both epidemiological and basic studies of MeV.

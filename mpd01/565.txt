Neurological compensatory mechanisms help our brain to adjust to
neurodegeneration as in Parkinson's disease. It is suggested that the
compensation of the damaged striato-thalamo-cortical circuit is focused on the
intact thalamo-rubro-cerebellar pathway as seen during presymptomatic Parkinson, 
paradoxical movement and sensorimotor rhythm (SMR). Indeed, the size of the red
nucleus, connecting the cerebellum with the cerebral cortex, is larger in
Parkinson's disease patients suggesting an increased activation of this brain
area. Therefore, the red nucleus was examined in MPTP-induced parkinsonian
marmoset monkeys during the presymptomatic stage and after SMR activation by
neurofeedback training. We found a reverse significant correlation between the
early expression of parkinsonian signs and the size of the parvocellular part of 
the red nucleus, which is predominantly present in human and non-human primates. 
In quadrupedal animals it consists mainly of the magnocellular part. Furthermore,
SMR activation, that mitigated parkinsonian signs, further increased the size of 
the red nucleus in the marmoset monkey. This plasticity of the brain helps to
compensate for dysfunctional movement control and can be a promising target for
compensatory treatment with neurofeedback technology, vibrotactile stimulation or
DBS in order to improve the quality of life for Parkinson's disease patients.

Effective antiviral treatments for MERS-CoV are urgently needed. LCA60 is a
MERS-CoV-neutralizing monoclonal antibody isolated from a convalescent MERS
patient. Previously, it was shown that treatment with LCA60 resulted in reduced
disease and virus titers in mouse models of MERS-CoV infection. Here, we tested
the prophylactic efficacy of LCA60 in the common marmoset model of MERS-CoV
infection. Intravenous administration of LCA60 one day before virus challenge
resulted in high levels of MERS-CoV-neutralizing activity in circulating blood.
Clinically, there was a moderate benefit of treatment with LCA60 including
reduced respiratory involvement. Although viral lung loads were not reduced in
LCA60-treated animals as compared to controls, there were fewer pathological
changes in the lungs. Thus, prophylactic LCA60 treatment could be implemented to 
reduce disease burden in contacts of confirmed MERS-CoV patients.

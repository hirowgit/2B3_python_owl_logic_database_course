Lipid composition of marmoset saliva.

Murty VL, Slomiany BL, Zdebska E, Slomiany A, Mandel ID, Levy M.

The lipid content and composition of marmoset saliva was investigated. Extraction
of the dialyzed and lyophilized saliva with chloroform/methanol yielded 15.6 +/- 
3.1 mg of lipids/100 ml of saliva. Of the total lipids, 41.7% were represented by
neutral lipids, 50.7% by glycolipids and 7.6% by phospholipids. Neutral lipids
had a high content of free fatty acids (67.0%), cholesterol and its esters
(20.0%) and triglycerides (11.8%). The glycolipid fraction was comprised of
simple glycosphingolipids (13.2%), and of neutral and sulfated glyceroglucolipids
(86.8%), whereas sphingomyelin, phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine 
accounted for 63.6% of the total phospholipids. The results indicate that
marmoset saliva, in comparison to that of human, contains twice as much of total 
lipids and exhibits an elevated level of phospholipids, and glycolipids.

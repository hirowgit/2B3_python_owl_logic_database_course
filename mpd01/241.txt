The domestication syndrome refers to a set of traits that are the by-products of 
artificial selection for increased tolerance toward humans [1-3]. One hypothesis 
is that some species, like humans and bonobos, "self-domesticated" and have been 
under selection for that same suite of domesticated phenotypes [4-8]. However,
the evidence for this has been largely circumstantial. Here, we provide evidence 
that, in marmoset monkeys, the size of a domestication phenotype-a white facial
fur patch-is linked to their degree of affiliative vocal responding. During
development, the amount of parental vocal feedback experienced influences the
rate of growth of this facial white patch, and this suggests a mechanistic link
between the two phenotypes, possibly via neural crest cells. Our study provides
evidence for links between vocal behavior and the development of morphological
phenotypes associated with domestication in a nonhuman primate.

The ability to generate in vitro cultures of neuronal cells has been instrumental
in advancing our understanding of the nervous system. Rodent models have been the
principal source of brain cells used in primary cultures for over a century,
providing insights that are widely applicable to human diseases. However,
therapeutic agents that showed benefit in rodent models, particularly those
pertaining to aging and age-associated dementias, have frequently failed in
clinical trials. This discrepancy established a potential "translational gap"
between human and rodent studies that may at least partially be explained by the 
phylogenetic distance between rodent and primate species. Several non-human
primate (NHP) species, including the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), have
been used extensively in neuroscience research, but in contrast to rodent models,
practical approaches to the generation of primary cell culture systems amenable
to molecular studies that can inform in vivo studies are lacking. Marmosets are a
powerful model in biomedical research and particularly in studies of aging and
age-associated diseases because they exhibit an aging phenotype similar to
humans. Here, we report a practical method to culture primary marmoset neurons
and astrocytes from brains of medically euthanized postnatal day 0 (P0) marmoset 
newborns that yield highly pure primary neuron and astrocyte cultures. Primary
marmoset neuron and astrocyte cultures can be generated reliably to provide a
powerful NHP in vitro model in neuroscience research that may enable mechanistic 
studies of nervous system aging and of age-related neurodegenerative disorders.
Because neuron and astrocyte cultures can be used in combination with in vivo
approaches in marmosets, primary marmoset neuron and astrocyte cultures may help 
bridge the current translational gap between basic and clinical studies in
nervous system aging and age-associated neurological diseases.

Over the past few decades, MRI-based visualization of demyelinated CNS lesions
has become pivotal to the diagnosis and monitoring of multiple sclerosis (MS). In
this Review, we outline current efforts to correlate imaging findings with the
pathology of lesion development in MS, and the pitfalls that are being
encountered in this research. Multimodal imaging at high and ultra-high magnetic 
field strengths is yielding biologically relevant insights into the
pathophysiology of blood-brain barrier dynamics and both active and chronic
inflammation, as well as mechanisms of lesion healing and remyelination. Here, we
parallel the results in humans with advances in imaging of a primate model of MS 
- experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in the common marmoset - in
which demyelinated lesions resemble their human counterparts far more closely
than do EAE lesions in the rodent. This approach holds promise for the
identification of innovative biological markers, and for next-generation clinical
trials that will focus more on tissue protection and repair.

Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors have been a powerful gene delivery vehicle
to the retina for basic research and gene therapy. For many of these
applications, achieving cell type-specific targeting and high transduction
efficiency is desired. Recently, there has been increasing interest in
AAV-mediated gene targeting to specific retinal bipolar cell types. A 200-bp
enhancer in combination with a basal SV40 promoter has been commonly used to
target transgenes into ON-type bipolar cells. In the current study, we searched
for additional cis-regulatory elements in the mGluR6 gene for improving
AAV-mediated transduction efficiency into retinal bipolar cells. Our results
showed that the combination of the endogenous mGluR6 promoter with additional
enhancers in the introns of the mGluR6 gene markedly enhanced AAV transduction
efficiency as well as made the targeting more selective for rod bipolar cells in 
mice. Furthermore, the AAV vectors with the improved promoter could target to ON 
bipolar cells with robust transduction efficiency in the parafovea and the far
peripheral retina of marmoset monkeys. The improved mGluR6 promoter constructs
could provide a valuable tool for genetic manipulation in rod bipolar cells in
mice and facilitate clinical applications for ON bipolar cell-based gene
therapies.

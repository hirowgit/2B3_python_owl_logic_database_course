Functional patterns of molar occlusion in platyrrhine primates.

Rosenberger AL, Kinzey WG.

Mechanico-functional features of molar form were studied in Callithrix, Alouatta,
Pithecia and Cebus. Molars of Callithrix and Alouatta are adapted to loading
foods under relatively high occlusal pressure; those of Pithecia and Cebus, under
relatively low occlusal pressure. General functional considerations suggest that 
these taxa are adapted to insectivorous, folivorous, frugivorous and omnivorous
diets, respectively. The physical properties of foods, principally mechanical
strength and deformability, determine the selective pressures involved in the
evolutionary adaptation of molar form. A dietary classification based upon
percentages of foods eaten does not always reflect morphological adaptations.
Homologous parts of teeth and homologous parts of the masticatory cycle do not
always subserve equivalent functions. The relevance of functional occlusal
analysis for deciphering phylogeny and explaining evolutionary grades is
stressed.

Skeletal development in the foetal and neonatal marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).

Phillips IR.

Qualitative and quantitative measurements of skeletal development were performed 
on foetal marmosets in utero and on fixed specimens of both foetuses and
neonates. The sequence of skeletal changes may be used to assess developmental
status and the prenatal growth of the marmoset is compared with that of other
primate species.

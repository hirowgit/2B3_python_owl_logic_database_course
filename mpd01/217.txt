Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common cause of cancer-related deaths largely due to
CRC liver metastasis (CRLM). Identification of targetable mechanisms continues
and includes investigations into the role of inflammatory pathways. Of interest, 
MAPK is aberrantly expressed in CRC patients, yet the activation status is not
defined. The present study assessed p38γ activation in CRC patients, cancer
cells, and tissues of cotton top tamarin (CTT) and common marmoset (CM). The
primate world is an overlooked resource as colitis-CRC-prone CTT are usually
inure to liver metastasis while CM develop colitis but not CRC. The results
demonstrate that p38γ protein and phosphorylation levels are significantly
increased in CRC patients compared to normal subjects and CTT. Furthermore, p38γ 
phosphorylation is significantly elevated in human CRC cells and hepatoblastoma
cells but not in CM colon. Additionally, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and
biliary glycoprotein (BGP) are induced in the CRC patients that showed p38γ
phosphorylation. Inhibition of p38 MAPK in CRC cells showed a significant decline
in cell growth with no effect on apoptosis or BGP level. Overall, p38γ is
activated in CRC tumorigenesis and likely involves CEA antigens during CRLM in
humans but not in the CTT or CM, that rarely develop CRLM.

In rodents, innate and learned fear of predators depends on the medial
hypothalamic defensive system, a conserved brain network that lies downstream of 
the amygdala and promotes avoidance via projections to the periaqueductal gray.
Whether this network is involved in primate fear remains unknown. To address
this, we provoked flight responses to a predator (moving snake) in the marmoset
monkey under laboratory conditions. We combined c-Fos immunolabeling and
anterograde/retrograde tracing to map the functional connectivity of the
ventromedial hypothalamus, a core node in the medial hypothalamic defensive
system. Our findings demonstrate that the ventromedial hypothalamus is recruited 
by predator exposure in primates and that anatomical connectivity of the rodent
and primate medial hypothalamic defensive system are highly conserved.

BACKGROUND: Non-human primates (NHPs) are susceptible to dogs' attacks, events
that may cause muscle damage along with stress, and could be in some extent
compatible with capture myopathy, a syndrome that results in myoglobinuria and
renal damage.
METHODS: We aimed to evaluate by histopathology pre-existing lesions and
subsequent sequelae related to dogs' attacks, acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and
myoglobinuria, as well as the usefulness of Pearls Stain and IHC to diagnose it. 
Histopathology was performed in available organs, and sections of kidney
submitted to Prussian blue stain and myoglobin immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: During January 2014-June 2016, 16/145 (11%) of NHPs received by Adolfo
Lutz Institute, Brazil were reported as attacked by dogs. A high frequency of
young and debilitated animals was found. Myoglobinuria was observed in more than 
half animals (9/16; 56.2%), from which (5/9; 55.5%) presented ATN.
CONCLUSIONS: Kidney lesions are plausible findings in NHPs attacked by dogs.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating, autoimmune disease of the central
nervous system. While work has focused on myelin and axon loss in MS, less is
known about mechanisms underlying synaptic changes. Using postmortem human MS
tissue, a preclinical nonhuman primate model of MS, and two rodent models of
demyelinating disease, we investigated synapse changes in the visual system.
Similar to other neurodegenerative diseases, microglial synaptic engulfment and
profound synapse loss were observed. In mice, synapse loss occurred independently
of local demyelination and neuronal degeneration but coincided with gliosis and
increased complement component C3, but not C1q, at synapses. Viral overexpression
of the complement inhibitor Crry at C3-bound synapses decreased microglial
engulfment of synapses and protected visual function. These results indicate that
microglia eliminate synapses through the alternative complement cascade in
demyelinating disease and identify a strategy to prevent synapse loss that may be
broadly applicable to other neurodegenerative diseases. VIDEO ABSTRACT.

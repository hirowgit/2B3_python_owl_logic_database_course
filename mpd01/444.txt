Knock-in (KI) gene targeting can be employed for a wide range of applications in 
stem cell research. However, vectors for KI require multiple complicated
processes for construction, including multiple times of digestion/ligation steps 
and extensive restriction mapping, which has imposed limitations for the robust
applicability of KI gene targeting. To circumvent this issue, here we introduce
versatile and systematic methods for generating KI vectors by molecular cloning. 
In this approach, we employed the Multisite Gateway technology, an efficient in
vitro DNA recombination system using proprietary sequences and enzymes. KI vector
construction exploiting these methods requires only efficient steps, such as PCR 
and recombination, enabling robust KI gene targeting. We show that combinatorial 
usage of the KI vectors generated using this method and site-specific nucleases
enabled the precise integration of fluorescent protein genes in multiple loci of 
human and common marmoset (marmoset; Callithrix jacchus) pluripotent stem cells. 
The methods described here will facilitate the usage of KI technology and
ultimately help to accelerate stem cell research.

Three field seasons of exploration along the Río Alto Madre de Dios in Peruvian
Amazonia have yielded a fauna of micromammals from a new locality AMD-45, at
∼12.8°S. So far we have identified the new primate described here as well as
small caviomorph rodents, cenolestoid marsupials, interatheriid notoungulates,
xenarthrans, fish, lizards and invertebrates. The site is in the Bala Formation
as exposed where the river transects a syncline. U-Pb dates on detrital zircons
constrain the locality's age at between 17.1 ± 0.7 Ma and 18.9 ± 0.7 Ma, making
the fauna age-equivalent to that from the Pinturas Formation and the older parts 
of the Santa Cruz Formation of Patagonian Argentina (Santacrucian). The primate
specimen is an unworn M1 of exceptionally small size (equivalent in size to the
extant callitrichine, Callithrix jacchus, among the smallest living platyrrhines 
and the smallest Eocene-Early Miocene platyrrhine yet recorded). Despite its
small size it is unlike extant callitrichines in having a prominent cingulum
hypocone. Based on the moderate development of the buccal crests, this animal
likely had a diet similar to that of frugivorous callitrichines, and distinctly
different from the more similarly-sized gummivores, Cebuella and C. jacchus. The 
phyletic position of the new taxon is uncertain, especially given the
autapomorphic character of the tooth as a whole. Nevertheless, its unusual
morphology hints at a wholly original and hitherto unknown Amazonian fauna, and
reinforces the impression of the geographic separation of the Amazonian tropics
from the more geographically isolated southerly parts of the continent in Early
Miocene times.

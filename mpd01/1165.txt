Manganese-enhanced MRI (MEMRI) has been described as a powerful tool to depict
the architecture of neuronal circuits. In this study we investigated the
potential use of in vivo MRI detection of manganese for tracing neuronal
projections from the primary motor cortex (M1) in healthy marmosets (Callithrix
Jacchus). We determined the optimal dose of manganese chloride (MnCl2) among 800,
400, 40 and 8 nmol that led to manganese-induced hyperintensity furthest from the
injection site, as specific to the corticospinal tract as possible, and that
would not induce motor deficit. A commonly available 3T human clinical MRI
scanner and human knee coil were used to follow hyperintensity in the
corticospinal tract 24h after injection. A statistical parametric map of seven
marmosets injected with the chosen dose, 8 nmol, showed the corticospinal tract
and M1 connectivity with the basal ganglia, substantia nigra and thalamus. Safety
was determined for the lowest dose that did not induce dexterity and grip
strength deficit, and no behavioral effects could be seen in marmosets who
received multiple injections of manganese one month apart. In conclusion, our
study shows for the first time in marmosets, a reliable and reproducible way to
perform longitudinal ME-MRI experiments to observe the integrity of the marmoset 
corticospinal tract on a clinical 3T MRI scanner.

BACKGROUND: Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in the common
marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus) is a relevant preclinical model for
translational research into immunopathogenic mechanisms operating in multiple
sclerosis (MS). Prior studies showed a core pathogenic role of T and B cells
specific for myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG). However, in those
studies, the quality of the response against MOG epitopes was strongly biased by 
bacterial antigens in the complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA), in which the
immunizing recombinant human (rh) MOG protein had been formulated. In response to
the need of a more refined EAE model, we have tested whether disease could also
be induced with rhMOG in incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA).
METHOD: Marmosets were immunized with rhMOG emulsified in IFA in the dorsal skin.
Monkeys that did not develop neurological deficit were given booster
immunizations at 28-day interval with the same antigen preparation. In a second
experiment, three marmoset twin pairs were sensitized against MOG peptides in IFA
to study a possibility for suppressive activity towards pathogenic T cells
directed against the encephalitogenic epitope MOG40-48.
RESULTS: Despite the absence of strong danger signals in the rhMOG/IFA inoculum, 
all monkeys developed clinically evident EAE symptoms. Moreover, in all monkeys, 
demyelinated lesions were present in the white matter and in two cases also in
the cortical grey matter. Immune profiling at height of the disease showed a
dominant T cell response against the overlapping peptides 14-36 and 24-46, but
reactivity against the pathogenically most relevant peptide 34-56 was
conspicuously absent. In the second experiment, there was an indication for a
possible suppressive mechanism.
CONCLUSIONS: Immunization of marmoset monkeys with rhMOG in IFA elicits clinical 
EAE in all animals. Moreover, rhMOG contains pathogenic and regulatory epitopes, 
but the pathogenic hierarchy of rhMOG epitopes is strongly influenced by the
adjuvant in which the protein is formulated.

A technique for measurement of respiration-based lung deposition of an aerosol
was investigated and subsequently applied in a pilot study with a marmoset
monkey. The technique consisted of an aerosol exposure system for a marmoset
using a face mask and a previously constructed monkey chair, a method for
recovery of fluorescent dextrane from lung material, and respiration measurement 
of the marmoset by whole-body plethysmography. In the pilot study, a
ketamine-anesthetized marmoset was exposed for 20 min to an FITC-dextrane aerosol
atmosphere (200 microg/L air, particle size 1.5 microm mass median aerodynamic
diameter [MMAD]). It was found that 3.4% of the inhaled aerosol was deposited in 
the lungs; the aerosol was distributed over the lung lobes with an higher
concentration at the distal side.

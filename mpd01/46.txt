BACKGROUND: Retroviruses utilize multiple unique RNA elements to control RNA
processing and translation. However, it is unclear what functional RNA elements
are present in endogenous retroviruses (ERVs). Gene co-option from ERVs sometimes
entails the conservation of viral cis-elements required for gene expression,
which might reveal the RNA regulation in ERVs.
RESULTS: Here, we characterized an RNA element found in ERVs consisting of three 
specific sequence motifs, called SPRE. The SPRE-like elements were found in
different ERV families but not in any exogenous viral sequences examined. We
observed more than a thousand of copies of the SPRE-like elements in several
mammalian genomes; in human and marmoset genomes, they overlapped with
lineage-specific ERVs. SPRE was originally found in human syncytin-1 and
syncytin-2. Indeed, several mammalian syncytin genes: mac-syncytin-3 of macaque, 
syncytin-Ten1 of tenrec, and syncytin-Car1 of Carnivora, contained the SPRE-like 
elements. A reporter assay revealed that the enhancement of gene expression by
SPRE depended on the reporter genes. Mutation of SPRE impaired the wild-type
syncytin-2 expression while the same mutation did not affect codon-optimized
syncytin-2, suggesting that SPRE activity depends on the coding sequence.
CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate multiple independent invasions of various
mammalian genomes by retroviruses harboring SPRE-like elements. Functional
SPRE-like elements are found in several syncytin genes derived from these
retroviruses. This element may facilitate the expression of viral genes, which
were suppressed due to inefficient codon frequency or repressive elements within 
the coding sequences. These findings provide new insights into the long-term
evolution of RNA elements and molecular mechanisms of gene expression in
retroviruses.

BACKGROUND: In vitro follicular maturation (IVFM) of ovarian follicles is an
emerging option for fertility preservation. Many paracrine factors and
two-dimensional or three-dimensional (3D) environments have been used for
optimization. However, since most studies were conducted using the murine model, 
the physiological differences between mice and humans limit the interpretation
and adaptation of the results. Marmoset monkey is a non-human primate (NHPs) with
more similar reproductive physiology to humans. In this study, we attempted to
establish a 3D matrix (Matrtigel)-based IVFM condition for marmoset ovarian
follicles in combination with anti-apoptotic factor, X-linked inhibitor of
apoptosis protein (XIAP).
METHODS: Marmoset follicles were isolated as individual follicles and cultured in
a single drop with the addition of 0, 10, and 100 μg/mL of XIAP molecules.
Matured oocytes and granulosa cells from mature follicles were collected and
analyzed. The average number of isolated follicles was less than 100, and
primordial and antral follicles were abundant in the ovaries.
RESULTS: IVFM of marmoset follicles in 3D matrix conditions with XIAP increased
the rates of survival and in vitro follicle development. Furthermore, oocytes
from the 3D cultures were successfully fertilized and developed in vitro. The
addition of XIAP increased the secretion of estradiol and aromatase. Furthermore,
expression of granulosa-specific genes, such as bone morphogenetic protein 15,
Oct4, and follicle-stimulating hormone receptor were upregulated in the in
vitro-matured follicles than in normal, well-grown, and atretic follicles.
Apoptosis-related B-cell lymphoma-2 was highly expressed in the atretic follicles
than in the XIAP-treated follicles, and higher caspase-3 was localized in the
XIAP-treated follicles.
CONCLUSION: In this study, we attempted to establish a 3D-matrix-based marmoset
IVFM condition and demonstrated the synergistic effects of XIAP. The use of a 3D 
matrix may be applied as an optimal culture condition for marmoset ovarian
follicles.

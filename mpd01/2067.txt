Developmental and reproductive toxicology testing in nonhuman primates (NHPs) has
become more common due to the increasing number of biopharmaceuticals in drug
development, since NHPs are frequently the only species to express pharmacologic 
responses similar to humans. NHPs may also be used to help resolve issues
associated with small-molecule reproductive toxicology in traditional species
(rodents and rabbits). Adequate designs in NHP are presented for developmental
toxicity (embryo-fetal development, pre-postnatal development, enhanced
pre-postnatal development), reproductive toxicity (male and female), and juvenile
toxicity studies. Optional parameters that may be included in these studies are
discussed, as are new study designs that consolidate multiple aspects of the
reproductive assessment and thereby conserve the limited supply of sexually
mature NHPs available for testing. The details described will assist scientists
in pharmaceutical, regulatory, and contract research organizations who are
involved in conducting these unique studies to optimize their design based on
case-by-case considerations.

BACKGROUND: Animals in captivity should receive adequate sunlight exposure for
sufficient generation of vitamin D [25(OH)D]. In the present study, 25(OH)D serum
levels of 84 Callithrix penicillata primates were evaluated.
OBJECTIVES: To determine 25(OH)D levels of those animals; to evaluate the
influence of gender and period of sunlight exposure on their 25(OH)D levels.
METHODS: Three groups were evaluated: group 1 (n = 29) on free sunlight exposure;
group 2 (n = 34) on partial sunlight exposure; group 3 (n = 21) without sunlight 
exposure.
RESULTS: The obtained 25(OH)D values were: group 1, 121.2 +/- 33.3 ng/ml; group
2, 115.2 +/- 32.2 ng/ml; group 3, 53.3 +/- 10.4 ng/ml. Significant statistical
differences were obtained between groups 1 and 3 (p < 0.001) and groups 2 and 3
(p < 0.001); no statistical difference was found between genders.
CONCLUSION: Direct sunlight exposure is essential for 25(OH)D sufficiency and it 
is proposed that the 25(OH)D normal range for captive Callithrix penicillata
would be from 104.8 to 137.1 ng/ml (CI = 95%).

Viruses express several classes of non-coding RNAs; the functions and mechanisms 
by which most of these act are unknown. Herpesvirus saimiri, a Î³-herpesvirus that
establishes latency in the T cells of New World primates and has the ability to
cause aggressive leukaemias and lymphomas in non-natural hosts, expresses seven
small nuclear uracil-rich non-coding RNAs (called HSURs) in latently infected
cells. These HSURs associate with Sm proteins, and share biogenesis and
structural features with cellular Sm-class small nuclear RNAs. One of these HSURs
(HSUR2) base-pairs with two host cellular microRNAs (miR-142-3p and miR-16) but
does not affect their abundance or activity, which suggests that its interactions
with them perform alternative functions. Here we show that HSUR2 also base-pairs 
with mRNAs in infected cells. We combined in vivo psoralen-mediated RNA-RNA
crosslinking and high-throughput sequencing to identify the mRNAs targeted by
HSUR2, which include mRNAs that encode retinoblastoma and factors involved in p53
signalling and apoptosis. We show that HSUR2 represses the expression of target
mRNAs and that base-pairing between HSUR2 and miR-142-3p and miR-16 is essential 
for this repression, suggesting that HSUR2 recruits these two cellular microRNAs 
to its target mRNAs. Furthermore, we show that HSUR2 uses this mechanism to
inhibit apoptosis. Our results uncover a role for this viral Sm-class RNA as a
microRNA adaptor in the regulation of gene expression that follows precursor mRNA
processing.

Here, we report the existence of meningeal lymphatic vessels in human and
nonhuman primates (common marmoset monkeys) and the feasibility of noninvasively 
imaging and mapping them in vivo with high-resolution, clinical MRI. On T2-FLAIR 
and T1-weighted black-blood imaging, lymphatic vessels enhance with gadobutrol, a
gadolinium-based contrast agent with high propensity to extravasate across a
permeable capillary endothelial barrier, but not with gadofosveset, a blood-pool 
contrast agent. The topography of these vessels, running alongside dural venous
sinuses, recapitulates the meningeal lymphatic system of rodents. In primates,
meningeal lymphatics display a typical panel of lymphatic endothelial markers by 
immunohistochemistry. This discovery holds promise for better understanding the
normal physiology of lymphatic drainage from the central nervous system and
potential aberrations in neurological diseases.

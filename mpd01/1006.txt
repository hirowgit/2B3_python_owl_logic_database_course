Common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) are frequently used for biomedical research
but can be afflicted with diarrhea-a serious and potentially lethal health
problem. Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) is thought to be the causative 
pathogen of hemorrhagic typhlocolitis in common marmosets, but the actual
incidence of the disease and the relationship between EPEC and hematochezia are
unknown. This study investigated the prevalence of EPEC infection in common
marmosets and the association between EPEC and hematochezia. A total of 230 stool
or rectal swab samples were collected from 230 common marmosets (98 clinically
healthy, 85 diarrhea, and 47 bloody stool samples) and tested by culture-based
detection and PCR amplification of VT1, VT2, LT, ST, eae, and bfp genes. Healthy 
animals were divided into three groups (n = 4 each for high and low concentration
groups and n = 2 as negative control), and those in the experimental groups were 
perorally inoculated with a 2-ml of suspension of EPEC R811 strain adjusted to 5 
× 108 (high concentration) and 5 × 104 (low concentration) CFU/ ml. Two animals
in each group were examined 3 and 14 days post-inoculation (DPI). EPEC was
detected in 10 of 98 clinically healthy samples (10.2%), 17 of 85 diarrhea
samples (20%), and all 47 bloody stool samples (100%), with a significant
difference detected between presence of EPEC and sample status (P < 0.01). Acute 
hematochezia was observed in all animals of the high-concentration group but not 
in other groups at 1 or 2 DPI. A histopathological examination revealed the
attachment of gram-negative bacilli to epithelial apical membranes and
desquamated epithelial cells in the cecum of animals in the high-concentration
group at 3 DPI. These findings suggest that EPEC is a causative agent of
hemorrhagic typhlocolitis in common marmosets.

Complex motor skills of eventual benefit can be learned after considerable trial 
and error. What do structural brain changes that accompany such effortful
long-term learning tell us about the mechanisms for developing innovative
behavior? Using MRI, we monitored brain structure before, during and after four
marmosets learnt to use a rake, over a long period of 10-13 months. Throughout
learning, improvements in dexterity and visuo-motor co-ordination correlated with
increased volume in the lateral extrastriate cortex. During late learning, when
the most complex behavior was maintained by sustained motivation to acquire the
skill, the volume of the nucleus accumbens increased. These findings reflect the 
motivational state required to learn, and show accelerated function in higher
visual cortex that is consistent with neurocognitive divergence across a spectrum
of primate species.

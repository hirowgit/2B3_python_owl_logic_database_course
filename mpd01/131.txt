Inclusion bodies (IBs) and multinucleate cells can be associated with viral
infections; however, IBs and multinucleate cells have been described in normal
tissue and with non-viral disease processes in multiple species. We examined
fundic stomach from 50 callitrichids histologically for bi- and multinucleate
parietal cells and cytoplasmic IBs in gastric epithelial cells. Callitrichids
represented included 6 genera: Saguinus (4 spp.), Leontopithecus (1 sp.), Mico (3
spp.), Cebuella (1 sp.), Callithrix (1 sp.), Callimico (1 sp.), and 13
unspecified marmosets. Gastric epithelial IBs were present in 46 of 47 (98%) of
the callitrichids from which the stomach was sufficiently well preserved to
identify IBs. Cytoplasmic IBs were identified in gastric surface pit epithelial
cells (43 of 44, 98%), mucous neck cells (43 of 44, 98%), parietal cells (43 of
44, 98%), and chief cells (43 of 44, 98%). The IBs were eosinophilic, ovoid,
round, elongate, or variably indented, sometimes slightly refractile, and 1-6 ×
1-13 µm. IBs were sometimes perinuclear and molded around the nucleus. Electron
microscopy of the gastric epithelium of one marmoset indicated that IBs were
composed of intermediate filaments. The IBs did not stain with
immunohistochemical markers for cytokeratin AE1/AE3 or vimentin. Binucleate
parietal cells were found in 49 of 50 (98%) callitrichids, and multinucleate
parietal cells were observed in 40 of 49 (82%) callitrichids. Gastric epithelial 
cytoplasmic IBs and bi- and multinucleate parietal cells are likely a normal
finding in callitrichids, and, to our knowledge, have not been reported
previously.

The propagation of assembled α-synuclein (αS) is key to understanding the
pathological mechanisms of synucleinopathies such as Parkinson's disease,
dementia with Lewy bodies, and multiple system atrophy.Here we describe a
nonhuman primate model of αS propagation using common marmosets (Callithrix
jacchus) with an intracerebral injection of synthetic preformed αS fibrils. This 
protocol enables observation of the formation of phosphorylated αS pathology and 
its propagation three months after the injection.

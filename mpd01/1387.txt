The suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) are pointed to as the mammals central circadian 
pacemaker. Aged animals show internal time disruption possibly caused by
morphological and neurochemical changes in SCN components. Some studies reported 
changes of neuronal cells and neuroglia in the SCN of rats and nonhuman primates 
during aging. The effects of senescence on morphological aspects in SCN are
important for understanding some alterations in biological rhythms expression.
Therefore, our aim was to perform a comparative study of the morphological
aspects of SCN in adult and aged female marmoset. Morphometric analysis of SCN
was performed using Nissl staining, NeuN-IR, GFAP-IR, and CB-IR. A significant
decrease in the SCN cells staining with Nissl, NeuN, and CB were observed in aged
female marmosets compared to adults, while a significant increase in glial cells 
was found in aged marmosets, thus suggesting compensatory process due to neuronal
loss evoked by aging.

BACKGROUND: Common marmosets are known to develop an IgM glomerulopathy, which
has been linked with 'wasting marmoset' syndrome. This study investigated renal
pathology in a colony of marmosets, with and without weight loss.
METHODS: Renal histology, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy were
performed on marmosets euthanized for research or for weight loss. Serum and
urine biochemistry were measured during life and at euthanasia.
RESULTS: Histology from 25 adult marmosets (19 research and 6 weight loss) showed
mesangial expansion in the majority of glomeruli. Mesangial changes correlated
with electron-dense deposits and IgM deposition by immunofluorescence; negligible
other pathology was seen. Glomerular basement membrane thickness appeared
increased compared to reported human measurements. Low-grade proteinuria was
present in all animals, but did not progress. Renal function was normal in all
animals.
CONCLUSIONS: Marmosets develop a glomerulopathy characterized by mesangial
expansion, IgM deposition, and proteinuria. This is a benign occurrence and not
specifically associated with weight loss.

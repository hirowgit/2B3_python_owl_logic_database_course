Genome editing technology greatly facilitates the genetic modification of various
cells and animals. The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a small non-human
primate which exhibits high reproductive efficiency, is a widely used animal
model in biomedical research. Developing genome editing techniques in the common 
marmoset will further enhance its utility. Here, we report the successful
establishment of a knock-in (KI) method for marmoset embryonic stem cells (ESCs),
which is based on the CRISPR-Cas9 system. The use of CRISPR-Cas9, mediated by
homologous recombination (HR), enhanced the KI efficiency in marmoset ESCs.
Furthermore, we succeeded in performing KI in early-stage marmoset embryos. In
the course of the experiments, we found that HR in the marmoset ESCs is innately 
highly efficient. This suggested that the marmoset possesses a repair mechanism
for DNA double-strand breaks. The current study will facilitate the generation of
genetically modified marmosets and gene function analysis in the marmoset.

PURPOSE: Ex vivo brains have different MRI properties than in vivo brains because
of chemical changes caused by fixative solutions, which change the signal
intensity and/or tissue contrast on MR images. In this study, we investigated and
compared the MRI properties of in vivo and ex vivo brains.
METHODS: Using a Bruker 9.4T experimental scanner unit for animals (Biospin GmbH,
Ettlingen, Germany), we performed this study on the common marmoset. We measured 
the relaxation and diffusion values in the white matter and cortex of common
marmosets and compared these values between in vivo brains (n = 20) and ex vivo
brains (n = 20). Additionally, we observed the relationship between the tissue
fixation duration and MRI properties by imaging a brain that underwent long-term 
fixation in a preliminary examination (n = 1).
RESULTS: The T1 values of ex vivo brains were decreased compared with those of in
vivo brains; however, there were no significant difference in the T2 and T2*
values of in vivo and ex vivo brains. Axial, radial, and mean diffusivity values 
of ex vivo brains decreased to approximately 65% and 52% of those of in vivo
brains in the cortex and white matter, respectively. Conversely, fractional
anisotropy values were not significantly different between in vivo and ex vivo
brains.
CONCLUSION: The T1 values and diffusion coefficient values of the ex vivo brains 
were strikingly different than those of the in vivo brains. Conversely, there
were no significant changes in the T2, T2* or fractional anisotropy values.
Altogether, the dehydration caused by tissue fixation and the reduction in brain 
temperature were involved in changing the relaxation and diffusion coefficient
values. Here, it was difficult to specify all factors causing these changes.
Further detailed study is needed to examine changes in MRI properties.

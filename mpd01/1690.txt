Genetic variation in the human serotonin system has long been studied because of 
its functional consequences and links to various neuropsychiatric and
behavior-related disorders. Among non-human primates, the common marmosets
(Callithrix jacchus) and tufted capuchins monkeys (Cebus apella) are becoming
increasingly used as models to study the effects of genes, environments, and
their interaction on physiology and complex behavior. In order to investigate the
independent functions of and potential interactions between serotonin-related
genes, anxiety and neuropsychiatric disorders, we analyzed the presence and
variability of the serotonin transporter gene-linked polymorphic region
(5-HTTLPR) in marmoset and capuchin monkeys. By PCR and using heterologous
primers from the human sequence, we amplified and then sequenced the
corresponding 5-HTT region in marmosets and capuchins. The resulting data
revealed the presence of a tandem repeat sequence similar to that described in
humans, but unlike humans and other Old World primates, no variable length
alleles were detected in these New World monkeys, suggesting that if serotonin
transporter is involved in modulating behavior in these animals it does so
through different molecular mechanisms.

CONCLUSION: We conclude that facial nerve injury induced by compression is
associated with a reasonable time window (4 weeks) that allows possible
neurotrophic effects to be analyzed. Additionally, there are no hints of
cross-innervation by the contralateral facial nerve or parallel innervation by
other nerves in the hemiface ipsilateral to the injured nerve.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this work was to develop an experimental model of facial
nerve injury in nonhuman primates (Callithrix sp.).
METHODS: In this study, individuals of the non-human primate species Callithrix
sp. were subjected to three different types of facial nerve injury, and they were
observed for 27 days after surgery by video to record their facial movements.
RESULTS: Two types of nerve compression caused severe initial facial paralysis
followed by gradual recovery until normal levels were reached at the end of the
evaluation period. Injury induced by nerve resection was followed by a complete
lack of facial movement recovery.

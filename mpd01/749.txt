The common marmoset has been proposed as a potential alternative to macaque
monkey as a primate model for neuroscience and medical research. Here, we have
newly developed a stereotaxic neuronal recording system for awake marmosets under
the head-fixed condition by modifying that for macaque monkeys. Using this
system, we recorded neuronal activity in the cerebral cortex of awake marmosets
and successfully identified the primary motor cortex by intracortical
microstimulation. Neuronal activities of deep brain structures, such as the basal
ganglia, thalamus, and cerebellum, in awake marmosets were also successfully
recorded referring to magnetic resonance images. Our system is suitable for
functional mapping of the brain, since the large recording chamber allows access 
to arbitrary regions over almost the entire brain, and the recording electrode
can be easily moved stereotaxically from one site to another. In addition, our
system is desirable for neuronal recording during task performance to assess
motor skills and cognitive function, as the marmoset sits in the marmoset chair
and can freely use its hands. Moreover, our system can be used in combination
with cutting-edge techniques, such as two-photon imaging and optogenetic
manipulation. This recording system will contribute to boosting neuroscience and 
medical research using marmosets.

The dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus receives projections from visuotopically
organized subcortical nuclei, in addition to inputs from the retina, visual
cortices, and the thalamic reticular nucleus. Here, we study subcortical
projections to the geniculate from the superior colliculus (SC) and parabigeminal
nucleus (PBG) in the midbrain, and the nucleus of the optic tract (NOT) in the
pretectum of marmosets. Marmosets are New World diurnal foveate monkeys, and are 
an increasingly popular model for studying the primate visual system.
Furthermore, the koniocellular geniculate layers in marmosets, unlike those in
the geniculate of commonly studied diurnal Old World monkeys, are well
differentiated from the parvocellular and magnocellular layers. Thus, in the
present study, we have made small iontophoretic injections of the retrograde
tracer microruby, targeted to the koniocellular layers in the geniculates of four
marmosets. We found direct projections from the ipsilateral SC, PBG, and NOT to
the koniocellular geniculate layers. The distribution of retrogradely labeled
cells in the superficial, visual layers of SC is consistent with the idea that
projections from the SC to the koniocellular layers are visuotopically organized.
A little over 20 years ago, Vivien Casagrande () introduced the idea that
koniocellular geniculate layers (rather than the parvocellular and magnocellular 
layers) are principal targets of visuotopically organized subcortical nuclei. Our
results add to subsequent evidence assembled by Casagrande and others in favor of
this hypothesis.

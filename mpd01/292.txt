Interest in the well being of wild animals in their natural habitats is still
lower than that of domesticated animals and captive wild animals. Urban
development is one of the events that has the greatest impact on fauna, as it
affects the survival and well being of wild species in many ways. This study
aimed to record death by being run over of two Callithrix penicillata
(black-tufted) marmosets in a fragmented environment by urbanization and to
discuss how anthropic intervention modifies species behavior and influences their
well being, and to suggest measures which can reduce the occurrence of incidents,
thereby contributing to maintaining the fauna and their well being.

Whereas monoamine oxidase (MAO) type B inhibitors are used as adjunct to
L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) in the treatment of Parkinson's disease
(PD), the enzyme MAO type A (MAO-A) also participates in the metabolism of
dopamine in the human and primate striatum. Here, we sought to assess the effect 
of the selective reversible MAO-A inhibitor moclobemide on L-DOPA
anti-parkinsonian in the gold standard animal model of PD, the
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-lesioned primate. We also
assessed the effect of moclobemide on L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia and
psychosis-like behaviours (PLBs). Experiments were performed in six MPTP-lesioned
marmosets chronically treated with L-DOPA and exhibiting stable dyskinesia and
PLBs upon each administration. In a randomised within-subject design, animals
were administered a therapeutic dose of L-DOPA in combination with moclobemide
(0.1, 1 and 10 mg/kg) or its vehicle, after which the severity of parkinsonism,
dyskinesia, and PLBs was rated by an experienced blinded rater. Moclobemide
significantly reduced the global parkinsonian disability (- 36% with 0.1 mg/kg,
P < 0.05; - 38% with 1 mg/kg, P < 0.01; - 47% with 10 mg/kg, P < 0.01), when
compared with its vehicle. This reduction of parkinsonism was not accompanied by 
an exacerbation of dyskinesia or PLBs. Reversible MAO-A inhibition with
moclobemide appears as an effective way to increase the anti-parkinsonian action 
of L-DOPA, without negatively affecting dyskinesia or dopaminergic psychosis.

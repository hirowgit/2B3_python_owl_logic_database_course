1. A potentially useful animal model for preclinical studies is the common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). In this study, using reverse-transcription
polymerase chain reaction from marmoset livers, we identified a novel cytochrome 
P450 (P450) 2F1 cDNA with an open reading frame of 1473 bp. 2. High sequence
identities of 92-94% with primate P450 2 F amino acid sequences were indicated by
deduced amino acid sequences of P450 2F1 cDNA. Phylogenetic analysis indicates
that marmoset P450 2F1 is more congruent with primate P450 2 F forms than those
of other species such as rodents. 3. Among five tissue types examined, abundant
expression of marmoset P450 2F1 mRNA and P450 2F1 protein in lungs was shown.
Cynomolgus monkey P450 2F1 mRNA was abundantly expressed in lungs as well as
testes and ovaries in 10 tissue types. 4. Similar to those of humans and
cynomolgus monkeys, marmoset P450 2F1 heterologously expressed in Escherichia
coli membranes efficiently catalyzed 7-ethoxycoumarin O-deethylation and biphenyl
hydroxylation, however unlike human P450 2F1, marmoset P450 2F1 exhibited
hydroxylation activity toward coumarin and chlorzoxazone. 5. These findings
indicated that P450 2F1 enzyme expressed in marmoset lungs and also catalyzed
metabolism of xenobiotics, suggesting the importance of P450 2 F-dependent drug
metabolism in marmoset lungs.

Whole-brain imaging is becoming a fundamental means of experimental insight;
however, achieving subcellular resolution imagery in a reasonable time window has
not been possible. We describe the first application of multicolor ribbon
scanning confocal methods to collect high-resolution volume images of chemically 
cleared brains. We demonstrate that ribbon scanning collects images over ten
times faster than conventional high speed confocal systems but with equivalent
spectral and spatial resolution. Further, using this technology, we reconstruct
large volumes of mouse brain infected with encephalitic alphaviruses and
demonstrate that regions of the brain with abundant viral replication were
inaccessible to vascular perfusion. This reveals that the destruction or collapse
of large regions of brain micro vasculature may contribute to the severe disease 
caused by Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus. Visualization of this fundamental
impact of infection would not be possible without sampling at subcellular
resolution within large brain volumes.

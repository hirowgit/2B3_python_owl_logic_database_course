Some indices have been studied which characterized the state of Epstein-Barr
virus genome and adenovirus in the implanted lines of lymphoblastoid cells of B
and T phenotype under the mixed or monoinfection. It has been shown that super
infection by type 2 adenovirus rather sharply affects the state of Epstein-Barr
virus genome in the Raji cells containing integrated Epstein-Barr virus genome.
The state of adenovirus genome in the studied cells is less subject to changes.
Its early area is revealed by hybridization using DNA-DNA method in a form of two
fragments of different intensity which is maximum in the Raji and Jurkat cells,
which evidences for the more expressivity of adenovirus genome in these cells.

Area 17 of anthropoid primates does participate in visual callosal connections.

Spatz WB, Kunz B.

Injections of retrograde tracers into the border region of areas 17 and 18 in
Callithrix and Macaca labeled a small group of neurons in the border region of
contralateral area 17, in addition to cells in contralateral area 18. It is
concluded that area 17 of anthropoid primates sends (and receives) fibers through
the corpus callosum.

Undifferentiated carcinoma of the nasal tissues in the common marmoset.

Baskerville M, Baskerville A, Manktelow BW.

The occurrence of undifferentiated carcinoma of the nasal tissues in 3 adult
marmosets is described. The tumours appeared to arise from the respiratory
epithelium of the turbinate bones and nasal septum. They were poorly
differentiated, invaded the paranasal sinuses and hard palate and metastasized to
the lungs or liver.

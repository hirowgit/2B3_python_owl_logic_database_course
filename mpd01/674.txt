Porous silicon nanoparticles (pSiNP), modified to target dendritic cells (DC),
provide an alternate strategy for the delivery of immunosuppressive drugs. Here, 
we aimed to develop a DC-targeting pSiNP displaying c-type lectin, dendritic
cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN), 
and CD11c monoclonal antibodies. The in vivo tracking of these fluorescent
DC-targeting nanoparticles was assessed in both C57BL/6 mice and common marmosets
( Callithrix jacchus) by intravenous injection (20 mg/kg). Rapamycin and
ovalbumin (OVA)323-339 peptide loaded pSiNP were employed to evaluate their
ability to generate murine CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ regulatory T-cells in vivo within OVA 
sensitized mice. In vivo, pSiNP migrated to the liver, kidneys, lungs, and spleen
in both mice and marmosets. Flow cytometry confirmed pSiNP uptake by splenic and 
peripheral blood DC when functionalized with targeting antibodies. C57BL/6 OVA
sensitized mice injected with CD11c-pSiNP loaded with rapamycin + OVA323-339
produced a 5-fold higher number of splenic regulatory T-cells compared to control
mice, at 40 days post-pSiNP injection. These results demonstrate the importance
of the immobilized targeting antibodies to enhance cellular uptake and enable the
in vivo generation of splenic regulatory T-cells.

Blockade of serotonin 2A (5-HT2A) receptors is regarded as an anti-dyskinetic and
anti-psychotic strategy in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the 5-HT2A
antagonists tested so far exhibited affinity for other receptors, which might
have played a role in their action. EMD-281,014 is the most selective 5-HT2A
antagonist available, with approximately 2,000-fold selectivity over serotonin 2C
(5-HT2C) receptors. EMD-281,014 was previously tested in the clinic and has high 
translational potential. In the present study, we assessed the effect of
EMD-281,014 on dyskinesia and psychosis in the
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-lesioned common marmoset. We 
first determined the pharmacokinetic profile of EMD-281,014 in the marmoset,
after which doses leading to clinically-relevant plasma levels (0.01, 0.03 and
0.1 mg/kg) or vehicle were administered to MPTP-lesioned marmosets, in
combination with L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA). The effects of
EMD-281,014 on dyskinesia, psychosis-like behaviours (PLBs) and parkinsonism were
then evaluated. When added to l-DOPA, EMD-281,014 (0.03 and 0.1 mg/kg) reduced
peak dose dyskinesia, by 41.8% and 54.5% (P < 0.05 and P < 0.001), when compared 
to l-DOPA/vehicle. EMD-281,014 (0.03 and 0.1 mg/kg) also significantly reduced
the severity of peak dose PLBs, by 42.5% and 45.9% (P < 0.05 and P < 0.001), when
compared to vehicle. The anti-dyskinetic and anti-psychotic effects of
EMD-281,014 were achieved without interfering with l-DOPA anti-parkinsonian
action. Our results suggest that highly-selective 5-HT2A receptor blockade with
EMD-281,014 is an effective way to alleviate both dyskinesia and psychosis in PD,
without adversely affecting parkinsonian disability.

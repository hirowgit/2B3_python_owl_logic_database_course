Astrocytes are among the most numerous cells in the brain and fulfill diverse
functions in homeostasis and regulation of neuronal activity. Astrocytes also
dramatically change their properties in response to brain injury or disease, a
process called reactive gliosis. Precisely how astrocytes contribute to healthy
brain function and play differential roles in brain pathology and regeneration
remain important areas of investigation. To better understand the properties of
astrocytes, more sophisticated approaches for probing their rich and complex
anatomical and molecular features are needed to fully determine their
contribution to brain physiology. Here we present an efficient and
straightforward immunolabeling protocol to obtain high-resolution
fluorescence-based images from fixed nonhuman primate (common marmoset Callithrix
jacchus) and human brain samples. Importantly, the protocol is useful for
obtaining images from samples that have been stored in fixative solutions (such
as formalin) for years. This approach is especially useful for three-dimensional,
multichannel confocal microscopy and can be optimized for super-resolution
techniques such as stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy. We also
present a strategy for using specific combinations of markers to define the
phenotypic variations and cellular/subcellular properties of astrocytes to better
predict the function of these cells on their surrounding brain microenvironment.

Marmoset monkeys are an useful model to biological human experiments and their
development in captivity has been carried out in different environment and
feeding conditions. This work presents the development of Callithrix jacchus
jacchus and Callithrix jacchus penicillata in captivity at the vivarium of the
Centro de Biologia da Reprodução. Couples of marmosets, obtained with the help of
the Forest Institute, were kept in an environment where the temperature was
around 22-24 degrees C, with 10 hs of light per day and fed on a diet of dog chow
pellets, bananas, eggs, carrots, Farinha Láctea (Nestlé) and milk. Comparing the 
number of newborns/delivery, interbirth delivery, and some other indicators, it
was concluded that the development of Callithrix jacchus jacchus is compatible
with other colonies cited in the literature. The development of Callithrix
jacchus penicillata, on which no report has been found, is similar to that of
Callithrix jacchus jacchus.

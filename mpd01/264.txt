BACKGROUND: Ceramides are lipid molecules determining cell integrity and
intercellular signaling, and thus, involved in the pathogenesis of several
psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. However, little is known about the
role of particular enzymes of the ceramide metabolism in the mechanisms of normal
behavioral plasticity. Here, we studied the contribution of neutral ceramidase
(NC), one of the main enzymes mediating ceramide degradation, in the mechanisms
of learning and memory in rats and non-human primates.
METHODS: Naïve Wistar rats and black tufted-ear marmosets (Callithrix
penicillata) were tested in several tests for short- and long-term memory and
then divided into groups with various memory performance. The activities of NC
and acid ceramidase (AC) were measured in these animals. Additionally, anxiety
and depression-like behavior and brain levels of monoamines were assessed in the 
rats.
RESULTS: We observed a predictive role of NC activity in the blood serum for
superior performance of long-term object memory tasks in both species. A brain
area analysis suggested that high NC activity in the ventral mesencephalon (VM)
predicts better short-term memory performance in rats. High NC activity in the VM
was also associated with worse long-term object memory, which might be mediated
by an enhanced depression-like state and a monoaminergic imbalance.
CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, these data suggest a role for NC in short- and long-term
memory of various mammalian species. Serum activity of NC may possess a
predictive role in the assessing the performance of certain types of memory.

Neurons communicate with other neurons in response to environmental changes.
Their goal is to transmit information to their targets reliably. A burst, which
consists of multiple spikes within a short time interval, plays an essential role
in enhancing the reliability of information transmission through synapses. In the
visual system, retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), the output neurons of the retina,
show bursting activity and transmit retinal information to the lateral geniculate
neuron of the thalamus. In this study, to extend our interest to the population
level, the burstings of multiple RGCs were simultaneously recorded using a
multi-channel recording system. As the first step in network analysis, we focused
on investigating the pairwise burst correlation between two RGCs. Furthermore, to
assess if the population bursting is preserved across species, we compared the
synchronized bursting of RGCs between marmoset monkey (callithrix jacchus), one
species of the new world monkeys and mouse (C57BL/6J strain). First, monkey RGCs 
showed a larger number of spikes within a burst, while the inter-spike interval, 
burst duration, and inter-burst interval were smaller compared with mouse RGCs.
Monkey RGCs showed a strong burst synchronization between RGCs, whereas mouse
RGCs showed no correlated burst firing. Monkey RGC pairs showed significantly
higher burst synchrony and mutual information than mouse RGC pairs did.
Comprehensively, through this study, we emphasize that two species have a
different bursting activity of RGCs and different burst synchronization
suggesting two species have distinctive retinal processing.

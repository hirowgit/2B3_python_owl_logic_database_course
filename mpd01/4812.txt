Experimental infection of the marmoset genital tract with Chlamydia trachomatis.

Johnson AP, Hetherington CM, Osborn MF, Thomas BJ, Taylor-Robinson D.

A strain of Chlamydia trachomatis isolated in McCoy cells from the urethra of a
patient suffering from non-gonococcal urethritis was inoculated into the vagina
of 8 female marmosets. Chlamydiae were isolated repeatedly for 10-42 days from
the lower genital tract of 7 of the marmosets. Six of the infected animals
developed an acute inflammatory reaction in the genital tract and chlamydial
inclusions in epithelial cells were seen in smears from 2 of them. In addition,
each of 6 infected marmosets examined developed humoral antibodies to C.
trachomatis. In contrast, 3 control animals inoculated intravaginally with
chlamydia-free McCoy cells showed no evidence of chlamydial infection. Since the 
marmoset is small and easily bred in captivity, it should provide a useful model 
for studying the mechanisms of chlamydial pathogenicity.

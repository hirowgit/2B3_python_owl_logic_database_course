The behavior, cortisol concentration and cerebral hemisphere activity of twelve
marmoset monkeys were determined during standardized predatory stress-related
events. Each subject was submitted to three 5-min trials, randomly held at 2-week
intervals: a human intruder, a taxidermized oncilla cat and a no-stimulus control
trial. Stimuli were positioned outside the home-cage and the ensuing reaction
recorded. Baseline tympanic membrane temperature (TMT) was subtracted from the
post-trial measure to determine changes in blood flow induced by ipsilateral
brain activity. Cortisol was assayed immediately after the post-trial TMT
assessments. Both genders reacted fearfully/anxiously towards the stimuli - each 
condition inducing a distinct pattern. Cortisol increased only when females were 
confronted with the wildcat, with higher levels of alarm calls predicting lower
cortisol release. When either stimulus was present, changes in TMT were detected,
albeit only in the right ear. The specific directional shift in temperature was
gender- and stimulus-dependent, requiring further investigation. The control
trial did not alter any of the parameters. Marmosets thus exhibit flexible
multileveled coping strategies towards different aversive events, yet in general 
these seem to be asymmetrically processed by the right cerebral hemisphere.

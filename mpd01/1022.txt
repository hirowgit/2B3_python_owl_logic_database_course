Deafness is one of the most common types of congenital impairments, and at least 
half of the cases are caused by hereditary mutations. Mutations of the gene
KIAA1199 are associated with progressive hearing loss. Its expression is abundant
in human cochlea, but interestingly the spatial expression patterns are different
between mouse and rat cochleae; the pattern in humans has not been fully
investigated. We performed immunohistochemical analysis of a nonhuman primate,
common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), cochlea with a KIAA1199-specific antibody. 
In the common marmoset cochlea, KIAA1199 protein expression was more widespread
than in rodents, with all epithelial cells, including hair cells, expressing
KIAA1199. Our results suggest that the primate pattern of KIAA1199 expression is 
wider in comparison with rodents and may play an essential role in the
maintenance of cochlear epithelial cells.

BACKGROUND: Marmosets are a powerful, emerging model for human behavior and
neurological disorders. However, longitudinal imaging modalities that visualize
both cellular structure and function within the cortex are not available in this 
animal model. Hence, we implemented an approach to quantify vascular topology,
hemodynamics, and neural activity in awake marmosets using two-photon microscopy 
(2PM).
NEW METHOD: Marmosets were acclimated to a custom stereotaxic system.
AAV1-GCaMP5G was injected into somatosensory cortex to optically indicate neural 
activity, and a cranial chamber was implanted.
RESULTS: Longitudinal 2PM revealed vasculature and neurons 500Î¼m below the
cortical surface. Vascular response and neural activity during sensory
stimulation were preserved over 5 and 3 months, respectively, before optical
quality deteriorated. Vascular remodeling including increased tortuosity and
branching was quantified. However, capillary connectivity from arterioles to
venules remained unchanged. Further, behavioral assessment before and after
surgery demonstrated no impact on cognitive and motor function.
Immunohistochemistry confirmed minimal astrocyte activation with no focal damage.
Over 6 months, total cortical depth visualized decreased. When under anesthesia, 
the most prominent isoflurane-induced vasodilation occurred in capillaries and
smaller arterioles.
COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHOD(S): These results demonstrate the capability to
repeatedly observe cortical physiology in awake marmosets over months.
CONCLUSIONS: This work provides a novel and insightful technique to investigate
critical mechanisms in neurological disorders in awake marmosets without
introducing confounds from anesthesia.

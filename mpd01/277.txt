Under certain circumstances, cortical neurons are capable of elevating their
firing for long durations in the absence of a stimulus. Such activity has
typically been observed and interpreted in the context of performance of a
behavioural task. Here we investigated whether post-stimulatory activity is
observed in auditory cortex and the medial geniculate body of the thalamus in the
absence of any explicit behavioural task. We recorded spiking activity from
single units in the auditory cortex (fields A1, R and RT) and auditory thalamus
of awake, passively-listening marmosets. We observed post-stimulatory activity
that lasted for hundreds of milliseconds following the termination of the
acoustic stimulus. Post-stimulatory activity was observed following both
adapting, sustained and suppressed response profiles during the stimulus. These
response types were observed across all cortical fields tested, but were largely 
absent from the auditory thalamus. As well as being of shorter duration, thalamic
post-stimulatory activity emerged following a longer latency than in cortex,
indicating that post-stimulatory activity may be generated within auditory cortex
during passive listening. Given that these responses were observed in the absence
of an explicit behavioural task, post-stimulatory activity in sensory cortex may 
play a functional role in processes such as echoic memory and temporal
integration that occur during passive listening.

Cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis, an Old World Monkey) have been widely
used as a non-human primate model in preclinical studies because of their genetic
and physiological similarity to humans. This trend has been followed by common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus, a New World Monkey). However, drug-metabolism
properties in these non-human primates have not been fully understood due to
limited information on cytochrome P450 (P450) enzymes, major drug-metabolizing
enzymes in humans. Multiple forms of cynomolgus monkey P450 enzymes have been
identified and characterized in comparison to those of humans, including a
cynomolgus monkey specific form, P450 2C76. Similarly, marmoset P450 1A/B, 2A,
2C, 2D, and 4F enzymes were recently identified and characterized to understand
drug metabolism properties. In this research update, updates for marmoset,
cynomolgus monkey, and human P450 cDNAs are provided. Marmoset and cynomolgus
monkey P450 enzymes showed high sequence homology to their human counterparts and
generally had similar substrate recognition functionality to human P450 enzymes; 
however, they also possibly contribute to limited specific differences in drug
oxidative metabolism partly due to small differences in amino acid residues.
These findings provide a foundation for successful use of non-human primates as
preclinical models and will help to further understand molecular mechanisms of
human P450 function. In addition to the P450 enzymes, flavin-containing
monooxygenases, another monooxygenase family, in these non-human primates have
been found to be involved in the oxidation of a variety of compounds associated
with pharmacological and/or toxicological effects in humans and are also
described.

MOTIVATION: Deep sequencing of the transcripts of regulatory non-coding RNA
generates footprints of post-transcriptional processes. After obtaining sequence 
reads, the short reads are mapped to a reference genome, and specific mapping
patterns can be detected called read mapping profiles, which are distinct from
random non-functional degradation patterns. These patterns reflect the maturation
processes that lead to the production of shorter RNA sequences. Recent
next-generation sequencing studies have revealed not only the typical maturation 
process of miRNAs but also the various processing mechanisms of small RNAs
derived from tRNAs and snoRNAs.
RESULTS: We developed an algorithm termed SHARAKU to align two read mapping
profiles of next-generation sequencing outputs for non-coding RNAs. In contrast
with previous work, SHARAKU incorporates the primary and secondary sequence
structures into an alignment of read mapping profiles to allow for the detection 
of common processing patterns. Using a benchmark simulated dataset, SHARAKU
exhibited superior performance to previous methods for correctly clustering the
read mapping profiles with respect to 5'-end processing and 3'-end processing
from degradation patterns and in detecting similar processing patterns in
deriving the shorter RNAs. Further, using experimental data of small RNA
sequencing for the common marmoset brain, SHARAKU succeeded in identifying the
significant clusters of read mapping profiles for similar processing patterns of 
small derived RNA families expressed in the brain.
AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The source code of our program SHARAKU is
available at http://www.dna.bio.keio.ac.jp/sharaku/, and the simulated dataset
used in this work is available at the same link. Accession code: The sequence
data from the whole RNA transcripts in the hippocampus of the left brain used in 
this work is available from the DNA DataBank of Japan (DDBJ) Sequence Read
Archive (DRA) under the accession number DRA004502.

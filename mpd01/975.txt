Racemic omeprazole has been used for clinically treating gastric acid-related
diseases and also as a typical human cytochrome P450 (P450) 2C19 probe substrate 
in preclinical studies. S-Omeprazole has been developed as a single enantiomer
medicine, which has been reported not to be associated with polymorphic human
P450 2C19 phenotypes. In this study, 5-hydroxylation and sulfoxidation
activities, with respect to stereoselective R- and S-omeprazole oxidations by
liver microsomes from experimental animals including non-human primates and
humans, were investigated in vitro. Liver microsomes from humans, cynomolgus
monkeys, and mice preferentially mediated R-omeprazole 5-hydroxylations, however 
those from marmosets, minipigs, dogs, and rats preferentially mediated
S-omeprazole 5-hydroxylations. High catalytic activities were observed for
recombinant human P450 2C19 in R-omeprazole 5-hydroxlations, cynomolgus monkey
P450 2C19 in both R- and S-omeprazole 5-hydroxlations, and marmoset P450 2C19 in 
S-omeprazole 5-hydroxlations. On the other hand, human, cynomolgus monkey, and
marmoset P450 3A enzymes preferentially mediated S-omeprazole sulfoxidations.
Correlation and kinetic analyses revealed a high affinity of polymorphic
cynomolgus monkey and marmoset liver microsomal P450 2C19 enzymes with respect to
R- and S-omeprazole 5-hydroxylations, respectively, and a high capacity of
cynomolgus monkey and marmoset liver microsomal P450 3A4 for omeprazole
5-hydroxylations and sulfoxidations. R-and S-omeprazole 5-hydroxylation
activities in cynomolgus monkey and marmoset liver microsomes were significantly 
different among wild-type, heterozygous, and homozygous animals genotyped for
cynomolgus monkey P450 2C19 p.[(Phe100Asn; Ala103Val; Ile112Leu)] and for
marmoset P450 2C19 p.[(Phe7Leu; Ser254Leu; Ile469Thr)], respectively. The results
of this study demonstrate polymorphic cynomolgus monkey and marmoset P450
2C19-dependent omeprazole oxidation activities with individual variations similar
to humans.

The advantages of living in a group include feeding benefits and/or predation
avoidance, while the disadvantages are typically related to competition. One way 
to avoid competition while maintaining the benefits of living in a group is to
form interspecific associations with species with relatively little dietary
overlap. Here we report a stable association between a male golden-headed lion
tamarin (GHLT), Leontopithecus chrysomelas, and a group of Wied's
black-tufted-ear marmosets (WBTMs), Callithrix kuhlii. We collected ecological
and behavioral data on a duo of GHLTs from May to August 2008, totaling 62 h of
observations. On 19 August 2008, the radio-collared GHLT dispersed alone and was 
located on 28 August in association with WBTMs. To examine possible changes in
GHLT ecology and behavior, we monitored the mixed-species group between September
and December 2008, totaling 122 h of observations. We found that the GHLT's home 
range and daily path length decreased by about ten and three times, respectively,
after joining the WBTM group, suggesting adaptations to the WBTMs' use of space. 
All non-agonistic behaviors recorded in the mixed group were directed from GHLT
to the WBMTs, whereas all agonistic interactions were directed from the WBMTs to 
the GHLT, indicating a subordinate position of GHLT in the mixed group. In golden
lion tamarins, reproductive success of subordinate adult males that remain in the
group is higher than that of those that disperse and "prospect" for a breeding
opportunity. If dispersing individuals are unable to find a mate and defend a
territory, they will likely die within a year. The dispersing GHLT in this study 
assumed a subordinate role in a mixed-species group outside a GHLT territory.
Apparently, the benefits of waiting for a dispersing female in a relatively safe 
situation may exceed the costs of prospecting elsewhere or being a subordinate.

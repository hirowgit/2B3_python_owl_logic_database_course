A nonsurgical technique for the recovery of uterine stage preimplantation embryos
was developed for the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). In 54 flush attempts,
using 19 different animals, 54 morphologically normal embryos, seven unfertilized
oocytes or degenerate embryos, and five empty zonae pellucidae were recovered,
giving a recovery rate of 1.0 embryo per flush or 1.2 ovulation products per
flush. Because the ovarian cycles of common marmosets can be synchronized with
prostaglandin PGF2 alpha, multiple marmosets can be flushed in a short period,
providing age-matched embryos for controlled experiments.

The "normal" mesangium of callitrichids exhibits certain features pointing to
enhanced activity. Protrusions of the mesangial cellular cytoplasm (blebs) into
the capillary lumen were observed very frequently as were electron-dense granules
in mesangial matrix channels. Histochemical, alpha-actin expression was
invariably observed in the mesangial cells of callitrichids.

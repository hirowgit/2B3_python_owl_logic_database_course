Serotonin (5-HT) is involved in the fine adjustments at several brain centers
including the core of the mammal circadian timing system (CTS) and the
hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). The SCN receives massive serotonergic
projections from the midbrain raphe nuclei, whose inputs are described in rats as
ramifying at its ventral portion overlapping the retinohypothalamic and
geniculohypothalamic fibers. In the SCN, the 5-HT actions are reported as being
primarily mediated by the 5-HT1 type receptor with noted emphasis for 5-HT(1B)
subtype, supposedly modulating the retinal input in a presynaptic way. In this
study in a New World primate species, the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus),
we showed the 5-HT(1B) receptor distribution at the dorsal SCN concurrent with a 
distinctive location of 5-HT-immunoreactive fibers. This finding addresses to a
new discussion on the regulation and synchronization of the circadian rhythms in 
recent primates.

Advanced magnetic resonance (MR) neuroimaging analysis techniques based on
voxel-wise statistics, such as voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and functional MRI, 
are widely applied to cognitive brain research in both human subjects and in
non-human primates. Recent developments in imaging have enabled the evaluation of
smaller animal models with sufficient spatial resolution. The common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus), a small New World primate species, has been widely used in 
neuroscience research, to which voxel-wise statistics could be extended with a
species-specific brain template. Here, we report, for the first time, a
tissue-segmented, population-averaged standard template of the common marmoset
brain. This template was created by using anatomical T(1)-weighted images from 22
adult marmosets with a high-resolution isotropic voxel size of (0.2 mm)(3) at
7-Tesla and DARTEL algorithm in SPM8. Whole brain templates are available at
International Neuroinformatics Japan Node website,

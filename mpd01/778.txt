Pheromones are crucial for eliciting innate responses and inducing social and
sexual behaviors in mammals. The vomeronasal receptor 1 genes, V1Rs, encode
members of a pheromone receptor family that are mainly expressed in the
vomeronasal organ (VNO). The V1R family shows extraordinary variety in gene
number among vertebrates owing to successive gene gains and losses during
evolution. Such diversity is believed to reflect a degree of dependence on the
VNO. We investigated V1R evolution in primate lineages closely related to humans 
because these VNOs show a trend toward degeneration. We performed extensive
phylogenetic analyses for V1Rs from a broad range of primate species. Although
the decline of intact genes was evident in anthropoids (hominoids, Old World
monkeys and New World monkeys), we found that a certain number of intact genes
persist in New World monkeys. In one New World monkey species, the common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), we examined seven putatively functional V1Rs using
in situ hybridization and reverse transcription-PCR. Based on their mRNA
expression patterns in the VNO and other organs, two types of V1Rs emerged: the
canonical class with VNO-specific expression, and a second group having more
ubiquitous expression in various organs as well as VNO. Furthermore, phylogenetic
analysis revealed that the class with the more widespread expression had been
retained longer in evolution than the VNO-specific type. We propose that the
acquisition of a novel non-VNO-related function(s) may have led to the survival
of a small but persistent number of V1Rs in anthropoid primates.

Burkholderia mallei causes the highly contagious and debilitating zoonosis
glanders, which infects via inhalation or percutaneous inoculation and often
culminates in life-threatening pneumonia and sepsis. In humans, glanders is
difficult to diagnose and requires prolonged antibiotic therapy with low success 
rates. No vaccine exists to protect against B. mallei, and there is concern
regarding its use as a bioweapon. The authors previously identified the protein
BpaB as a potential target for devising therapies due to its role in adherence to
host cells and the formation of biofilms in vitro and its contribution to
pathogenicity in a mouse model of glanders. In the present study, the authors
developed an immunostaining approach to probe tissues of experimentally infected 
animals and demonstrated that BpaB is produced exclusively in vivo by wild-type
B. mallei in target organs from mice and marmosets. They detected the expression 
of BpaB by B. mallei both extracellularly and within macrophages, neutrophils,
and epithelial cells in respiratory tissues (7/10 marmoset; 2/2 mouse). The
authors also noted the intracellular expression of BpaB by B. mallei in
macrophages in the regional lymph nodes of mice (2/2 tissues) and MALT of
marmosets (4/5 tissues). It is interesting that B. mallei bacteria infecting
distal organs did not express BpaB (2/2 mice; 3/3 marmosets), suggesting that the
protein is not necessary for bacterial fitness in these anatomic locations. These
findings underscore the value of BpaB as a target for developing medical
countermeasures and provide insight into its role in pathogenesis.

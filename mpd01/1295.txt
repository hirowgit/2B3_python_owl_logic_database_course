Trait anxiety is a risk factor for the development and maintenance of affective
disorders, and insights into the underlying brain mechanisms are vital for
improving treatment and prevention strategies. Translational studies in non-human
primates, where targeted neurochemical and genetic manipulations can be made, are
critical in view of their close neuroanatomical similarity to humans in brain
regions implicated in trait anxiety. Thus, we characterised the serotonergic and 
regional brain volume correlates of trait-like anxiety in the marmoset monkey.
Low- and high-anxious animals were identified by behavioral responses to a human 
intruder (HI) that are known to be sensitive to anxiolytic drug treatment.
Extracellular serotonin levels within the amygdala were measured with in vivo
microdialysis, at baseline and in response to challenge with the selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitor, citalopram. Regional brain volume was assessed by
structural magnetic resonance imaging. Anxious individuals showed persistent,
long-term fearful responses to both a HI and a model snake, alongside sustained
attention (vigilance) to novel cues in a context associated with unpredictable
threat. Neurally, high-anxious marmosets showed reduced amygdala serotonin
levels, and smaller volumes in a closely connected prefrontal region, the dorsal 
anterior cingulate cortex. These findings highlight behavioral and neural
similarities between trait-like anxiety in marmosets and humans, and set the
stage for further investigation of the processes contributing to vulnerability
and resilience to affective disorders.

The marmoset spinal cord possesses all the characteristic features of a typical
mammalian spinal cord, but with some interesting variation in the levels of
origin of the limb nerves. In our study Nissl and ChAT sections of the each
segment of the spinal cord in two marmosets (Ma5 and Ma8), we found that the
spinal cord can be functionally and anatomically divided into six regions: the
prebrachial region (C1 to C3); the brachial region (C4 to C8) - segments
supplying the upper limb; the post-brachial region (T1 to L1) - containing the
sympathetic outflow, and supplying the hypaxial muscles of the body wall; the
crural region (L2 to L5) - segments supplying the lower limb; the postcrural
region (L6) - containing the parasympathetic outflow; and the caudal region (L7
to Co4) - supplying the tail. In the rat, mouse, and rhesus monkey, the
prebrachial region consists of segments C1 to C4 (with the phrenic nucleus
located at the C4 segment), and the brachial region extends from C5 to T1
inclusive. The prefixing of the upper limb outflow in these two marmosets mirrors
the finding in the literature that a large C4 contribution to the brachial plexus
is common in humans.

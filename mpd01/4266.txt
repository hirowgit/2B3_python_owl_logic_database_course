Advance in understanding of the anatomy, physiology and pharmacology of basal
ganglia organisation over the past decade revealed a functional relation between 
excitatory glutamatergic and the degenerated dopaminergic nigrostriatal
transmitter systems which could serve as targets for pharmacological
interventions in Parkinson's disease. The selective AMPA-antagonist NBQX is not
effective in animal models of Parkinson's disease when given alone but
ameliorates parkinsonian symptomatology and enhances the locomotor response of a 
threshold dose of L-DOPA. These synergistic effects are seen in the MPTP-treated 
(1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) common marmoset and the rat with
unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesions of the substantia nigra. Here we
report that, in the latter model, such synergism of NBQX is also seen with the
direct dopamine agonists lisuride and apomorphine, indicating the potential
usefulness of AMPA antagonists for the symptomatic treatment of Parkinson's
disease.

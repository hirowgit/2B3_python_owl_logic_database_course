2-hydroxystilbamidine isethionate: a new fluorochrome for use in general
pathology. II. The selective demonstration of fungi.

Murgatroyd LB.

Paraffin sections of kidney, lung and oesophagus containing Aspergillus sp.,
Cryptococcus neoformans and Candida sp. were taken from human post mortem
material and from the marmoset Callithrix jacchus. Sections were stained for 1-5 
min in buffered 2-hydroxystilbamidine isethionate containing sodium
metabisulphite after pre-oxidation in 1 per cent aqueous periodic acid. Sections 
were dehydrated, cleared and mounted in Polymount. When excited with UV light
hyphae and fungal bodies fluoresced white contrasting sharply with yellow nuclear
fluorescence. With blue light nuclei and fungi fluoresced yellow. Staining with
the fluorochrome was pH dependent and behaved as a Schiff type reagent indicative
of its probable behaviour as a basic dye. The method was simple, rapid and
provided permanent fluorescent preparations which over a number of years did not 
fade with routine storage.

Junin virus infection of Calithrix jacchus: haematological findings.

Frigerio MJ, Rondinone SN, Callelo MA, Paradisi ER, Weissenbacher MC.

Haematological changes produced by experimental Junin virus infection of a
platyrrhine monkey, Callithrix jacchus were studied. Normocytic and normochromic 
anaemia appeared after 7 days post infection (p. i.), and increased steadily
until day 21 p. i. Reticulocytes and circulating erythroblasts were elevated
during the anaemia, reached a peak on day 7 p. i., and disappeared later.
Platelets and leukocytes showed a significant decrease from days 14 and 18 p. i.,
respectively. These alterations could be attributed to the damage of bone marrow 
and lymphatic tissue.

Human DNA methylation data have previously been used to develop highly accurate
biomarkers of aging ("epigenetic clocks"). Subsequent studies demonstrate that
similar epigenetic clocks can also be developed for mice and many other mammals. 
Here, we describe epigenetic clocks for common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus)
based on novel DNA methylation data generated from highly conserved mammalian
CpGs that were profiled using a custom Infinium array
(HorvathMammalMethylChip40). From these, we developed and present here two
epigenetic clocks for marmosets that are applicable to whole blood samples. We
find that the human-marmoset clock for relative age exhibits moderately high age 
correlations in two other non-human primate species: vervet monkeys and rhesus
macaques. In a separate cohort of marmosets, we tested whether intervention with 
rapamycin, a drug shown to extend lifespan in mice, would alter the epigenetic
age of marmosets, as measured by the marmoset epigenetic clocks. These clocks did
not detect significant effects of rapamycin on the epigenetic age of marmoset
blood. The common marmoset stands out from other mammals in that it is not
possible to build accurate estimators of sex based on DNA methylation data: the
accuracy of a random forest predictor of sex (66%) was substantially lower than
that observed for other mammals (which is close to 100%). Overall, the epigenetic
clocks developed here for the common marmoset are expected to be useful for age
estimation of wild-born animals and for anti-aging studies in this species.

Dyskinesia and psychosis are complications encountered in advanced Parkinson's
disease (PD) following long-term therapy with L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine
(L-DOPA). Disturbances in the glutamatergic system have been associated with both
dyskinesia and psychosis, making glutamatergic modulation a potential therapeutic
approach for these. Treatments thus far have sought to dampen glutamatergic
transmission, for example through blockade of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)
receptors or modulation of metabotropic glutamate receptors 5. In contrast,
activation of the glycine-binding site on NMDA receptors is required for their
physiological response. Here, we investigated whether indirectly enhancing
glutamatergic transmission through inhibition of glycine re-uptake would be
efficacious in diminishing both dyskinesia and psychosis-like behaviours (PLBs)
in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-lesioned common
marmoset. Six marmosets were rendered parkinsonian by MPTP injection. Following
repeated administration of L-DOPA to induce dyskinesia and PLBs, they underwent
acute challenges of the glycine transporter 1 (GlyT1) inhibitor ALX-5407 (0.01,
0.1 and 1 mg/kg) or vehicle, in combination with L-DOPA, after which the severity
of dyskinesia, PLBs and parkinsonian disability was evaluated. In combination
with L-DOPA, ALX-5407 0.1 and 1 mg/kg significantly reduced the severity of
dyskinesia, by 51% and 41% (both P < 0.001), when compared to vehicle. ALX-5407
0.01, 0.1 and 1 mg/kg also decreased the severity of global PLBs, by 25%, 51% and
38% (all P < 0.001), when compared to vehicle. The benefits on dyskinesia and
PLBs were achieved without compromising the therapeutic effect of L-DOPA on
parkinsonism. Our results suggest that GlyT1 inhibition may be a novel strategy
to attenuate dyskinesia and PLBs in PD, without interfering with L-DOPA
anti-parkinsonian action.

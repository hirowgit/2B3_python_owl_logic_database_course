RATIONALE: LY354740 is a recently developed metabotropic glutamatergic receptor 2
and 3 (mGluR2/3) agonist. A high density of mGluR2 has been reported in terminal 
fields of the perforant path in rodents and humans, suggesting its involvement in
cognitive functions mediated by the temporal lobe, including memory. A small
number of in vivo studies in rodents have assessed the effects of LY354740 on
memory tasks, reporting the induction of impaired memory for spatial orientation 
in a water maze task and for delayed match and non-match to position in an
operant version of these tasks.
OBJECTIVE: In the present primate study, we used radioautography to describe the 
distribution and intensity of (3)H-LY354740 binding in the hippocampal formation 
of the common marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus) relative to the rat. In the
major, in vivo part of the study, the effects of systemic LY354740 on
computerized tasks of attention and memory were investigated.
METHODS: Adult common marmosets were trained to perform a five-choice serial
reaction time (5-CSRT) task and a concurrent delayed match-to-position (CDMP)
task from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Automated test Battery (CANTAB).
Filter tests of LY354740 effects on motor dexterity and motivation for reward
revealed high inter-individual variation in sensitivity; therefore, on the
5-CSRT, subjects were tested at a dose range of 3--10 mg/kg, and on the CDMP,
subjects were tested at 1--3 or 3--10 mg/kg.
RESULTS: Radioautography revealed a relatively low level of (3)H-LY354740 binding
in the marmoset hippocampal formation compared to the rat. Despite low binding,
LY354740 reduced sustained-attention accuracy in the 5-CSRT, and reduced accuracy
in two stages of the CDMP.
CONCLUSIONS: The current study provides novel evidence for the importance of
mGluR2/3 in the regulation of primate cognitive functioning.

In common marmoset monkeys (Callithrix jacchus, order Primates), infants aged
2-28 days were deprived of parental care for 30-120 min/day in order to
investigate the long-term effects of this neglect-stress model on affect and
cognition in a primate species. Basal morning levels of urinary cortisol across
the first year of life were unaffected in early deprived marmosets relative to
their sibling controls. Basal morning levels of urinary dopamine were chronically
increased. This peripheral increase in dopamine activity could represent a marker
for central dopamine hyperactivity. Certainly, subadult early deprived marmosets 
exhibited performance deficits in two dopamine-regulated neuropsychological
tasks. They demonstrated: (1) impaired behavioral inhibition in an object
reaching with detour task, exhibiting significantly more nonreinforced forward
reaches to a reward visible inside a cube that could only be retrieved through an
opening to the side of the cube; and (2) impaired reversal learning in a two-way 
discrimination task based on visual icons presented on a touch-sensitive computer
screen. These findings provide further evidence for the relevance of this novel
primate model of parent-infant neglect to the environmental causes and mechanisms
of human developmental psychopathology.

The viability of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) depends on energy generated by 
its respiratory chain. Cytochrome bc1-aa3 oxidase and type-2 NADH dehydrogenase
(NDH-2) are respiratory chain components predicted to be essential, and
are currently targeted for drug development. Here we demonstrate that an Mtb
cytochrome bc1-aa3 oxidase deletion mutant is viable and only partially
attenuated in mice. Moreover, treatment of Mtb-infected marmosets with a
cytochrome bc1-aa3 oxidase inhibitor controls disease progression and reduces
lesion-associated inflammation, but most lesions become cavitary. Deletion of
both NDH-2 encoding genes (Δndh-2 mutant) reveals that the essentiality of NDH-2 
as shown in standard growth media is due to the presence of fatty acids. The
Δndh-2 mutant is only mildly attenuated in mice and not differently susceptible
to clofazimine, a drug in clinical use proposed to engage NDH-2. These results
demonstrate the intrinsic plasticity of Mtb's respiratory chain, and highlight
the challenges associated with targeting the pathogen's respiratory enzymes for
tuberculosis drug development.

Callithrix jacchus and C. penicillata marmosets are invasive to the state of Rio 
de Janeiro, Brazil, threatening the native and vulnerable C. aurita. Both
invasive species can be hosts of Trypanosoma cruzi, T. minasense, T. rangeli and 
T. devei. We aim to investigate the occurrence of trypanosomatids in Callithrix
sp. from Jardim Botânico do Rio de Janeiro, located in a central and populous
area of the city. Fifteen marmosets were captured. Blood samples were collected
for light microscopy and molecular genetics analysis. Parasites morphometric
values were evaluated for species identification. DNA was extracted from blood
samples by phenol-chloroform method, for partial amplification of the 18S rRNA
gene. PCR products were sequenced and aligned using BLAST®. A maximum likelihood 
phylogenetic tree was constructed to analyze the proximity between the observed
sequences. By light microscopy, trypomastigotes were detected in five of the
fifteen marmosets. Morphometric measurements and size polymorphism corresponded
to those previously described for T. minasense. The DNA sequences of
approximately 600 base pairs of the 18S rRNA gene were obtained for three samples
with 99% identity with T. minasense sequence, forming a cluster in the
phylogenetic tree and corroborating morphometric analysis. Trypanosoma minasense 
is a highly specific parasite to non-human primates considered as non-pathogenic.
There is no evidence of infection in humans and these parasite findings from
invasive marmosets do not support additional risks for the native species.

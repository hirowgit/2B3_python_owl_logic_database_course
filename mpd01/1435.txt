BACKGROUND AND METHODS: Sera were tested for Brucella spp., Leptospira spp. and
Toxoplasma gondii antibodies in 68 free-ranging New World monkeys from a forest
fragment of the Brazilian Cerrado.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: All animals were negative for Brucella spp. and
Leptospira spp. However, 75% of Alouatta caraya and 16.6% of Callithrix
penicillata were positive for T. gondii. The implications for conservation and
health management are discussed.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) has attracted extensive attention for
use as a non-human primate model in biomedical research, especially in the study 
of neuropsychiatric disorders. However, behavioral test methods are still limited
in the field of marmoset research. The light-dark box is widely used for the
evaluation of anxiety in rodents, but little is known about light-dark preference
in marmosets. Here, we modified the light-dark test to study this behavior. The
modified apparatus consisted of three compartments: one transparent open area and
two closed opaque compartments. The closed compartments could be dark or light.
We found that both adult and young marmosets liked to explore the open area, but 
the young animals showed more interest than adults. Furthermore, when one of the 
closed compartments was light and the other dark, the adult marmosets showed a
preference for the dark compartment, but the young animals had no preference.
These results suggest that the exploratory behavior and the light-dark preference
in marmosets are age-dependent. Our study provides a new method to study
exploration, anxiety, and fear in marmosets.

The chromosomal location of rDNA in selected lower primates.

Henderson AS, Warburton D, Megraw-Ripley S, Atwood KC.

Hybridization in stiu was used to identify the chromosomes that carry rDNA in
representative lower primates, including the baboons, Papio cynocephalus and
Papio hamadryas; the colobus monkey, Colobus polykomos; the tree shrew, Tupaia
glis; the lemur, Lemur fulvis; the saki, Pithecia pithecia; the marmoset,
Saguinus nigricollis, and the spider monkey, Ateles geoffroyi. The marker
chromosome, common to the Cercopithecines studied to date, carries the rDNA in
the baboons. Another marker chromosome carries rDNA in a South American species, 
the spider monkey. A multichromosomal distribution of rDNA was demonstrated in
the tree shrew, lemur, saki, and marmoset. None of the rDNA-containing
chromosomes in the prosimians and New World monkeys show homology to the
chromosomes that carry rDNA in the Hominids, Pongids, or Old World monkeys.

On the sublingual structures of Tarsius (Prosimiae, Tarsiiformes) and some
platyrrhine monkeys (Platyrrhina, Simiae, Primates) with casual remarks on the
histology of the tongue. In memoriam William Charles Osman Hill.

Hofer HO.

The sublingual structures of Tarsius, Cebuella and Callithrix are studied
microscopically. Tarsius has a well developed but not specialized sublingua. In
the platyrrhine monkeys the sublingua is lacking completely, but the frenal
lamella (plica sublingualis) is very specialized. From this it is concluded that 
the sublingual organ of Callicebus is a topographically modified frenal lamella, 
not a sublingua.

Evidence of an age-related increase of β-synuclein (SNCB) in several parts of the
visual system including the retina has been reported. SNCB is thought to function
as an antagonist of α-synuclein in neurodegenerative diseases, but the exact role
of SNCB remains unclear. The presented work studies two different aspects of the 
onset and role of SNCB in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). First, the
topographical and intracellular distributions of SNCB in the RPE of non-human
marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus) were evaluated in paraffin-embedded eyes and
RPE whole mounts from different developmental stages (neonatal, adolescent, and
adult). Thus, revealed distinct lifetime-related alterations of the topographical
and intracellular distributions of SNCB in the primate macula compared to the
retinal periphery. Furthermore, the function and influences of SNCB on
ARPE-19 cells and primary porcine RPE (ppRPE) cells were characterized by
exposing these cells with recombinant SNCB (rSNCB) at different concentrations.
Moreover, apoptosis, protein- and mRNA-expression levels of factors of the
p53/MDM2 signaling cascade and inflammation- and oxidation-related genes were
investigated. The observed dose-depended decreased apoptosis rates together with 
the PLD2 mediated activation of the p53 pathway promotes senescence-related
processes in SNCB exposed common ARPE-19 cells from human origin. Further,
increased HMOX1 and NOX4 levels indicate increased oxidative stress and
inflammatory responses triggered by SNCB. The obtained differences in the
distribution of SNCB in primate RPE together with alterations of cellular
functions in rSNCB-exposed RPE cells (e.g., ARPE-19, ppRPE) support SNCB-related 
effects like inflammatory response and stress-related properties on RPE over
lifetime. The possible functional relevance of SNCB in physiological aging
converting into a pathophysiological condition should be investigated in further 
studies.

Background: Parkinson's disease (PD) patients frequently present gastrointestinal
(GI) dysfunction that, in many cases, predates the onset of motor symptoms. In
PD, the presynaptic protein alpha-synuclein (α-syn) undergoes pathological
changes, including phosphorylation and aggregation leading to the formation of
Lewy bodies, which can be found in neurons of the enteric nervous system (ENS).
Inflammation has been proposed as a possible trigger of α-syn pathology.
Interestingly, patients with inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel
syndrome, conditions associated with GI inflammation, are at higher risk of
developing PD. Captive common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) develop colitis,
providing a natural platform to assess the relationship between α-syn pathology
and GI inflammation. Materials and Methods: Sections of proximal colon from
marmosets with colitis (n=5; 5.3±2.3 years old; 4 male) and normal controls (n=5;
4.1±1.6 years old; 1 male) were immunostained against protein gene product 9.5
(PGP9.5), human leukocyte antigen DR (HLA-DR), cluster of differentiation 3
(CD3), cluster of differentiation 20 (CD20), glial fibrillary acidic protein
(GFAP), 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), α-syn, and serine 129
phosphorylated α-syn (p-α-syn). Immunoreactivity of each staining in the
myenteric plexus was quantified using NIH ImageJ software. Results: Marmosets
with colitis had significantly increased expression of inflammatory markers
(HLA-DR, p<0.02; CD3, p<0.008), oxidative stress (8-OHdG, p<0.05), and p-α-syn
(p<0.02) and decreased expression of α-syn (p<0.04) in the colonic myenteric
ganglia compared to normal, healthy controls. Conclusion: Colonic inflammation is
associated with changes in α-syn expression and phosphorylation in the myenteric 
plexus of common marmosets. Future evaluation of the vagus nerve and brain of
animals with colitis will be key to assess the contribution of colitis-induced
ENS α-syn pathology to PD-like pathology in the brain.

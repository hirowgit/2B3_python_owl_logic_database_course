Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) causes sporadic zoonotic 
disease and healthcare-associated outbreaks in human. MERS is often complicated
by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi-organ failure(1,2). The
high incidence of renal failure in MERS is a unique clinical feature not often
found in other human coronavirus infections(3,4). Whether MERS-CoV infects the
kidney and how it triggers renal failure are not understood(5,6). Here, we
demonstrated renal infection and apoptotic induction by MERS-CoV in human ex vivo
organ culture and a nonhuman primate model. High-throughput analysis revealed
that the cellular genes most significantly perturbed by MERS-CoV have previously 
been implicated in renal diseases. Furthermore, MERS-CoV induced apoptosis
through upregulation of Smad7 and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) expression in
both kidney and lung cells. Conversely, knockdown of Smad7 effectively inhibited 
MERS-CoV replication and protected cells from virus-induced cytopathic effects.
We further demonstrated that hyperexpression of Smad7 or FGF2 induced a strong
apoptotic response in kidney cells. Common marmosets infected by MERS-CoV
developed ARDS and disseminated infection in kidneys and other organs. Smad7 and 
FGF2 expression were elevated in the lungs and kidneys of the infected animals.
Our results provide insights into the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV and host targets
for treatment.

Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors are small in diameter, diffuse easily in the
brain, and represent a highly efficient means by which to transfer a transgene to
the brain of a large animal. A major demerit of AAV vectors is their limited
accommodation capacity for transgenes. Thus, a compact promoter is useful when
delivering large transgenes via AAV vectors. In the present study, we aimed to
identify the shortest astrocyte-specific GFAP promoter region that could be used 
for AAV-vector-mediated transgene expression in the marmoset brain. The 2.0-kb
promoter region upstream of the GFAP gene was cloned from the marmoset genome,
and short promoters (1.6 kb, 1.4 kb, 0.6 kb, 0.3 kb and 0.2 kb) were obtained by 
progressively deleting the original 2.0-kb promoter from the 5' end. The short
promoters were screened in the mouse cerebellum in terms of their strength and
astrocyte specificity. We found that the 0.3-kb promoter maintained 40% of the
strength of the original 2.0-kb promoter, and approximately 90% of its astrocyte 
specificity. These properties were superior to those of the 1.4-kb, 0.6-kb (20%
promoter strength) and 0.2-kb (70% astrocyte specificity) promoters. Then, we
verified whether the 0.3-kb GFAP promoter retained astrocyte specificity in the
marmoset cerebral cortex. Injection of viral vectors carrying the 0.3-kb marmoset
GFAP promoter specifically transduced astrocytes in both the cerebral cortex and 
cerebellar cortex of the marmoset. These results suggest that the compact 0.3-kb 
promoter region serves as an astrocyte-specific promoter in the marmoset brain,
which permits us to express a large gene by AAV vectors that have a limited
accommodation capacity.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a small New World monkey, has the
potential for use in human drug development due to its evolutionary closeness to 
humans. Four novel cDNAs, encoding cytochrome P450 (P450) 2C18, 2C19, 2C58, and
2C76, were cloned from marmoset livers to characterize P450 2C molecular
properties, including previously reported P450 2C8. The deduced amino acid
sequence showed high sequence identities (>86%) with those of human P450 2Cs,
except for marmoset P450 2C76, which has a low sequence identity (∼70%) with any 
human P450 2Cs. Phylogenetic analysis showed that marmoset P450 2Cs were more
closely clustered with those of humans and macaques than other species
investigated. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that all of 
the marmoset P450 2C mRNAs were predominantly expressed in liver as opposed to
the other tissues tested. Marmoset P450 2C proteins were detected in liver by
immunoblotting using antibodies against human P450 2Cs. Among marmoset P450 2Cs
heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli, marmoset P450 2C19 efficiently
catalyzed human P450 2C substrates, S-warfarin, diclofenac, tolbutamide,
flurbiprofen, and omeprazole. Marmoset P450 2C19 had high Vmax and low Km values 
for S-warfarin 7-hydroxylation that were comparable to those in human liver
microsomes, indicating warfarin stereoselectivity similar to findings in humans. 
Faster in vivo S-warfarin clearance than R-warfarin after intravenous
administration of racemic warfarin (0.2 mg/kg) to marmosets was consistent with
the in vitro kinetic parameters. These results indicated that marmoset P450 2C
enzymes had functional characteristics similar to those of humans, and that P450 
2C-dependent metabolic properties are likewise similar between marmosets and
humans.

Lymphocytes express potassium channels that regulate physiological cell
functions, such as activation, proliferation and migration. Expression levels of 
K2P5.1 (TASK2; KCNK5) channels belonging to the family of two-pore domain
potassium channels have previously been correlated to the activity of
autoreactive T lymphocytes in patients with multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid
arthritis. In humans, K2P5.1 channels are upregulated upon T cell stimulation and
influence T cell effector functions. However, a further clinical translation of
targeting K2P5.1 is currently hampered by a lack of highly selective inhibitors, 
making it necessary to evaluate the impact of KCNK5 in established preclinical
animal disease models. We here demonstrate that K2P5.1 knockout (K2P5.1-/-) mice 
display no significant alterations concerning T cell cytokine production,
proliferation rates, surface marker molecules or signaling pathways. In an
experimental model of autoimmune neuroinflammation, K2P5.1-/- mice show a
comparable disease course to wild-type animals and no major changes in the
peripheral immune system or CNS compartment. A compensatory upregulation of the
potassium channels K2P3.1 and KV1.3 seems to counterbalance the deletion of
K2P5.1. As an alternative model mimicking autoimmune neuroinflammation,
experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in the common marmoset has been
proposed, especially for testing the efficacy of new potential drugs. Initial
experiments show that K2P5.1 is functionally expressed on marmoset T lymphocytes,
opening up the possibility for assessing future K2P5.1-targeting drugs.

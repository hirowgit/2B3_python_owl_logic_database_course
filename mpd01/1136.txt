Rapamycin has been shown to extend lifespan in rodent models, but the effects on 
metabolic health and function have been widely debated in both clinical and
translational trials. Prior to rapamycin being used as a treatment to extend both
lifespan and healthspan in the human population, it is vital to assess the side
effects of the treatment on metabolic pathways in animal model systems, including
a closely related non-human primate model. In this study, we found that long-term
treatment of marmoset monkeys with orally-administered encapsulated rapamycin
resulted in no overall effects on body weight and only a small decrease in fat
mass over the first few months of treatment. Rapamycin treated subjects showed no
overall changes in daily activity counts, blood lipids, or significant changes in
glucose metabolism including oral glucose tolerance. Adipose tissue displayed no 
differences in gene expression of metabolic markers following treatment, while
liver tissue exhibited suppressed G6Pase activity with increased PCK and GPI
activity. Overall, the marmosets revealed only minor metabolic consequences of
chronic treatment with rapamycin and this adds to the growing body of literature 
that suggests that chronic and/or intermittent rapamycin treatment results in
improved health span and metabolic functioning. The marmosets offer an
interesting alternative animal model for future intervention testing and
translational modeling.

Parallel visual pathways originate at the first synapse in the retina, where
cones make connections with cone bipolar cells that in turn contact ganglion
cells. There are more ganglion cell types than bipolar types, suggesting that
there must be divergence from bipolar to ganglion cells. Here we analyze the
contacts between an OFF bipolar type (DB3a) and six ganglion cell types in the
retina of the marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus). Ganglion cells were
transfected via particle-mediated gene transfer of an expression plasmid for the 
postsynaptic density 95-green fluorescent protein (PSD95-GFP), and DB3a cells
were labeled via immunohistochemistry. Ganglion cell types that fully or
partially costratified with DB3a cells included OFF parasol, OFF midget, broad
thorny, recursive bistratified, small bistratified, and large bistratified cells.
On average, the number of DB3a contacts to parasol cells (18 contacts per axon
terminal) is higher than that to other ganglion cell types (between four and
seven contacts). We estimate that the DB3a output to OFF parasol cells accounts
for at least 30% of the total DB3a output. Furthermore, we found that OFF parasol
cells receive approximately 20% of their total bipolar input from DB3a cells,
suggesting that other diffuse bipolar types also provide input to OFF parasol
cells. We conclude that DB3a cells preferentially contact OFF parasol cells but
also provide input to other ganglion cell types.

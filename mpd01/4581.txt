The involvement of parents and siblings in infant care in similarly composed
groups of common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) and cotton-top tamarins (Saguinus
oedipus) was compared during the infants' first 8 weeks of life. The results
indicate an earlier infant independence in C. jacchus than in S. oedipus due
primarily to a more frequent rejection of carried infants in C. jacchus. There
was no species difference in extent of maternal involvment in carrying infants.
However, S. oedipus fathers carried infants significantly more often during weeks
5-8 than did C. jacchus fathers. Siblings were generally more involved in infant 
care at an earlier infant age in C. jacchus than in S. oedipus.

New cytogenetic techniques in the study of primate genome evolution.

De Stefano GF, Ferrucci L.

Fixed metaphase chromosomes of different species and genera of Primates (five
species of Macaca genus and Callithrix jacchus) have been studied after Alu I
restriction enzyme digestion and DA-DAPI counterstaining, in the attempt to
determine some qualitative characteristics of their DNAs and specifically of the 
DNA localized in the heterochromatic components of the karyotypes. The results
have been discussed in the light of those already published on humans, confirming
the potentiality of this approach in the study of the phyloevolutive
relationships in Primates.

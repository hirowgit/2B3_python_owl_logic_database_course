Chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis and wasting disease in marmosets (Callithrix
jacchus).

Brack M, Rothe H.

Six marmosets (Callithrix jacchus), 20 months to 16 years old, died from a
disease characterized by weakness and paralysis of the hind legs, weight lose,
anemia and transient diarrhea. The lesions most prominent at necropsy were
subacute to chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis, subacute to chronic
pancreatitis, and generalized hemosiderosis. Chronic protein deficiency is
believed to be the underlying pathogenic mechanism, since the diet contained no
more than 15% animal protein during the last two years, and increasing the amount
of protein was accompanied by disappearance of the syndrome.

Supplemental feeding of marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) triplets.

Ziegler TE, Stein FJ, Sis RF, Coleman MS, Green JH.

In a colony of marmosets (Callithrix jacchus), all fifteen infants from five sets
of triplet births were successfully reared with their parents. Two supplemental
feedings were given each infant daily. As an alternative to hand-rearing or
foster rearing, the supplemental feeding method eliminated the time-consuming
process of hand caring for an infant on a 24-hour per day basis.

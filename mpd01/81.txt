Animal welfare is critical to buffer stress in captive animals and to ensure the 
reliability of data from studies. The most usual environmental enrichment
technique (EE) for social non-human primates is the social enrichment. However,
some experimental protocols require keeping individuals isolated, thus demanding 
other types of EE. We tested in six adult Callithrix jacchus females, single
housed for experimental purpose, the stress buffering efficacy of a structural
enrichment protocol (SEP) and SEP in combination with a foraging enrichment
(FSEP) using  fecal cortisol and behaviors to infer stress levels. Both types of 
EE improved welfare in different ways, while cortisol levels decreased with both 
EE as compared to the baseline, autogrooming, and piloerection increased after
FSEP probably due to the new foods. Therefore, these findings support alternative
practices of EE when social animals are living in isolation and reinforce the
positive role of structural and food enrichment for decreasing stress markers. It
also encourages studies on welfare with females, since its use as an animal model
has increased.

Morphofunctional characteristics of the large intestine are rarely explored to
understand the physiology, behavior and ecology of neotropical primates. In this 
study, we analyzed the histometric parameters of the large intestine of hybrid
marmosets (Callithrix sp.) captured in forest fragments of Viçosa-Brazil, under
seasonal interference. These animals were predominantly insectivorous in the
rainy season and gummivores in the dry season. Large intestine fragments were
collected and processed according to histological methods and stained with
toluidine blue for general analysis, periodic acid of Schiff (PAS) and Alcian
blue (AB) for goblet cells, Grimelius and Masson Fontana for argyrophil and
argentaffin endocrine cells. Several histometric parameters were more expressive 
in the large intestine of the rainy season marmosets: greater thickness of the
parietal layers, greater number of argyrophil and argentaffin endocrine cells,
and AB-positive goblet cells, characteristics favor secretomotor functions and
reduce the passage time of the fecal bolus, which is consistent with an
insectivorous diet. In contrast, parameters such as crypt width, height of the
absorptive cells and striated border, and the number of PAS-positive cells were
more expressive in the dry season marmosets, reflecting the need for longer
passage time for digestion and absorption of food items from tree gum, which are 
more complex and demand the action of microorganisms present in the large
intestine, as well as greater protection against the abrasive action of dietary
fibers and against microorganisms. Thus, it can be said that the marmoset's large
intestine has morphological adaptations to maximize energy intake from the diet, 
which alternates under the influence of seasonality.

BACKGROUND: Myeloid sarcoma is a rare manifestation of myeloproliferative
disorder defined as an extramedullary mass composed of myeloid precursor cells. A
9-month old, female, common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) had increased
respiratory effort.
METHODS: A complete necropsy with histology and immunohistochemistry was
performed.
RESULTS: The thymus was replaced by a firm, gray-tan mass with a faint green
tint, filling over 50% of the thoracic cavity. Sheets of granulocytes, lymphoid
cells, nucleated erythrocytes, megakaryocytes, and hematopoietic precursors of
indeterminate cell lineage replaced the thymus, perithymic connective tissue,
mediastinal adipose tissues, epicardium, and much of the myocardium. The cells
demonstrated diffuse strong cytoplasmic immunoreactivity for lysozyme, and
strong, multifocal membranous immunoreactivity for CD117.
CONCLUSION: We report the first case of a myeloid sarcoma in a common marmoset
(C. jacchus), similar to reported human cases of mediastinal myeloid sarcoma, and
present a review of myeloproliferative diseases from the veterinary literature.

BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) psychosis is encountered in as many as 50%
of patients with advanced disease. Treatment options for PD psychosis are few. In
fact, only clozapine and pimavanserin have shown efficacy in randomised
controlled trials. Clinicians are often reluctant to prescribe the former, due to
the risk of agranulocytosis, while the latter is not widely available yet.
Because it is already clinically available and exhibits high affinity for
serotonin 2A receptors, a target with which both clozapine and pimavanserin
interact, we hypothesised that the anti-depressant mirtazapine might be effective
to alleviate PD psychosis.
METHODS: Here, we tested the anti-psychotic potential of mirtazapine in the
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-lesioned common marmoset.
Five MPTP-lesioned marmosets exhibiting psychosis-like behaviours were
administered L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) in combination with
mirtazapine (0.1, 1 and 10 mg/kg) or vehicle. We also tested the effect of
mirtazapine on L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia.
RESULTS: The addition of mirtazapine 10 mg/kg to L-DOPA reduced psychosis-like
behaviours by 50% (P < 0.05) and dyskinesia by 29% (P < 0.01), when compared to
L-DOPA/vehicle. Importantly, the antipsychotic and antidyskinetic effects of
mirtazapine were achieved without hindering L-DOPA anti-parkinsonian action.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that mirtazapine may be effective to alleviate
PD psychosis and, because the drug is clinically available, clinical trials that 
would assess its anti-psychotic efficacy in PD could be rapidly undertaken,
hopefully leading to a new treatment option for this debilitating condition.

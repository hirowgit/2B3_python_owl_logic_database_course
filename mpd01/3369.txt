Marmosets normally produce dizygotic twins sharing placental blood vessels and
exchanging bone marrow cells. Each individual is therefore likely to be a blood
chimaera. To date, marmosets had only been DNA fingerprinted using blood samples 
and probes 33.6 and 33.15, resulting in highly similar fingerprints among litter 
mates and little variation between other individuals, thereby limiting this
method's use for individual identification and parentage testing. In this study, 
novel probes were applied to detect greater polymorphism and to produce
individual-specific DNA fingerprints. As expected, blood DNA profiles of twins
and triplets were virtually identical, confirming chimaerism in this tissue and
identifying litter mates. Furthermore, these profiles were sufficiently variable 
to distinguish between sibs from different litters and between all other
individuals. To produce individual-specific DNA fingerprints, the use of DNA
extracted from tissues poor in leukocytes was essential. The findings demonstrate
that, despite extensive blood chimaerism, marmoset colonies can be effectively
DNA fingerprinted for indicidual identification, zygosity testing, and
relationship studies.

We report on the diet and feeding behaviour of a group of Geoffroy's marmosets
(Callithrix geoffroyi) in an Atlantic forest fragment in south-eastern Brazil,
studied during the period February 1993 to Januaray 1994. Major food categories
were gums (68.6%) fruits (15%), and small animal prey (invertebrates 14.6% and
vertebrates 0.8%). Dietary changes were observed between the wet and dry seasons,
although they were not statistically significant. Insects and gums were consumed 
throughout the year but fruits were more prevalent in the diet in the wet season.
Plant species exploited for their gums includedInga stipularis, followed byAcacia
paniculata, Paulinia carpopodia, andBauhinia angulosa. Chemical analysis of the
gum of the four species most used all presented high values for carbohydrates and
crude proteins. Fruits of an unidentified species of Myrtaceae (sp. 2) were
consumed the most. Animal prey consisted mainly of insects, arachnids, snails,
and in three cases, lizards and frogs, with orthopterans being the most prevalent
insect prey. This study demonstrates thatC. geoffroyi efficiently exploits
resources typically available in secondary and disturbed forest habitat. The main
threat to the species is forest destruction, degradation, and fragmentation, but 
the management of small forest fragments may be an effective corservation
strategy.

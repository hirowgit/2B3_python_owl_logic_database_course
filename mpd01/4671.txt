Canine tooth root infection as a cause of facial abscess in the common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus).

Baskerville M.

Facial abscesses in a colony of common marmosets were found to be caused by
abscessation of an upper canine tooth root. Trauma to the upper canine, resulting
in exposure of the pulp cavity, was thought to be the mode of infection.
Radiography was the most useful diagnostic aid in establishing the nature and
extent of the lesion. Antibiotic therapy alone was inadequate, and provision of
drainage by extracting the tooth, in conjunction with antibiotics, proved the
most effective treatment.

Delineation of lymphocyte subsets in lymph nodes of nonhuman primates.

Chalifoux LV, Schlossman SF, Letvin NL.

Monoclonal antibodies which recognize specific surface antigens on human
lymphocytes were used with an avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase technique to stain
lymph nodes from nonhuman primates. Cells in lymph nodes from three macaque
species and two new-world primate species could be stained to define T11, T4, T8,
and B1 lymphocyte subsets. This approach will facilitate the study of many
important spontaneous and experimentally induced diseases of nonhuman primates.

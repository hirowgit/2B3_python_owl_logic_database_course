Behavioral contagion is suggested to promote group coordination that may
facilitate activity transitions, increased vigilance, and state matching. Apart
from contagious yawning, however, very little attention has been given to this
phenomenon, and studies on contagious yawning in primates have so far only
focused on Old World monkeys and apes. Here we studied behavioral contagion in
common marmosets, a species for which group coordination and vigilance are
paramount. In particular, we investigated the contagiousness of yawning,
stretching, scratching, tongue protrusion, gnawing, and scent-marking. We coded
these behaviors from 14 adult marmosets, from two different social groups. During
testing sessions, animals were separated into groups of four individuals for
20-min observation periods, across three distinct diurnal time points (morning,
midday, and afternoon) to test for circadian patterns. We observed almost no
yawning (0.12 yawns/h) and very little stretching behavior. For all other
behaviors, which were more common, we found several temporal and inter-individual
differences (i.e., sex, age, dominance status) predictive of these responses.
Moreover, we found that gnawing and scent-marking, which almost always
co-occurred as a fixed-action pattern, were highly temporally clustered within
observation sessions. We discuss the relative absence of yawning in marmosets as 
well as the possible function of contagious scent-marking, and provide
suggestions for future research into the proximate and ultimate functions of
these behaviors in marmosets.

Age is the number one risk factor for breast cancer, yet the underlying
mechanisms are unexplored. Age-associated mammary stem cell (MaSC) dysfunction is
thought to play an important role in breast cancer carcinogenesis. Non-human
primates with their close phylogenetic relationship to humans provide a powerful 
model system to study the effects of aging on human MaSC. In particular, the
common marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus) with a relatively short life span is 
an ideal model for aging research. In the present study, we characterized for the
first time the mammary epithelial stem/progenitor cells in the common marmoset.
The MaSC-enriched cells formed four major types of morphologically distinct
colonies when cultured on plates pre-seeded with irradiated NIH3T3 fibroblasts,
and were also capable of forming mammospheres in suspension culture and
subsequent formation of 3D organoids in Matrigel culture. Most importantly, these
3D organoids were found to contain stem/progenitor cells that can undergo
self-renewal and multi-lineage differentiation both in vitro and in vivo. We also
observed a significant decrease of luminal-restricted progenitors with age. Our
findings demonstrate that common marmoset mammary stem/progenitor cells can be
isolated and quantified with established in vitro and in vivo assays used for
mouse and human studies.

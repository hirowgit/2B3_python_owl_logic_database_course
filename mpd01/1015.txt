Currently, the amount of sequenced and classified MHC class I genes of the common
marmoset is limited, in spite of the wide use of this species as an animal model 
for biomedical research. In this study, 480 clones of MHC class I G locus
(Caja-G) cDNA sequences were obtained from 21 common marmosets. Up to 10
different alleles were detected in each common marmoset, leading to the
assumption that the Caja-G loci duplicated in the marmoset genome. In the
investigated population, four alleles occurred more often, giving evidence for
higher immunological advantage of these alleles. In contrast to the human
non-classical MHC class I genes, Caja-G shows high rates of polymorphism at the
relevant peptide-binding sites, despite its phylogenetic relationship to the
non-classical HLA-G. Our results provide information for better understanding of 
the immunological properties of the common marmoset and confirm the theory of a
gene conversion of the Caja-G due to its detected plasticity and the absence of
any known HLA-A equivalent.

Comparative cytogenetic analysis in New World Monkeys (NWMs) using human
multicolor banding (MCB) probe sets were not previously done. Here we report on
an MCB based FISH-banding study complemented with selected locus-specific and
heterochromatin specific probes in four NWMs and one Old World Monkey (OWM)
species, i.e. in Alouatta caraya (ACA), Callithrix jacchus (CJA), Cebus apella
(CAP), Saimiri sciureus (SSC), and Chlorocebus aethiops (CAE), respectively. 107 
individual evolutionary conserved breakpoints (ECBs) among those species were
identified and compared with those of other species in previous reports.
Especially for chromosomal regions being syntenic to human chromosomes 6, 8, 9,
10, 11, 12 and 16 previously cryptic rearrangements could be observed. 50.4%
(54/107) NWM-ECBs were colocalized with those of OWMs, 62.6% (62/99) NWM-ECBs
were related with those of Hylobates lar (HLA) and 66.3% (71/107) NWM-ECBs
corresponded with those known from other mammalians. Furthermore, human fragile
sites were aligned with the ECBs found in the five studied species and
interestingly 66.3% ECBs colocalized with those fragile sites (FS). Overall, this
study presents detailed chromosomal maps of one OWM and four NWM species. This
data will be helpful to further investigation on chromosome evolution in NWM and 
hominoids in general and is prerequisite for correct interpretation of future
sequencing based genomic studies in those species.

Although deep brain electrical stimulation can alleviate the motor symptoms of
Parkinson disease (PD), just a small fraction of patients with PD can take
advantage of this procedure due to its invasive nature. A significantly less
invasive method--epidural spinal cord stimulation (SCS)--has been suggested as an
alternative approach for symptomatic treatment of PD. However, the mechanisms
underlying motor improvements through SCS are unknown. Here, we show that SCS
reproducibly alleviates motor deficits in a primate model of PD. Simultaneous
neuronal recordings from multiple structures of the cortico-basal
ganglia-thalamic loop in parkinsonian monkeys revealed abnormal highly
synchronized neuronal activity within each of these structures and excessive
functional coupling among them. SCS disrupted this pathological circuit behavior 
in a manner that mimics the effects caused by pharmacological dopamine
replacement therapy or deep brain stimulation. These results suggest that SCS
should be considered as an additional treatment option for patients with PD.

The effect of a high (chocolate) versus low fat/sugar (chow) food on a
conditioned-place-preference (CPP) task was evaluated in marmoset monkeys.
Anxiety-related behaviors and cortisol levels before and after the CPP task were 
also measured. Subjects were habituated to a two-compartment CPP box and then, on
alternate days, had access to only one compartment during daily 15-min
conditionings, for a total of 14 trials. Marmosets were provisioned with
chocolate chips in the CC-paired compartment on odd-numbered trials and standard 
chow in the CW-paired compartment on even-numbered trials. They were then tested 
for preferring the CC-paired context after a 24-h interval. During the
conditioning, a significantly greater amount (in kcal/trial) of chocolate was
consumed than chow, yet the foraging pattern of both food types was similar. On
the test trial, the time spent in the CC-paired context increased significantly
compared to pre-CPP levels, yet this response was not readily predicted by
baseline behavioral or cortisol levels. Also, the chocolate CPP response was
positively correlated with foraging time, rather than the amount of calories
consumed. The sudden absence of the food increased exploration, while the
chocolate CPP effect was associated with vigilance - both anxiety-related
behaviors in marmosets. This behavioral profile occurred regardless of any
concomitant change or correlation with cortisol. Therefore, the high fat/sugar
food was more prone to be overly consumed by the marmosets, to induce a CPP
response and to lead to anxiety-related behavior in its absence.

This is the second report of a series paper, which reports molecular mechanisms
underlying the occurrence of pruning spine phase after rapid spinogenesis phase
in neonates and young infant in the primate brain. We performed microarray
analysis between the peak of spine numbers [postnatal 3 months (M)] and spine
pruning (postnatal 6M) in prefrontal, inferior temporal, and primary visual
cortices of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). The pruning phase is not
clearly defined in rodents but is in primates including the marmoset. The
differentially expressed genes between 3M and 6M in all three cortical areas were
selected by two-way analysis of variance. The list of selected genes was analyzed
by canonical pathway analysis using "Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of complex omics 
data" (IPA; Ingenuity Systems, Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). In this report, we
discuss these lists of genes for the glutamate receptor system, G-protein-coupled
neuromodulator system, protector of normal tissue and mitochondria, and reelin.
(1) Glutamate is a common neurotransmitter. Its receptors AMPA1, GRIK1, and their
scaffold protein DLG4 decreased as spine numbers decreased. Instead, GRIN3 (NMDA 
receptor) increased, suggesting that strong NMDA excitatory currents may be
required for a single neuron to receive sufficient net synaptic activity in order
to compensate for the decrease in synapse. (2) Most of the G protein-coupled
receptor genes (e.g., ADRA1D, HTR2A, HTR4, and DRD1) in the selected list were
upregulated at 6M. The downstream gene ROCK2 in these receptor systems plays a
role of decreasing synapses, and ROCK2 decreased at 6M. (3) Synaptic phagosytosis
by microglia with complement and other cytokines could cause damage to normal
tissue and mitochondria. SOD1, XIAP, CD46, and CD55, which play protective roles 
in normal tissue and mitochondria, showed higher expression at 6M than at 3M,
suggesting that normal brain tissue is more protected at 6M. (4) Reelin has an
important role in cortical layer formation. In addition, RELN and three different
pathways of reelin were expressed at 6M, suggesting that new synapse formation
decreased at that age. Moreover, if new synapses were formed, their positions
were free and probably dependent on activity.

Encapsulation of stem cells in alginate beads is promising as a sophisticated
drug delivery system in treatment of a wide range of acute and chronic diseases. 
However, common use of air flow encapsulation of cells in alginate beads fails to
produce beads with narrow size distribution, intact spherical structure and
controllable sizes that can be scaled up. Here we show that high voltage
encapsulation (≥ 15 kV) can be used to reproducibly generate spherical alginate
beads (200-400 μm) with narrow size distribution (± 5-7%) in a controlled manner 
under optimized process parameters. Flow rate of alginate solution ranged from
0.5 to 10 ml/h allowed producing alginate beads with a size of 320 and 350 μm
respectively, suggesting that this approach can be scaled up. Moreover, we found 
that applied voltages (15-25 kV) did not alter the viability and proliferation of
encapsulated mesenchymal stem cells post-encapsulation and cryopreservation as
compared to air flow. We are the first who employed a comparative analysis of
electro-spraying and air flow encapsulation to study the effect of high voltage
on alginate encapsulated cells. This report provides background in application of
high voltage to encapsulate living cells for further medical purposes. Long-term 
comparison and work on alginate-cell interaction within these structures will be 
forthcoming.

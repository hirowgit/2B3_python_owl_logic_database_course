Heart failure is one of the most common causes of morbidity and mortality. Both
maturational abnormalities and age-associated cardiac pathologies contribute to
heart failure. Imaging-based assessment to discern detailed cardiac structure at 
various maturational stages is imperative for understanding mechanisms behind
cardiac growth and aging. Using multiphoton nonlinear optical microscopy (NLOM)
based label-free imaging, we investigated cardiac structural composition in a
human-relevant aging model, the common marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus).
Animals were divided into three different age groups including neonatal, young
adult and old. By devising a unique strategy for segregating collagen and myosin 
emitted second harmonic generation (SHG) signals, we performed a volumetric
assessment of collagen and total scattering tissue (collagen + myosin). Aged
marmoset hearts exhibited an increase in collagen and total scattering tissue
volume at the sites of severe tissue remodelling indicating age-related cardiac
fibrosis. Significantly low scattering tissue volume in neonatal marmoset hearts 
was attributed to a lack of binding between the myofibrils in maturing cardiac
tissue. Comprehensive quantitative assessment of structural composition during
maturation and aging of marmoset hearts revealed significant differences in
myofibril length, alignment, curvature and angular distribution. In conclusion,
label-free high-resolution NLOM facilitates visualization and quantification of
subcellular structural features for understanding vital age-related morphological
alterations in the marmoset heart.

In 2019, a new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was detected in China. Severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was capable to infect domestic
and captive mammals like cats, tigers and minks. Due to genetic similarities,
concern about the infection of non-human primates (NHPs) and the establishment of
a sylvatic cycle has grown in the Americas. In this study, neotropical primates
(NP) were sampled in different areas from Brazil to investigate whether they were
infected by SARS-CoV-2. A total of 89 samples from 51 NP of four species were
examined. No positive samples were detected via RT-qPCR, regardless of the NHP
species, tissue or habitat tested. This work provides the first report on the
lack of evidence of the circulation of SARS-CoV-2 in NP. The expansion of wild
animals sampling is necessary to understand their role in the epidemiology of
SARS-CoV-2 and other potentially zoonotic pathogens in natural environments
shared by humans.

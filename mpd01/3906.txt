The existence of follicles with a "super flat" epithelium and the large number of
primary and especially secondary lysosomes and lipofuscin granules in these cells
are characteristic features of the thyroid gland of adult marmosets (Callithrix
jacchus, new-world monkeys). It is supposed that these morphological findings are
indications of a relatively low function and early ageing.

A satellite DNA has been cloned from the neotropical primate Callithrix argentata
and designated CarB. The presence of the satellite was assayed in New and Old
World primates by blot hybridization: CarB is highly amplified in the genomes of 
all three species belonging to the C. argentata species group (C. argentata, C.
emiliae, C. humeralifer), but is either absent, or present in only minor amounts,
in other primates, including the closely related species, C. jacchus. A
completely sequenced CarB monomeric unit was 1528 bp in length and mapped to the 
telomeric C-band-positive regions of many C. argentata species group chromosomes.
Sequence data from eight CarB clones indicated an average difference of 3.5% when
base substitutions alone were counted. The hybridization and sequence data
suggest that this satellite underwent a period of amplification and dispersal in 
the genome of a recent ancestor of the C. argentata species group.

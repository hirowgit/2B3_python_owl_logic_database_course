In this study the morphological changes in the livers of marmosets inoculated
with stool extracts from epidemic non-A, non-B hepatitis patients in India were
examined. The histologic changes of epidemic non-A, non-B hepatitis in marmosets 
consisted mainly of round cell infiltration in the portal tracts, spotty liver
cell necrosis, sinusoidal lymphocyte infiltration, and Kupffer cell mobilization.
By electron microscopy, liver cells from infected marmosets showed cisternal
dilation of the endoplasmic reticulum, irregularly-shaped nucleus, and
disorganization of the mitochondrial cristae. In some areas interaction of
lymphocytes with hepatocytes was observed. Similar observations have been made in
type B hepatitis infection, presumably due to liver cell damage mediated by
immune mechanisms. The result of our study is also compatible with the
interpretation that the liver cell damage in this experimental model may be
mediated by immune mechanisms.

Serum protein electrophoretic patterns of the marmoset, Callithrix jacchus.

Allchin JP, Evans GO.

Three electrophoretic procedures were used to separate protein fractions of
marmoset serum. The albumin of marmoset serum migrated further than that of human
serum with all three procedures and the number and size of the globulin fractions
differed with species and with procedure.

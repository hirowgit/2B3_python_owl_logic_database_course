Cooperatively breeding common marmosets show substantial variation in the amount 
of help they provide. Pay-to-stay and social prestige models of helping attribute
this variation to audience effects, i.e. that individuals help more if group
members can witness their interactions with immatures, whereas models of kin
selection, group augmentation or those stressing the need to gain parenting
experience do not predict any audience effects. We quantified the readiness of
adult marmosets to share food in the presence or absence of other group members. 
Contrary to both predictions, we found a reverse audience effect on food-sharing 
behaviour: marmosets would systematically share more food with immatures when no 
audience was present. Thus, helping in common marmosets, at least in related
family groups, does not support the pay-to-stay or the social prestige model, and
helpers do not take advantage of the opportunity to engage in reputation
management. Rather, the results appear to reflect a genuine concern for the
immatures' well-being, which seems particularly strong when solely responsible
for the immatures.

BACKGROUND: A vaccine against all four dengue virus (DENV) serotypes includes the
formulation of one genotype of each serotype. Although genetic similarities among
genotypes within a serotype are higher as compared to those among serotypes,
differences in the immunogenicity of the included genotypes would be a critical
issue in maximizing successful dengue vaccine development. Thus, we determined
the neutralizing antibody responses against three genotypes of dengue virus
serotype 2 (DENV-2), namely Cosmopolitan, Asian I, and Asian/American, after
primary and secondary inoculation with DENV-2 in a dengue animal model, the
common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).
METHODS: A total of fifty-four plasma samples were obtained from thirty-four
marmosets that were inoculated with clinically-isolated DENV strains or DENV
candidate vaccines, were used in this study. Plasma samples were obtained from
marmosets after primary inoculation with DENV-2 infection, secondary inoculation 
with homologous or heterologous genotypes, and tertiary inoculation with
heterologous DENV. Neutralizing antibody titers against DENV-2 (Cosmopolitan,
Asian I, and Asian/American genotypes) and DENV-1 were determined using a
conventional plaque reduction neutralization assay.
RESULTS: In marmosets that were inoculated with the Cosmopolitan genotype in
primary infection, neutralizing antibody neutralized 3 genotypes, and the titers 
to Asian I genotype were significantly higher than those to homologous
Cosmopolitan genotype. After secondary DENV-2 infection with heterologous
genotype (Asian I in primary and Asian/American in secondary), neutralizing
antibody titers to Asian/American genotype was significantly higher than those
against Cosmopolitan and Asian I genotypes. Following tertiary infection with
DENV-1 following DENV-2 Asian I and Cosmopolitan genotypes, neutralizing antibody
titers to Asian/American were also significantly higher than those against
Cosmopolitan and Asian I genotypes.
CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrated that different levels of neutralizing 
antibodies were induced against variable DENV-2 genotypes after primary,
secondary and tertiary infections, and that neutralizing antibody titers to some 
heterologous genotypes were higher than those to homologous genotypes within a
serotype. The results indicate that heterogeneity and homogeneity of infecting
genotypes influence the levels and cross-reactivity of neutralizing antibodies
induced in following infections. The results also suggest that certain genotypes 
may possess advantage in terms of breakthrough infections against vaccination.

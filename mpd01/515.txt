In autism spectrum disorder (ASD), disrupted functional and structural
connectivity in the social brain has been suggested as the core biological
mechanism underlying the social recognition deficits of this neurodevelopmental
disorder. In this study, we aimed to identify genetic and neurostructural
abnormalities at birth in a non-human primate model of ASD, the common marmoset
with maternal exposure to valproic acid (VPA), which has been reported to display
social recognition deficit in adulthood. Using a comprehensive gene expression
analysis, we found that 20 genes were significantly downregulated in VPA-exposed 
neonates. Of these, Frizzled3 (FZD3) and PIK3CA were identified in an axon
guidance signaling pathway. FZD3 is essential for the normal development of the
anterior commissure (AC) and corpus callosum (CC); hence, we performed diffusion 
tensor magnetic resonance imaging with a 7-Tesla scanner to measure the
midsagittal sizes of these structures. We found that the AC size in VPA-exposed
neonates was significantly smaller than that in age-matched controls, while the
CC size did not differ. These results suggest that downregulation of the genes
related to axon guidance and decreased AC size in neonatal primates may be linked
to social brain dysfunctions that can happen later in life.

BACKGROUND: Callithrix jacchus, generally known as the common marmoset, has
recently garnered interest as an experimental primate model for better
understanding the basis of human social behavior, architecture and function.
Modelling human neurological and psychological diseases in marmosets can enhance 
the knowledge obtained from rodent research for future pre-clinical studies.
Hence, comprehensive and quantitative assessments of marmoset behaviors are
crucial. However, systems for monitoring and analyzing marmoset behaviors have
yet to be established.
NEW METHOD: In this paper, we present a novel multimodal system, MarmoDetector,
for the automated 3D analysis of marmoset behavior under freely moving
conditions. MarmoDetector allows the quantitative assessment of marmoset
behaviors using computerised tracking analysis techniques that are based on a
Kinect system equipped with video recordings, infrared images and depth analysis.
RESULTS: Using MarmoDetector, we assessed behavioral circadian rhythms
continuously over several days in home cages. In addition, MarmoDetector detected
acute, transient complex behaviors of alcohol injected marmosets.
COMPARISON TO EXISTING METHOD: Compared to 2D recording, MarmoDetector detects
activities more precisely and is very sensitive as we could detect behavioral
defects specifically induced by alcohol administration.
CONCLUSION: MarmoDetector facilitates the rapid and accurate analysis of marmoset
behavior and will enhance research on the neural basis of brain disorders.

Diffusion MR tractography permits investigating the 3D structure of cortical
pathways as interwoven paths across the entire brain. We use high-resolution
scans from diffusion spectrum imaging and high angular resolution diffusion
imaging to investigate the evolution of cortical pathways within the
euarchontoglire (i.e., primates, rodents) lineage. More specifically, we compare 
cortical fiber pathways between macaques (Macaca mulatta), marmosets (Callithrix 
jachus), and rodents (mice, Mus musculus). We integrate these observations with
comparative analyses of Neurofilament heavy polypeptide (NEFH) expression across 
the cortex of mice and primates. We chose these species because their
phylogenetic position serves to trace the early evolutionary history of the human
brain. Our comparative analysis from diffusion MR tractography, cortical white
matter scaling, and NEFH expression demonstrates that the examined primates
deviate from mice in possessing increased long-range cross-cortical projections, 
many of which course across the anterior to posterior axis of the cortex. Our
study shows that integrating gene expression data with diffusion MR data is an
effective approach in identifying variation in connectivity patterns between
species. The expansion of corticocortical pathways and increased anterior to
posterior cortical integration can be traced back to an extension of neurogenetic
schedules during development in primates.

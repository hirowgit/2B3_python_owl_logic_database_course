Personality in animals has been extensively researched in recent decades.
Temporal consistency of behaviors is almost always part of the personality
definition and is usually explored in several different testing sessions or
observation periods. However, it is still unclear whether the obtained
personality constructs are stable across several years, which might be especially
important for long-living animals, such as primates. Further, little is known on 
whether the personality structures obtained in the laboratory reflect the
structures obtained under ecologically relevant conditions in the wild.
Therefore, we conducted a battery of personality tests on common marmosets
(Callithrix jacchus) (N = 27), compared it with a test battery conducted 4 years 
beforehand on a subset of animals in captivity (N = 13) and ran an adapted
version under field conditions at Baracuhy Biological Field Station, Brazil
(N = 18). Under captive conditions, we found a remarkably similar personality
structure across 4 testing years. Further, we found high long-term temporal
consistency in the first two personality components, Boldness and Exploration;
however, monkeys that changed their social (i.e., breeding) status between the
two testing periods showed a significant increase in Boldness scores. Under field
conditions, we found a somewhat similar personality structure as compared to the 
laboratory, which to some extent corroborates ecological validity of our
personality test design. Nevertheless, whether the structure in the wild is
suppressed or expanded in comparison to captivity, and in which way the social
setting influences personality structure, should be further explored. Taken
together, our results contribute to the discussion about the reliability and
ecological validity of personality structures in nonhuman primates.

Common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) are small non-human primates that
genetically lack cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9). Polymorphic marmoset CYP2C19
compensates by mediating oxidations of typical human CYP2C9/19
substrates.Twenty-four probe substrates were intravenously administered in
combinations to marmosets assigned to extensive or poor metaboliser (PM) groups
by CYP2C19 genotyping. Eliminations from plasma of cilomilast, phenytoin,
repaglinide, tolbutamide, and S-warfarin in the CYP2C19 PM group were
significantly slow; these drugs are known substrates of human CYP2C8/9/19.Human
total clearance values and volumes of distribution of the 24 test compounds were 
extrapolated using single-species allometric scaling with experimental data from 
marmosets and found to be mostly comparable with the reported values.Human total 
clearance values and volumes of distribution of 15 of the 24 test compounds
similarly extrapolated using reported data sets from cynomolgus or rhesus monkeys
were comparable to the present predicted results, especially to those based on
data from PM marmosets.These results suggest that single-species allometric
scaling using marmosets, being small, has advantages over multiple-species-based 
allometry and could be applicable for pharmacokinetic predictions at the
discovery stage of drug development.

The circadian timing system (CTS) anticipates optimal physiological patterns in
response to environmental fluctuations, such as light-dark cycle. Since
age-related disruption of circadian synchronization is linked to several
pathological conditions, we characterized alterations of neurochemical
constituents and retinal projections to the major pacemaker of CTS, the
suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), in adult and aged marmosets. We used intraocular
injections of neural tracer Cholera toxin b (CTb) to report age-related
reductions in CTb, neuropeptide Y and serotonin immunoreactivities. Considering
these projections arise in SCN from nuclei that relay environmental information
to entrain the circadian clock, we provide important anatomical correlates to
age-associated physiological deficits.

In a landscape fragmented by agriculture, the extent to which forest-dwelling
primates can use the matrix between fragments can be critical for their long-term
survival. So far, the golden-headed lion tamarin (Leontopithecus chrysomelas), an
endangered primate inhabiting the Atlantic Forest of south Bahia, is only known
to use shaded cacao (Theobroma cacao) agroforests within the matrix. We report on
the use of a rubber plantation by a group of golden-headed lion tamarins between 
August 2013 and January 2014. The group used the rubber plantation on 16 of the
22 observation days (73 %), and we recorded behaviours such as eating, grooming
and sleeping, consistent with the use of the area as a home range. We also
observed associations with Wied's marmosets (Callithrix kuhlii). The locations of
group sightings were not uniformly spread across the entire area of the rubber
plantation, suggesting preferred use of certain areas. The presence of resources 
such as jackfruits (Artocarpus heterophyllus) and epiphytic bromeliads may be
attracting both species to these plantations. In addition to shaded cacao
plantations, rubber plantations with the appropriate structure may be a viable
option for increasing forest connectivity for both species in south Bahia,
reconciling economic rubber production with primate conservation.

Although feline platynosomosis has been commonly reported in several parts of the
world, the taxonomy and epidemiological chain related to cat liver flukes remain 
controversial. In this study, nuclear ribosomal ITS, 28S, and mitochondrial cox1 
sequences obtained for Platynosomum illiciens from cat, marmoset, lizard, and
snail found naturally infected in Brazil reveal no significant molecular
differences between these isolates. Moreover, sequence data confirm that
Brazilian P. illiciens from different hosts is conspecific with parasites
obtained from cats in Vietnam, supporting wide distribution of the species. The
lack of pronounced specificity of P. illiciens to definitive hosts is confirmed
here for the first time using molecular approach. The results are discussed in
context of the epizootology of platynosomosis.

Corepresentation During Joint Action in Marmoset Monkeys ( Callithrix jacchus).

Behavioral coordination is a fundamental element of human cooperation. It is
facilitated when individuals represent not only their own actions but also those 
of their partner. Identifying whether action corepresentation is unique to humans
or also present in other species is therefore necessary to fully understand the
evolution of human cooperation. We used the auditory joint Simon task to assess
whether action corepresentation occurs in common marmosets, a monkey species that
engages extensively in coordinated action during cooperative infant care. We
found that marmosets indeed show a joint Simon effect. Furthermore, when
coordinating their behavior in the joint task, they were more likely to look at
their partner than in a joint control condition. Corepresentation is thus not
unique to humans but also present in the cooperatively breeding marmosets. Since 
marmosets are small-brained monkeys, our results suggest that routine
coordination in space and time, rather than complex cognitive abilities, plays a 
role in the evolution of corepresentation.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common cause for sustained disability in
young adults, yet treatment options remain very limited. Although numerous
therapeutic approaches have been effective in rodent models of experimental
autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), only few proved to be beneficial in patients 
with MS. Hence, there is a strong need for more predictive animal models. Within 
the past decade, EAE in the common marmoset evolved as a potent, alternative
model for MS, with immunological and pathological features resembling more
closely the human disease. However, an often very rapid and severe disease course
hampers its implementation for systematic testing of new treatment strategies. We
here developed a new focal model of EAE in the common marmoset, induced by myelin
oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) immunization and stereotactic injections of
proinflammatory cytokines. At the injection site of cytokines, confluent
inflammatory demyelinating lesions developed that strongly resembled human MS
lesions. In a proof-of-principle treatment study with the immunomodulatory
compound laquinimod, we demonstrate that targeted EAE in marmosets provides a
promising and valid tool for preclinical experimental treatment trials in MS
research.

INTRODUCTION: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative
disorder characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons as well as the
presence of proteinaceous inclusions named Lewy bodies. α-synuclein (α-syn) is a 
major constituent of Lewy bodies, and the first disease-causing protein
characterized in PD. Several α-syn-based animal models of PD have been developed 
to investigate the pathophysiology of PD, but none of them recapitulate the full 
picture of the disease. Ageing is the most compelling and major risk factor for
developing PD but its impact on α-syn toxicity remains however unexplored. In
this study, we developed and exploited a recombinant adeno-associated viral (AAV)
vector of serotype 9 overexpressing mutated α-syn to elucidate the influence of
ageing on the dynamics of PD-related neurodegeneration associated with α-syn
pathology in different mammalian species.
RESULTS: Identical AAV pseudotype 2/9 vectors carrying the DNA for human mutant
p.A53T α-syn were injected into the substantia nigra to induce neurodegeneration 
and synucleinopathy in mice, rats and monkeys. Rats were used first to validate
the ability of this serotype to replicate α-syn pathology and second to
investigate the relationship between the kinetics of α-syn-induced nigrostriatal 
degeneration and the progressive onset of motor dysfunctions, strikingly
reminiscent of the impairments observed in PD patients. In mice, AAV2/9-hα-syn
injection into the substantia nigra was associated with accumulation of α-syn and
phosphorylated hα-syn, regardless of mouse strain. However, phenotypic mutants
with either accelerated senescence or resistance to senescence did not display
differential susceptibility to hα-syn overexpression. Of note, p-α-syn levels
correlated with nigrostriatal degeneration in mice. In monkeys, hα-syn-induced
degeneration of the nigrostriatal pathway was not affected by the age of the
animals. Unlike mice, monkeys did not exhibit correlations between levels of
phosphorylated α-syn and neurodegeneration.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, AAV2/9-mediated hα-syn induces robust nigrostriatal
neurodegeneration in mice, rats and monkeys, allowing translational comparisons
among species. Ageing, however, neither exacerbated nigrostriatal
neurodegeneration nor α-syn pathology per se. Our unprecedented multi-species
investigation thus favours the multiple-hit hypothesis for PD wherein ageing
would merely be an aggravating, additive, factor superimposed upon an independent
disease process.

Marmosets have attracted significant interest in the life sciences. Similarities 
with human brain anatomy and physiology, such as the granular frontal cortex, as 
well as the development of transgenic lines and potential for transferring rodent
neuroscientific techniques to small primates make them a promising
neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric model system. However, whether marmosets
can exhibit complex motor tasks in highly controlled experimental designs-one of 
the prerequisites for investigating higher-order control mechanisms underlying
cognitive motor behavior-has not been demonstrated. We show that marmosets can be
trained to perform vocal behavior in response to arbitrary visual cues in
controlled operant conditioning tasks. Our results emphasize the marmoset as a
suitable model to study complex motor behavior and the evolution of cognitive
control underlying speech.

We proposed a generic template-derived approach for (semi-) automated brain
extraction in animal MRI studies and evaluated our implementation with different 
animal models (macaque, marmoset, rodent) and MRI protocols (T1, T2). While
conventional MR-neuroimaging studies perform brain extraction as an initial step 
priming subsequent image-registration from subject to template, our proposed
approach propagates an anatomical template to (whole-head) individual subjects in
reverse order, which is challenging due to the surrounding extracranial tissue,
greater differences in contrast pattern and larger areas with field
inhomogeneity. As a novel approach, the herein introduced brain extraction
algorithm derives whole-brain segmentation using rigid and non-rigid deformation 
based on unbiased anatomical atlas building with a priori estimates from
study-cohort and an initial approximate brain extraction. We evaluated our
proposed method in comparison to several other technical approaches including
"Marker based watershed scalper", "Brain-Extraction-Tool", "3dSkullStrip",
"Primatologist-Toolbox", "Rapid Automatic Tissue Segmentation" and "Robust
automatic rodent brain extraction using 3D pulse-coupled neural networks" with
manual skull-stripping as reference standard. ABX demonstrated best performance
with accurate (≥92%) and consistent results throughout datasets and across
species, age and MRI protocols. ABX was made available to the public with
documentation, templates and sample material (

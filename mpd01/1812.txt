Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) is essential for maintenance
of the episome and establishment of latency. In this study, we observed that heat
treatment effectively induced EBNA1 transcription in EBV-transformed B95-8 and
human LCL cell lines. Although Cp is considered as the sole promoter used for the
expression of EBNA1 transcripts in the lymphoblastoid cell lines, the RT-PCR
results showed that the EBNA1 transcripts induced by heat treatment arise from
Qp-initiated transcripts. Using bioinformatics, a high affinity and functional
heat shock factor 1 (HSF1)-binding element within the -17/+4 oligonucleotide of
the Qp was found, and was determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and 
chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Moreover, heat shock and exogenous HSF1
expression induced Qp activity in reporter assays. Further, RNA
interference-mediated HSF1 gene silencing attenuated heat-induced EBNA1
expression in B95-8 cells. These results provide evidence that EBNA1 is a new
target for the transcription factor HSF1.

The core pathogenic process in the common marmoset model of multiple sclerosis
(MS) is the activation of memory-like T cells specific for peptide 34 to 56
derived from the extracellular domain of myelin/oligodendrocyte glycoprotein
(MOG(34-56)). Immunization with MOG(34-56) in incomplete Freund's adjuvant is a
sufficient stimulus for in vivo activation of these T cells, together with the
induction of MS-like disease and CNS pathology. Ex vivo functional
characteristics of MOG(34-56) specific T cells are specific cytolysis of peptide 
pulsed target cells and high IL-17A production. To indentify possible functions
in this new model of T helper 1 cells, which play a central pathogenic role in MS
models induced with complete Freund's adjuvant, we tested the effect of human
interferon-γ (IFNγ) administration during disease initiation of the disease (day 
0-25) and around the time of disease expression (psd 56-81). The results show a
clear modulatory effect of early IFNγ treatment on humoral and cellular
autoimmune parameters, but no generalized mitigating effect on the disease
course. These results argue against a prominent pathogenic role of T helper 1
cells in this new marmoset EAE model.

While the fundamental importance of the white matter in supporting neuronal
communication is well known, existing publications of primate brains do not
feature a detailed description of its complex anatomy. The main barrier to
achieving this is that existing primate neuroimaging data have insufficient
spatial resolution to resolve white matter pathways fully. Here we present a
resource that allows detailed descriptions of white matter structures and
trajectories of fiber pathways in the marmoset brain. The resource includes: (1) 
the highest-resolution diffusion-weighted MRI data available to date, which
reveal white matter features not previously described; (2) a comprehensive
three-dimensional white matter atlas depicting fiber pathways that were either
omitted or misidentified in previous atlases; and (3) comprehensive fiber pathway
maps of cortical connections combining diffusion-weighted MRI tractography and
neuronal tracing data. The resource, which can be downloaded from
marmosetbrainmapping.org, will facilitate studies of brain connectivity and the
development of tractography algorithms in the primate brain.

BACKGROUND: For the diagnosis and treatment of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma
(ATLL) caused by human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) are required
therapeutic modalities urgently. Non-human primate models for ATLL would provide 
a valuable information for clinical studies. We did a pilot study to establish an
ATLL non-human primate model using common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus).
METHODS: We inoculated HTLV-1-producing MT-2 cells into 9-month-old marmosets,
either intraperitoneally or intravenously. We next administrated MT-2 cells into 
13-month-old marmosets under cyclosporine A (CsA) treatment to promote infection.
HTLV-1 infection was determined by measuring HTLV-1 antibody titer in the common 
marmosets.
RESULTS: The HTLV-1 antibody titer increased in the intraperitoneally inoculated 
marmoset with or without CsA treatment, and it kept over five 5 years though
proviral copy number (proviral load, PVL) remained low throughout the study.
CONCLUSION: We obtained HTLV-1 asymptomatic carriers of common marmosets by
inoculating MT-2 cells.

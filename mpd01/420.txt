The recent reemergence of yellow fever virus (YFV) in Brazil has raised serious
concerns due to the rapid dissemination of the virus in the southeastern region. 
To better understand YFV genetic diversity and dynamics during the recent
outbreak in southeastern Brazil, we generated 18 complete and nearly complete
genomes from the peak of the epidemic curve from nonhuman primates (NHPs) and
human infected cases across the Espírito Santo and Rio de Janeiro states. Genomic
sequencing of 18 YFV genomes revealed the estimated timing, source, and likely
routes of yellow fever virus transmission and dispersion during one of the
largest outbreaks ever registered in Brazil. We showed that during the recent
epidemic, YFV was reintroduced from Minas Gerais to the Espírito Santo and Rio de
Janeiro states multiple times between 2016 and 2019. The analysis of data from
portable sequencing could identify the corridor of spread of YFV. These findings 
reinforce the idea that continued genomic surveillance strategies can provide
information on virus genetic diversity and transmission dynamics that might
assist in understanding arbovirus epidemics.IMPORTANCE Arbovirus infections in
Brazil, including yellow fever, dengue, zika, and chikungunya, result in
considerable morbidity and mortality and are pressing public health concerns.
However, our understanding of these outbreaks is hampered by the limited
availability of genomic data. In this study, we investigated the genetic
diversity and spatial distribution of YFV during the current outbreak by
analyzing genomic data from areas in southeastern Brazil not covered by other
previous studies. To gain insights into the routes of YFV introduction and
dispersion, we tracked the virus by sequencing YFV genomes sampled from nonhuman 
primates and infected patients from the southeastern region. Our study provides
an understanding of how YFV initiates transmission in new Brazilian regions and
illustrates that genomics in the field can augment traditional approaches to
infectious disease surveillance and control.

Resting-state functional MRI (RS-fMRI) is widely used to assess how strongly
different brain areas are connected. However, this connection obtained by
RS-fMRI, which is called functional connectivity (FC), simply refers to the
correlation of blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals across time it has yet
to be quantified how accurately FC reflects cellular connectivity (CC). In this
study, we elucidated this relationship using RS-fMRI and quantitative tracer data
in marmosets. In addition, we also elucidated the effects of distance between two
brain regions on the relationship between FC and CC across seed region. To
calculate FC, we used full correlation approach that is considered to reflect not
only direct (monosynaptic connections) but also indirect pathways (polysynaptic
connections). Our main findings are that: (1) overall FC obtained by RS-fMRI was 
highly correlated with tracer-based CC, but correlation coefficients varied
remarkably across seed regions; (2) the strength of FC decreased with increase in
the distance between two regions; (3) correlation coefficients between FC and CC 
after regressing out the effects of the distance between two regions still varied
across seed regions, but some regions have strong correlations. These findings
suggest that although FC reflects the strength of monosynaptic pathways, it is
strongly affected by the distance between regions.

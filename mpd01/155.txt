Curiosity is a fundamental nature of animals for adapting to changing
environments, but its underlying brain circuits and mechanisms remain poorly
understood. One main barrier is that existing studies use rewards to train
animals and motivate their engagement in behavioral tasks. As such, the rewards
become significant confounders in interpreting curiosity. Here, we overcame this 
problem by studying research-naïve and naturally curious marmosets that can
proactively and persistently participate in a visual choice task without external
rewards. When performing the task, the marmosets manifested a strong innate
preference towards acquiring new information, associated with faster behavioral
responses. Longitudinally functional magnetic resonance imaging revealed
behavior-relevant brain states that reflected choice preferences and engaged
several brain regions, including the cerebellum, the hippocampus, and cortical
areas 19DI, 25, and 46D, with the cerebellum being the most prominent. These
results unveil the essential brain circuits and dynamics underlying
curiosity-driven activity.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a New World monkey, serves as a useful 
animal model in clinical and basic neuroscience. The present study recorded scalp
auditory evoked potentials (AEP) in non-sedated common marmoset monkeys (n = 4)
using a noninvasive method similar to that used in humans, and aimed to identify 
nonhuman primate correlates of the human AEP components. A pure tone stimulus was
presented while electroencephalograms were recorded using up to 16 disk
electrodes placed on the scalp and earlobes. Candidate homologues of two
categories of the human AEP, namely, the middle latency responses (MLR; Na, Pa,
Nb, and Pb) and the cortical auditory evoked potentials (CAEP; P1, N1, P2, N2,
and the sustained potential, SP) were identified in the marmoset. These waves
were labeled as CjNa, CjPa, CjNb, CjPb, CjP1, CjN1, CjP2, CjN2, and CjSP, where
Cj stands for Callithrix jacchus. The last MLR component, CjPb, was identical to 
the first CAEP component, CjP1, similar to the relationship between Pb and P1 in 
humans. The peak latencies of the marmoset MLR and CAEP were generally shorter
than in humans, which suggests a shorter integration time in neural processing.
To our knowledge, the present study represents the first scalp recorded MLR and
CAEP in the alert common marmoset. Further use of these recording methods would
enable valid species comparisons of homologous brain indices between humans and
animals.

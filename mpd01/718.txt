Vocalizations are often used by animals to communicate and mediate social
interactions. Animals may benefit from eavesdropping on calls from other species 
to avoid predation and thus increase their chances of survival. Here we use both 
observational and experimental evidence to investigate eavesdropping and how
acoustic signals may mediate interactions between two sympatric and endemic
primate species (common marmosets and blonde capuchin monkeys) in a fragment of
Atlantic Rainforest in Northeastern Brazil. We observed 22 natural vocal
encounters between the study species, but no evident visual or physical contact
over the study period. These two species seem to use the same area throughout the
day, but at different times. We broadcasted alarm and long distance calls to and 
from both species as well as two control stimuli (i.e., forest background noise
and a loud call from an Amazonian primate) in our playback experiments. Common
marmosets showed anti-predator behavior (i.e., vigilance and flight) when exposed
to blonde capuchin calls both naturally and experimentally. However, blonde
capuchin monkeys showed no anti-predator behavior in response to common marmoset 
calls. Blonde capuchins uttered long distance calls and looked in the direction
of the speaker following exposure to their own long distance call, whereas they
fled when exposed to their own alarm calls. Both blonde capuchin monkeys and
common marmosets showed fear behaviors in response to the loud call from a
primate species unknown to them, and showed no apparent response to the forest
background noise. Common marmoset responses to blonde capuchin calls suggests
that the latter is a potential predator. Furthermore, common marmosets appear to 
be eavesdropping on calls from blonde capuchin monkeys to avoid potentially
costly encounters with them.

As with humans, vocal communication is an important social tool for nonhuman
primates. Common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) often produce whistle-like 'phee'
calls when they are visually separated from conspecifics. The neural processes
specific to phee call perception, however, are largely unknown, despite the
possibility that these processes involve social information. Here, we examined
behavioral and whole-brain mapping evidence regarding the detection of individual
conspecific phee calls using an audio playback procedure. Phee calls evoked sound
exploratory responses when the caller changed, indicating that marmosets can
discriminate between caller identities. Positron emission tomography with [18F]
fluorodeoxyglucose revealed that perception of phee calls from a single subject
was associated with activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal, medial prefrontal,
orbitofrontal cortices, and the amygdala. These findings suggest that these
regions are implicated in cognitive and affective processing of salient social
information. However, phee calls from multiple subjects induced brain activation 
in only some of these regions, such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. We
also found distinctive brain deactivation and functional connectivity associated 
with phee call perception depending on the caller change. According to changes in
pupillary size, phee calls from a single subject induced a higher arousal level
compared with those from multiple subjects. These results suggest that marmoset
phee calls convey information about individual identity and affective valence
depending on the consistency or variability of the caller. Based on the flexible 
perception of the call based on individual recognition, humans and marmosets may 
share some neural mechanisms underlying conspecific vocal perception.

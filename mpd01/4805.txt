An involvement of dopamine in higher order choice mechanisms in the monkey.

Ridley RM, Haystead TA, Baker HF.

Low doses of amphetamine induce choice perseveration in an object discrimination 
task under conditions where such perseveration either increases or decreases the 
number of rewards obtained as compared to chance performance. Neither stereotyped
motor actions nor repetitive choice of position contributed to this effect which 
could be blocked by pre-treatment with the neuroleptic haloperidol. These results
demonstrate that higher order choice mechanisms may involve dopamine systems in
the primate.

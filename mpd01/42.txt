In veterinary medicine, blood transfusion is commonly performed on companion
animals. The common marmoset is a small nonhuman primate with increasing
popularity as an animal model in biomedical research. Because of its small whole 
blood volume, the marmoset is at high risk of exsanguination, and blood
transfusion is required to care for life-threatening bleeding. However, few
clinical evaluations exist on transfusions for marmosets. This study performed
whole blood transfusion with cross-matching on nine marmosets and surveyed the
therapeutic effects. Recipients included clinical cases with persistent bleeding,
anemia, and coma, as well as animals subjected to postoperative bleeding
prophylaxis. Donors were selected from healthy marmosets, including littermates. 
Cross-match assay before transfusion were all negative, and recipients showed no 
visible signs of transfusion-related adverse reactions. Whole blood transfusions 
caused hemostasis and successful recovery in bleeding marmosets, including
long-term improvement of anemia cases. Our results indicated that blood
transfusion is effective for marmosets with severe anemia and persistent
hemorrhage from both non-experimental and surgical causes. Furthermore, DNA
sequencing for blood-group classification revealed that all subject marmosets
were type A, suggesting that the risk of blood type mismatch may be low in this
species.

Social cognition is a dynamic process that requires the perception and
integration of a complex set of idiosyncratic features between interacting
conspecifics. Here we present a method for simultaneously measuring the
whole-brain activation of two socially interacting marmoset monkeys using
functional magnetic resonance imaging. MRI hardware (a radiofrequency coil and
peripheral devices) and image-processing pipelines were developed to assess brain
responses to socialization, both on an intra-brain and inter-brain level.
Notably, the brain activation of a marmoset when viewing a second marmoset
in-person versus when viewing a pre-recorded video of the same marmoset-i.e.,
when either capable or incapable of socially interacting with a visible
conspecific-demonstrates increased activation in the face-patch network. This
method enables a wide range of possibilities for potentially studying social
function and dysfunction in a non-human primate model.

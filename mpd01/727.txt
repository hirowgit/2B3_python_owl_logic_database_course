BACKGROUND: To date, reference values for 25-OH-vitamin D, parathyroid hormone
(PTH), and calcium in serum of common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) based on a
large sample size are not available.
METHODS: Serum reference values for these parameters were determined and
correlated with sex, age, season of sampling, and time of long bone epiphyseal
closure in captive-housed marmosets.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The 90% reference range for serum 25-OH-vitamin D is
47.40-370.4 nmol/L, for PTH 2.10-30.51 pmol/L, and for calcium 2.08-2.63 mmol/L. 
Lower levels of vitamin D were measured in fall compared with the other seasons. 
Levels of PTH were higher in males than in females, and calcium levels were lower
in younger animals compared with older marmosets. No other effects of age, sex,
season, or timing of growth plate closure were found.

BACKGROUND: Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) of mammals lose the ability to
regenerate injured axons during postnatal maturation, but little is known about
the underlying molecular mechanisms.
OBJECTIVE: It remains of particular importance to understand the mechanisms of
axonal regeneration to develop new therapeutic approaches for nerve injuries.
METHODS: Retinas from newborn to adult monkeys (Callithrix jacchus)1 were
obtained immediately after death and cultured in vitro. Growths of axons were
monitored using microscopy and time-lapse video cinematography.
Immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, qRT-PCR, and genomics were performed to
characterize molecules associated with axonal regeneration and growth. A genomic 
screen was performed by using retinal explants versus native and non-regenerative
explants obtained from eye cadavers on the day of birth, and hybridizing the mRNA
with cross-reacting cDNA on conventional human microarrays. Followed the genomic 
screen, siRNA experiments were conducted to identify the functional involvement
of identified candidates.
RESULTS: Neuron-specific human ribonucleoprotein N (snRPN) was found to be a
potential regulator of impaired axonal regeneration during neuronal maturation in
these animals. In particular, up-regulation of snRPN was observed during retinal 
maturation, coinciding with a decline in regenerative ability. Axon regeneration 
was reactivated in snRPN-knockout retinal ex vivo explants of adult monkey.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that coordinated snRPN-driven activities within
the neuron-specific ribonucleoprotein complex regulate the regenerative ability
of RGCs in primates, thereby highlighting a potential new role for snRPN within
neurons and the possibility of novel postinjury therapies.

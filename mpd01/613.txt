The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-related molecule, MR1,
presents vitamin B metabolites from bacteria and yeast to mucosal-associated
invariant T (MAIT) cells. Despite the evolutionary conservation of MR1, we do not
know whether different allele variants of MR1 exist within the nonhuman primate
(NHP) populations that are commonly used for biomedical research. In this study, 
we identified 21 distinct MR1 nucleotide sequences representing 32 different
alleles across five different NHP populations. The majority of the alleles
conferring amino acid changes (allele variants) were found in or near the alpha-1
domain of the mature MR1 protein. We expressed four of the most commonly observed
MR1 allele variants in 293T cells, and we found that each variant could present
bacterial metabolites on the cell surface. We successfully induced cytokine
production in macaque MAIT cells stimulated with 293T cells expressing the four
most common MR1 allele variants, demonstrating the usefulness of these cell lines
to study MAIT cell activity. Our data suggests that MR1 is not monomorphic, but
that there are multiple MR1 alleles in NHPs. The materials we describe here will 
be valuable for characterizing differences in MR1 antigen presentation and MAIT
cell function in NHPs.

BACKGROUND: Chronic recordings with multi-electrode arrays are widely used to
study neural networks underlying complex primate behaviors. Most of these systems
are designed for studying neural activity in the cortical hemispheres resulting
in a lack of devices being capable of simultaneously recording from ensembles of 
neurons in deep brainstem structures. However, to fully understand complex
behavior, it is fundamental to also decipher the intrinsic mechanisms of the
underlying motor pattern generating circuits in the brainstem.
NEW METHOD: We report a light-weight system that simultaneously measures
single-unit activity from a large number of recording sites in the brainstem of
marmoset monkeys. It includes a base chamber fixed to the animal's skull and a
removable upper chamber that can be semi-chronically mounted to the base chamber 
to flexibly position an embedded micro-drive containing a 32-channel laminar
probe to record from various positions within the brainstem for several weeks.
RESULTS: The current system is capable of simultaneously recording stable
single-unit activity from a large number of recording sites in the brainstem of
vocalizing marmoset monkeys.
COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: To the best of our knowledge, chronic systems
to record from deep brainstem structures with multi-site laminar probes in awake,
behaving monkeys do not yet exist.
CONCLUSIONS: The semi-chronic implantation of laminar electrodes into the
brainstem of behaving marmoset monkeys opens new research possibilities in fully 
understanding the neural mechanisms underlying complex behaviors in marmoset
monkeys.

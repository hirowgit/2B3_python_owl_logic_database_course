BACKGROUND: Increased firing across glutamatergic synapses may contribute to both
the motor dysfunction and L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia seen in Parkinson's disease. 
Given their ability to reduce glutamate release, activation of group III
metabotropic glutamate receptors such as metabotropic glutamate receptor 4 may
prove effective against both motor dysfunction and dyskinesia in Parkinson's
disease.
OBJECTIVE: We hypothesised that activation of metabotropic glutamate receptor 4
by an orthosteric agonist
((2S)-2-amino-4-(hydroxy(hydroxy(4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-5-nitrophenyl)methyl)phospho
ryl)butanoic acid, LSP1-2111) would produce antiparkinsonian activity and reduce 
expression of dyskinesia in a 1-methyl-4-phenyl,1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine
(MPTP)-treated marmoset model of Parkinson's disease.
METHODS: Common marmosets were previously treated with MPTP and pre-primed with
L-DOPA for up to 28 days to express dyskinesia. LSP1-2111 (1, 3, or 6 mg/kg s.c.)
or vehicle (0.9% saline s.c.) were administered immediately prior to L-DOPA
(8 mg/kg + benserazide (10 mg/kg) p.o.) or vehicle (10% sucrose p.o.). Locomotor 
activity was measured in automated test cages and animals were scored for
dyskinesia and disability.
RESULTS: As expected, L-DOPA reversed motor disability and induced moderate
dyskinesia. By contrast, LSP1-2111 alone significantly reduced the motor
disability without any accompanying expression of dyskinesia. When administered
in combination with L-DOPA, LSP1-2111 did not significantly reduce the severity
of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia.
CONCLUSION: Systemic administration of LSP1-2111 reduces motor disability without
causing dyskinesia in MPTP-treated marmosets, supporting a role for metabotropic 
glutamate receptor 4 orthosteric agonists as promising monotherapy for PD.
Conversely, this study found no evidence to support their use as antidyskinetic
agents within the dose range tested.

Ischemic stroke mostly affects the primary motor cortex and descending motor
fibres, with consequent motor impairment. Pre-clinical models of stroke with
reproducible and long-lasting sensorimotor deficits in higher-order animals are
lacking. We describe a new method to induce focal brain damage targeting the
motor cortex to study damage to the descending motor tracts in the non-human
primate. Stereotaxic injection of malonate into the primary motor cortex produced
a focal lesion in middle-aged marmosets (Callithrix jacchus). Assessment of
sensorimotor function using a neurological scale and testing of forelimb
dexterity and strength lasted a minimum of 12 weeks. Lesion evolution was
followed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 24 h, 1 week, 4 and 12 weeks
post-injury and before sacrifice for immunohistochemistry. Our model produced
consistent lesions of the motor cortex, subcortical white matter and caudate
nucleus. All animals displayed partial spontaneous recovery with long lasting
motor deficits of force (54% loss) and dexterity (≈ 70% loss). Clearly visible T2
hypointensity in the white matter was observed with MRI and corresponded to areas
of chronic gliosis in the internal capsule and lenticular fasciculus. We describe
a straightforward procedure to reproducibly injure the motor cortex in the
marmoset monkey, causing long-lasting motor deficits. The MRI signature reflects 
Wallerian degeneration and remote injury of corticospinal and corticopontine
tracts, as well as subcortical motor loops. Our model may be suitable for the
testing of therapies for post-stroke recovery, particularly in the chronic phase.

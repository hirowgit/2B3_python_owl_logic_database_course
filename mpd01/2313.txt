Polyomaviruses are a family of small nonenveloped DNA viruses that infect birds
and mammals. At least 7 nonhuman primate polyomaviruses that occur in macaques,
African green monkeys, marmosets baboons, and chimpanzees have been described, as
well as 4 polyomaviruses that occur in humans. Simian virus 40 (SV40), which
infects macaques, was the first nonhuman primate polyomavirus identified as a
contaminant of early polio vaccines. Primate polyomaviruses cause inapparent
primary infections but persist in the host and can cause severe disease in
situations of immunocompromise. This review describes the primate polyomaviruses,
and the diseases associated with the viruses of macaques. In macaques, the
greatest current concerns are the potential confounding of study results by
polyomavirus infections and the zoonotic potential of SV40.

transformation.

Primary cultures of cells tend to have a limited life span, which in turn limits 
the availability of a consistent population of cells to study. In this unit,
Epstein-Barr virus produced by a marmoset cell line is used to transform B cells 
into a continuously growing cell line that produces no virus. These cell lines
can be used as a constant source of cells for further study.

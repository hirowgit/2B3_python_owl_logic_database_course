Neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) are distinguished by the
neurotransmitter types they release, their synaptic connections, morphology, and 
genetic profiles. To fully understand how the CNS works, it is critical to
identify all neuronal classes and reveal their synaptic connections. The retina
has been extensively used to study neuronal development and circuit formation.
Here, we describe a previously unidentified interneuron in mammalian retina. This
interneuron shares some morphological, physiological, and molecular features with
retinal bipolar cells, such as receiving input from photoreceptors and relaying
visual signals to retinal ganglion cells. It also shares some features with
amacrine cells (ACs), particularly Aii-ACs, such as their neurite morphology in
the inner plexiform layer, the expression of some AC-specific markers, and
possibly the release of the inhibitory neurotransmitter glycine. Thus, we unveil 
an uncommon interneuron, which may play an atypical role in vision.

Longitudinal studies are essential to understand healthy and pathological
neurocognitive aging such as Alzheimer's Disease, but longitudinal designs are
rare in both humans and non-human primate models of aging because of the
difficulty of tracking cognitive change in long-lived primates. Common marmosets 
(Callithrix jacchus) are uniquely suited for aging studies due to their naturally
short lifespan (10-12 years), sophisticated cognitive and social abilities and
Alzheimer Disease-like neuropathology. We report the first longitudinal study of 
cognitive aging in marmosets (N = 28) as they transitioned from middle- (∼5
years) to old age (∼9 years). We characterized aging trajectories using reversal 
learning with different stimuli each year. Marmosets initially improved on
cognitive performance due to practice, but worsened in the final year, suggesting
the onset of age-related decline. Cognitive impairment emerged earlier in females
than males and was more prominent for discrimination than for reversal learning. 
Sex differences in cognitive aging could not be explained by differences in
motivation or motor abilities, which improved or remained stable across aging.
Likewise, males and females did not differ in aging trajectories of overall
behavior or reactivity to a social stressor, with the exception of a progressive 
decline in the initiation of social behavior in females. Patterns of cognitive
aging were highly variable across marmosets of both sexes, suggesting the
potential for pathological aging for some individuals. Future work will link
individual cognitive trajectories to neuropathology in order to better understand
the relationships between neuropathologic burden and vulnerability to age-related
cognitive decline in each sex.

BACKGROUND: The brain of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is becoming a
popular non-human primate model in neuroscience research. Because its brain fiber
connectivity is still poorly understood, it is necessary to collect and present
connection and trajectory data using tracers to establish a marmoset brain
connectivity database.
NEW METHOD: To visualize projections and trajectories of axons, brain section
images were reconstructed in 3D by registering them to the corresponding
block-face brain images taken during brain sectioning. During preprocessing,
autofluorescence of the tissue was reduced by applying independent component
analysis to a set of fluorescent images taken using different filters.
RESULTS: The method was applied to a marmoset dataset after a tracer had been
injected into an auditory belt area to fluorescently label axonal projections.
Cortical and subcortical connections were clearly reconstructed in 3D. The
registration error was estimated to be smaller than 200 μm. Evaluation tests on
ICA-based autofluorescence reduction showed a significant improvement in signal
and background separation.
COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: Regarding the 3D reconstruction error, the
present study shows an accuracy comparable to previous studies using MRI and
block-face images. Compared to serial section two-photon tomography, an advantage
of the proposed method is that it can be combined with standard histological
techniques. The images of differently processed brain sections can be integrated 
into the original ex vivo brain shape.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed method allows creating 3D axonal projection maps
overlaid with brain area annotations based on the histological staining results
of the same animal.

BACKGROUND: The common marmoset has been used as an experimental animal for
various purposes. Because its average weight ranges from 250 to 500 g, weight
loss quickly becomes critical for sick animals. Therefore, effective and
non-stressful treatment for chronic diseases, including diarrhoea, is essential.
CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case in which faecal microbiota transplantation
(FMT) led to immediate recovery from chronic and recurrent diarrhoea caused by
Clostridium difficile infection. A male common marmoset experienced chronic
diarrhoea after antibiotic treatments. The animal experienced severe weight loss,
and a faecal sample was confirmed to be C. difficile-positive but was negative
for protozoa. Metronidazole was partially effective at the first administration
but not after the recurrence of the clinical signs. Then, oral FMT was
administered to the subject by feeding fresh faeces from healthy individuals
mixed with the marmoset's usual food. We monitored the faeces by categorization
into four groups: normal, loose, diarrhoea, and watery. After the first day of
FMT treatment, the marmoset underwent a remarkable recovery from diarrhoea, and
after the fourth day of treatment, a test for C. difficile was negative. The
clinical signs did not recur. The marmoset recovered from sinusitis and bilateral
dacryocystitis, which also did not recur, as a by-product of the improvement in
its general health caused by the cessation of diarrhoea after the FMT.
CONCLUSION: This is the first reported case of successful treatment of a marmoset
using oral FMT. As seen in human patients, FMT was effective for the treatment of
recurrent C. difficile infection in a captive marmoset.

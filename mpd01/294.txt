Hair cortisol concentration (HCC) provides a long-term retrospective measure of
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity, and is increasingly used to assess 
the life history, health and ecology of wild mammals. Given that sex, age, season
and pregnancy influence HCC, and that it may indicate ongoing stress, we examined
HCC in common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) naturally inhabiting a hot and dry
semi-desert like habitat, Caatinga, in northeastern Brazil. We trapped, measured,
weighed, marked and collected shaved hair from the back of the neck of 61 wild
marmosets during the wet and dry seasons. Using enzyme immunoassay, we found that
HCC was higher in the dry season compared with the wet season among all age/sex
classes. Females had significantly higher HCC than males, juveniles had higher
HCC than adults, and reproductively active adult females and non-pregnant/non
lactating adult females did not differ in HCC. There were no interaction effects 
of sex, age, group, or season on HCC. The magnitude of the effect of this
extremely hot and dry environment (average yearly rainfall was only 271 mm) on
HCC in common marmosets is difficult to ascertain as these animals are also
experiencing a variety of other stressors. However, the elevated HCC seen in
common marmosets during the 5-8 month dry season, suggests these primates face an
extended period of heat, water and possibly nutritional stress, which appears to 
result in a high rate of juvenile mortality.

Monoamine oxidase (MAO) type B (MAO-B) inhibition was shown to confer
anti-parkinsonian benefit as monotherapy and adjunct to
L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) in clinical trials. Here, we explore the
anti-parkinsonian effect of MAO type A (MAO-A) inhibition as monotherapy, as the 
enzyme MAO-A is also encountered within the primate and human basal ganglia,
where it metabolises dopamine, albeit to a lesser extent than MAO-B. In six
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-lesioned marmosets, we
assessed the anti-parkinsonian effect of the reversible MAO-A inhibitor
moclobemide (0.1 and 1 mg/kg) as monotherapy and compared it to that of L-DOPA
and vehicle treatments. Moclobemide significantly reversed parkinsonism (by 39%, 
P < 0.01), while eliciting only mild dyskinesia and psychosis-like behaviours
(PLBs). In contrast, L-DOPA anti-parkinsonian effect was accompanied by marked
dyskinesia and PLBs. MAO-A inhibition with moclobemide may provide
anti-parkinsonian benefit when administered without L-DOPA and might perhaps be
considered as monotherapy for the treatment of Parkinson's disease in the early
stages of the condition.

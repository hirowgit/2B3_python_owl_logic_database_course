INTRODUCTION: In vivo models have been required to demonstrate relative cardiac
safety, but model sensitivity has not been systematically investigated.
Cross-species and human translation of repolarization delay, assessed as QT/QTc
prolongation, has not been compared employing common methodologies across
multiple species and sites. Therefore, the accurate translation of repolarization
results within and between preclinical species, and to man, remains problematic.
METHODS: Six pharmaceutical companies entered into an informal consortium
designed to collect high-resolution telemetered data in multiple species (dog;
n=34, cynomolgus; n=37, minipig; n=12, marmoset; n=14, guinea pig; n=5, and man; 
n=57). All animals received vehicle and varying doses of moxifloxacin (3-100
mg/kg, p.o.) with telemetered ECGs (≥500 Hz) obtained for 20-24h post-dose.
Individual probabilistic QT-RR relationships were derived for each subject. The
rate-correction efficacies of the individual (QTca) and generic correction
formulae (Bazett, Fridericia, and Van de Water) were objectively assessed as the 
mean squared slopes of the QTc-RR relationships. Normalized moxifloxacin QTca
responses (Veh Δ%/μM) were derived for 1h centered on the moxifloxacin Tmax.
RESULTS: All QT-RR ranges demonstrated probabilistic uncertainty; slopes varied
distinctly by species where dog and human exhibited the lowest QT
rate-dependence, which was much steeper in the cynomolgus and guinea pig.
Incorporating probabilistic uncertainty, the normalized QTca-moxifloxacin
responses were similarly conserved across all species, including man.
DISCUSSION: The current results provide the first unambiguous evidence that all
preclinical in vivo repolarization assays, when accurately modeled and evaluated,
yield results that are consistent with the conservation of moxifloxacin-induced
QT prolongation across all common preclinical species. Furthermore, these
outcomes are directly transferable across all species including man. The
consortium results indicate that the implementation of standardized QTc data
presentation, QTc reference cycle lengths, and rate-correction coefficients can
markedly improve the concordance of preclinical and clinical outcomes in most
preclinical species.

Dexamethasone (Dex) inhibits the growth of diverse types of cancer cells and is
utilized clinically for the therapy of hematological malignancies. In this study,
we investigated the molecular mechanisms of Dex action in the apoptosis of
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed B cells. We showed that Dex inhibited the
proliferation of EBV-transformed B cells and induced apoptosis by activating
caspase-9, -3 and -8. While activation of caspase-9 was triggered as early as 2 h
after Dex treatment, cleavage of caspase-8 was deferred and was found 8 h after
the exposure. Dex-dependent activation of caspase-8 was blocked by the specific
caspase-9 inhibitor, z-LEHD-fmk. Moreover, Dex significantly increased the
expression of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP)‑associated factor 1 (XAF1)
and induced the translocation of XAF1 into the cytosol. Cytosolic XAF1 with Puma 
induced the translocation of Bax into mitochondria. Dex led to up-regulation of
reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 after 
the exposure. We speculated that ROS generation might be the first event of
Dex-induced apoptosis because ROS inhibitor NAC abrogated ROS production and
ERK1/2 activation, but PD98059 did not block ROS production. NAC and PD98059 also
suppressed the translocation of XAF1, Puma and Bax into mitochondria. These
results demonstrated that Dex-mediated activation of caspase-9 via ROS generation
and ERK1/2 pathway activation resulted in the activation of caspase-8 and the
increment of XAF1, thereby induced apoptosis of EBV-transformed B cells. These
findings suggest that Dex constitutes a probable therapy for EBV-associated
hematological malignancies.

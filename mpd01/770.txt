The prevailing model of the primate auditory cortex proposes a core-belt-parabelt
structure. The model proposes three auditory areas in the lateral belt region;
however, it may contain more, as this region has been mapped only at a limited
spatial resolution. To explore this possibility, we examined the auditory areas
in the lateral belt region of the marmoset using a high-resolution optical
imaging technique. Based on responses to pure tones, we identified multiple areas
in the superior temporal gyrus. The three areas in the core region, the primary
area (A1), the rostral area (R), and the rostrotemporal area, were readily
identified from their frequency gradients and positions immediately ventral to
the lateral sulcus. Three belt areas were identified with frequency gradients and
relative positions to A1 and R that were in agreement with previous studies: the 
caudolateral area, the middle lateral area, and the anterolateral area (AL).
Situated between R and AL, however, we identified two additional areas. The first
was located caudoventral to R with a frequency gradient in the ventrocaudal
direction, which we named the medial anterolateral (MAL) area. The second was a
small area with no obvious tonotopy (NT), positioned between the MAL and AL
areas. Both the MAL and NT areas responded to a wide range of frequencies (at
least 2-24 kHz). Our results suggest that the belt region caudoventral to R is
more complex than previously proposed, and we thus call for a refinement of the
current primate auditory cortex model.

Experimental intranasal infection of marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) with calpox
virus results in fatal disease. Route and dose used for viral inoculation of the 
test animals mimics the natural transmission of smallpox, thus representing a
suitable model to study pathogenesis and to evaluate new vaccines against
orthopoxvirus infection. However, the pathogenic mechanisms leading to death are 
still unclear. Therefore, our study aimed at investigating the kinetics of
pathological alterations to clarify the pathogenesis in calpox virus infection.
Following intranasal inoculation with two different viral doses, common marmosets
were sacrificed on days 3, 5, 7, 10 and 12 post inoculation. Collected tissue was
screened using histopathology, immunohistochemistry, transmission electron
microscopy, and virological assays. Our data suggest that primary replication
took place in nasal and bronchial epithelia followed by secondary replication in 
submandibular lymph nodes and spleen. Parallel to viremia at day 7, virus was
detectable in many organs, mainly located in epithelial cells and macrophages, as
well as in endothelial cells. Based on the onset of clinical signs, the
histological and ultrastructural lesions and the immunohistochemical distribution
pattern of the virus, the incubation period was defined to last 11 days, which
resembles human smallpox. In conclusion, the data indicate that the calpox model 
is highly suitable for studying orthopoxvirus-induced disease.

The visual brain is composed of interconnected subcortical and cortical
structures that receive and process image information originating in the retina. 
The visual system of nonhuman primates, in particular macaques, has been studied 
in great detail in order to elucidate principles of human sensation and
perception. The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a small New World monkey 
of growing interest as a primate model for neuroscience. Marmosets have
advantages over macaques because of their small size, lissencephalic cortex, and 
growing potential for viral and genetic manipulations. Previous anatomical
studies and electrophysiological recordings in anesthetized marmosets have shown 
that this species' cortical visual hierarchy closely resembles that of other
primates, including humans. Until now, however, there have been no attempts to
systematically study visual responses throughout the marmoset brain using fMRI.
Here we show that awake marmosets readily learn to carry out a simple visual task
inside the bore of an MRI scanner during functional mapping experiments.
Functional scanning at 500 Î¼m in-plane resolution in a 30 cm horizontal bore at 7
T revealed robust positive blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI
responses to visual stimuli throughout visual cortex and associated subcortical
areas. Nonvisual sensory areas showed negative contrasts to visual stimuli
compared to the fixation dot only baseline. Structured images of objects and
faces led to stronger responses than scrambled control images at stages beyond
early visual cortex. Our study establishes fMRI mapping of visual responses in
awake, behaving marmosets as a straightforward and valuable tool for assessing
the functional organization of the primate brain at high resolution.

Although current nonhuman primate models of monkeypox and smallpox diseases
provide some insight into disease pathogenesis, they require a high titer
inoculum, use an unnatural route of infection, and/or do not accurately represent
the entire disease course. This is a concern when developing smallpox and/or
monkeypox countermeasures or trying to understand host pathogen relationships. In
our studies, we altered half of the test system by using a New World nonhuman
primate host, the common marmoset. Based on dose finding studies, we found that
marmosets are susceptible to monkeypox virus infection, produce a high viremia,
and have pathological features consistent with smallpox and monkeypox in humans. 
The low dose (48 plaque forming units) required to elicit a uniformly lethal
disease and the extended incubation (preclinical signs) are unique features among
nonhuman primate models utilizing monkeypox virus. The uniform lethality,
hemorrhagic rash, high viremia, decrease in platelets, pathology, and abbreviated
acute phase are reflective of early-type hemorrhagic smallpox.

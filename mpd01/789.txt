Common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) have been recognized as a useful small
non-human primate model in preclinical testing for drug development. In this
study, a cDNA of novel ATP-dependent efflux transporter ABCB1 was cloned from
marmoset liver tissue. Marmoset ABCB1 cDNA encodes a protein of 1279 amino acid
residues (MW = 141.4 kDa) containing characteristic regions of an ATP-binding
cassette (ABC) protein, two hydrophobic transmembrane regions and two cytoplasmic
nucleotide-binding regions, similar to human ABCB1. The deduced amino acid
sequences were more highly identical (95%) to those of human ABCB1 compared with 
non-primate species such as dogs, pigs and rodents (79-90%). A close evolutionary
relationship of ABCB1 among marmosets, cynomolgus and rhesus monkeys and humans
was evident from a phylogenetic analysis using ABCB1 amino acid sequences from
primates, dogs, pigs and rodents. Tissue distribution analyses by quantitative
reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction indicated that marmoset ABCB1
mRNA was most abundant in kidneys, followed by small intestines and livers,
similar to human ABCB1, and marmoset ABCB1 proteins in these tissues were also
detected by immunoblotting. These results indicated that the primary structure
and tissue distribution of ABCB1 in marmosets were similar to those of humans,
suggesting similar molecular characteristics of ABCB1 between marmosets and
humans.

The eyes absent (EYA)-like genes are essential for the formation of sensory
organs among fly (Drosophila melanogaster) and mammals. EYA4, one of the
vertebrate genes of Eya family, is reported to be causative for late-onset
mid-frequency sensorineural hearing loss in humans, while Eya4-deficient mice
exhibited congenital profound deafness and otitis media with effusion due to the 
eustachian tube dysmorphology. Because of the species difference in the
phenotype, the pathophysiology of EYA4 in the human cochlea has yet to be
elucidated. Here, we examine the expression pattern of EYA4 in the cochlea of
common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a non-human primate. The results indicated 
a distinct expression pattern of EYA4 in the adult marmoset cochleae, especially 
strong in all supporting cells, while in mouse their expressions were diminished.
Interestingly, EYA4 expression in the hair cells, supporting cells and neurons
was co-localized with sine oculis homeobox-SIX1, a transcription factor essential
for the transcriptional activity of EYA4. The results revealed inter-species
differences in the expression pattern of EYA4 gene in supporting cells between
primates and rodents. The results also indicated a fundamental role of EYA4 in
the primate auditory cells. Experiments with primate models such as marmosets or 
with human cochlear cells may provide cues about the unknown pathogenesis of
EYA4-related hearing loss.

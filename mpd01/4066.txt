Pathogenicity of the lapinized Nakamura-III (L) strain of rinderpest virus (RPV) 
was examined in four strains of rabbits consisting of two inbred strains (NW-NIBS
and DUY-NIBS) and two outbred strains maintained in closed colony (NW-NIBS and
JW-NIBS) using a marmoset lymphoblastoid cell line, B95a cell-passaged virus and 
tissue homogenates of virus-infected rabbits. The cell culture virus was found to
maintain virulence for rabbits of both closed colony and inbred NW-NIBS strain
similar to the homogenate virus. Among the strains investigated, inbred NW-NIBS
strain showed the highest susceptibility to RPV. Thus experimental model in an
inbred rabbit using cell culture virus became useful.

Canine distemper virus (CDV) was readily isolated at high rate with marked
cytopathic effect (CPE) in B95a cells, a marmoset lymphoid cell line, from the
peripheral blood leukocytes, cerebrospinal fluid cells and brain of dogs.
Difference in type of CPE, i.e. syncytium type and round-cell one, among the
virus isolates indicate the presence of heterogeneity of virus populations in
prevalent CDV. Thus, this cell system is expected to be useful for ecological
studies on CDV in the field.

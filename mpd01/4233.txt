Passive immunization of adult male hamsters for 12 weeks against peptide
(As-PIP), a sperm coating antigen, resulted in selective elevation of the blood
levels of FSH, impairment of spermatogenesis, and complete infertility when males
were mated with normal cycling females. Passive immunization of male marmosets
with As-PIP for 8 weeks was also effective and was reversible, without causing
any obvious change in mating behaviour. These preliminary studies in hamsters and
marmosets indicate that antibodies to a prostatic 'inhibin' peptide represent a
promising new approach to male contraception.

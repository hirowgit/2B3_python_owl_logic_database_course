An audience can have a profound effect on the dynamics of communicative
interactions. As a result, non-human primates often adjust their social
decision-making strategies depending on the audience composition at a given time.
Here we sought to test how the unique vocal behaviour of multiple audience
members affected decisions to communicate. To address this issue, we developed a 
novel experimental paradigm in which common marmosets directly interacted with
multiple 'virtual monkeys' (VMs), each of whom represented an individual marmoset
with distinct vocal behaviour. This active social signalling paradigm provided
subjects an opportunity to interact with and learn about the behaviour of each VM
in the network and apply this knowledge in subsequent communicative decisions. We
found that subjects' propensity to interact with particular VMs was determined by
the behaviour of each VM in the audience and suggests that marmoset social
decision-making strategies are highly adaptive to nuances of the immediate
communication network.

Harmonicity is a fundamental element of music, speech, and animal vocalizations. 
How the auditory system extracts harmonic structures embedded in complex sounds
and uses them to form a coherent unitary entity is not fully understood. Despite 
the prevalence of sounds rich in harmonic structures in our everyday hearing
environment, it has remained largely unknown what neural mechanisms are used by
the primate auditory cortex to extract these biologically important acoustic
structures. In this study, we discovered a unique class of harmonic template
neurons in the core region of auditory cortex of a highly vocal New World
primate, the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), across the entire hearing
frequency range. Marmosets have a rich vocal repertoire and a similar hearing
range to that of humans. Responses of these neurons show nonlinear facilitation
to harmonic complex sounds over inharmonic sounds, selectivity for particular
harmonic structures beyond two-tone combinations, and sensitivity to harmonic
number and spectral regularity. Our findings suggest that the harmonic template
neurons in auditory cortex may play an important role in processing sounds with
harmonic structures, such as animal vocalizations, human speech, and music.

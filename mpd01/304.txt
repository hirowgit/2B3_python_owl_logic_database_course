Associations between altered DNA methylation of the serotonin transporter
(5-HTT)-encoding gene SLC6A4 and early life adversity, mood and anxiety
disorders, and amygdala reactivity have been reported. However, few studies have 
examined epigenetic alterations of SLC6A4 in schizophrenia (SZ). We examined CpG 
sites of SLC6A4, whose DNA methylation levels have been reported to be altered in
bipolar disorder, using 3 independent cohorts of patients with SZ and age-matched
controls. We found significant hypermethylation of a CpG site in SLC6A4 in male
patients with SZ in all 3 cohorts. We showed that chronic administration of
risperidone did not affect the DNA methylation status at this CpG site using
common marmosets, and that in vitro DNA methylation at this CpG site diminished
the promoter activity of SLC6A4. We then genotyped the 5-HTT-linked polymorphic
region (5-HTTLPR) and investigated the relationship among 5-HTTLPR, DNA
methylation, and amygdala volume using brain imaging data. We found that patients
harboring low-activity 5-HTTLPR alleles showed hypermethylation and they showed a
negative correlation between DNA methylation levels and left amygdala volumes.
These results suggest that hypermethylation of the CpG site in SLC6A4 is involved
in the pathophysiology of SZ, especially in male patients harboring low-activity 
5-HTTLPR alleles.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a New World primate that is becoming 
increasingly popular as a preclinical model. To assess functional connectivity
(FC) across the marmoset brain, resting-state functional MRI (RS-fMRI) is often
performed under isoflurane anesthesia to avoid the effects of motion,
physiological stress, and training requirements. In marmosets, however, it
remains unclear how isoflurane anesthesia affects patterns of FC. Here, we
investigated the effects of isoflurane on FC when delivered with either medical
air or 100% pure oxygen, two canonical methods of inhalant isoflurane anesthesia 
delivery. The results demonstrated that when delivered with either medical air or
100% oxygen, isoflurane globally decreased FC across resting-state networks that 
were identified in awake marmosets. Generally, although isoflurane globally
decreased FC in resting-state networks, the spatial structure of the networks was
preserved. Outside of the context of RS networks, we indexed pair-wise functional
connectivity between regions across the brain and found that isoflurane
substantially altered interhemispheric and thalamic FC. Taken together, these
findings indicate that RS-fMRI under isoflurane anesthesia is useful to evaluate 
the global structure of functional networks, but may obfuscate important nodes of
some network components when compared to data acquired in fully awake marmosets.

With increasing attention on the developmental causes of neuropsychiatric
disorders, appropriate animal models are crucial to identifying causes and
assessing potential interventions. The common marmoset is an ideal model as it
has sophisticated social/emotional behavior, reaching adulthood within 2 years of
birth. Magnetic resonance imaging was used in an accelerated longitudinal cohort 
(n = 41; aged 3-27 months; scanned 2-7 times over 2 years). Splines were used to 
model nonlinear trajectories of grey matter volume development in 53 cortical
areas and 16 subcortical nuclei. Generally, volumes increased before puberty,
peaked, and declined into adulthood. We identified 3 milestones of grey matter
development: I) age at peak volume; II) age at onset of volume decline; and III) 
age at maximum rate of volume decline. These milestones differentiated growth
trajectories of primary sensory/motor cortical areas from those of association
cortex but also revealed distinct trajectories between association cortices.
Cluster analysis of trajectories showed that prefrontal cortex was the most
heterogenous of association regions, comprising areas with distinct milestones
and developmental trajectories. These results highlight the potential of
high-field structural MRI to define the dynamics of primate brain development and
importantly to identify when specific prefrontal circuits may be most vulnerable 
to environmental impact.

Common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) demonstrate variations in reproductive
output, not only in terms of total reproductive output during a lifetime but also
in litter size per parturition. The present study explores factors, such as
parents' litter size, parturition number, maternal body weight at conception and 
maternal age, which may account for this variation. A retrospective analysis of
clinical records of a captive breeding colony was conducted over a 9-year period 
yielding reproductive summaries of 26 dams and 22 sires producing a total of 115 
litters. Dams born from litters of  ≤2 (N = 20) more often produced litters of
≤2, whereas dams born from litters of >2 (N = 6) more often produced litters of
>2 (p < 0.05). The dams' maternal body weight at the time of conception had also 
a significant effect on subsequent litter size. In addition, the chance of
triplets was higher after the second parturition. Maternal age, interbirth
interval, and season of birth had no effect on litter size. Factors relating to
the sire had a negligible effect on the size of the litter. Multivariate
statistical modeling revealed that the dams' original litter size, maternal
bodyweight at conception and parturition number are determining factors for the
number of babies per litter. This study identified factors determining marmoset
litter size, some of which (maternal litter size) are novel to this study and
were not reported previously. Further exploration of the potential role of
maternal litter size as a determinant of the litter sizes produced by marmoset
breeders is warranted.

BACKGROUND: Protocadherin-11 is a cell adhesion molecule of the cadherin
superfamily. Since, only in humans, its paralog is found on the Y chromosome, it 
is expected that protocadherin-11X/Y plays some role in human brain evolution or 
sex differences. Recently, a genetic mutation of protocadherin-11X/Y was reported
to be associated with a language development disorder. Here, we compared the
expression of protocadherin-11 X-linked in developing postnatal brains of mouse
(rodent) and common marmoset (non-human primate) to explore its possible
involvement in mammalian brain evolution. We also investigated its expression in 
the Bengalese finch (songbird) to explore a possible function in animal
vocalization and human language faculties.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Protocadherin-11 X-linked was strongly expressed 
in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, amygdala and brainstem. Comparative analysis
between mice and marmosets revealed that in certain areas of marmoset brain, the 
expression was clearly enriched. In Bengalese finches, protocadherin-11 X-linked 
was expressed not only in nuclei of regions of the vocal production pathway and
the tracheosyringeal hypoglossal nucleus, but also in areas homologous to the
mammalian amygdala and hippocampus. In both marmosets and Bengalese finches, its 
expression in pallial vocal control areas was developmentally regulated, and no
clear expression was seen in the dorsal striatum, indicating a similarity between
songbirds and non-human primates.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results suggest that the enriched expression of
protocadherin-11 X-linked is involved in primate brain evolution and that some
similarity exists between songbirds and primates regarding the neural basis for
vocalization.

OBJECTIVE: The common marmoset as a model of early obesity was assessed. The
hypotheses that juvenile marmosets with excess adipose tissue will display higher
fasting glucose, decreased insulin sensitivity, and decreased ability to clear
glucose from the blood stream were tested.
DESIGN AND METHODS: Normal and obese (body fat > 14%) common marmoset infants (N 
= 39) were followed up from birth until 1 year. Body fat was measured by
quantitative magnetic resonance. Circulating glucose was measured by glucometer
and insulin, adiponectin, and leptin by commercial assays. The quantitative
insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI; a measure of insulin sensitivity) was
calculated for subjects with fasting glucose and insulin measures. Oral glucose
tolerance tests (OGTTs) were conducted at 12 months on 35 subjects.
RESULTS: At 6 months, obese subjects already had significantly lower insulin
sensitivity (mean QUICKI = 0.378 ± 0.029 vs. 0.525 ± 0.019, N = 11, P = 0.003).
By 12 months, obese subjects also had higher fasting glucose (129.3 ± 9.1 mg/dL
vs. 106.1 ± 6.5 mg/dL, P = 0.042), and circulating adiponectin tended to be lower
(P = 0.057). Leptin was associated with percent body fat; however, birth weight
also influenced circulating leptin. The OGTT results demonstrated that obese
animals had a decreased ability to clear glucose.
CONCLUSIONS: Early-onset obesity in marmosets results in impaired glucose
homeostasis by 1 year.

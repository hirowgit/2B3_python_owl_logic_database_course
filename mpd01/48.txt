BACKGROUND: Non-human primates can present oral diseases. However, differences
among the dentition of the various species make it difficult to understand their 
dental features and associated diseases. This research hypothesizes that the
prevalence of dental disorders varies in the species studied according to
distinct types of diet.
METHODS: Forty-five syncraniums of the species Alouatta caraya, Alouatta guariba 
clamitans, Sapajus nigritus, Callithrix jacchus, and Callithrix penicillata were 
evaluated by visual inspection, magnifying glasses, and on cone-beam computed
tomography.
RESULTS: Disorders identified consisted of missing teeth before death, agenesis, 
dental calculus, dental wear, dental staining, dental fracture, exposure of pulp 
chamber, alveolar bone resorption, tooth discoloration, and persistence of
deciduous teeth. Alouatta guariba clamitans presented the most disorders.
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that neotropical primates have a high prevalence
of dental changes, even in free-living conditions, and that the differences
observed among them may be associated with different diet patterns.

The genes of the leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor (LILR) family map to the 
leukocyte receptor complex (LRC) on chromosome 19, and consist of both activating
and inhibiting entities. These receptors are often involved in regulating immune 
responses, and are considered to play a role in health and disease. The human
LILR region and evolutionary equivalents in some rodent and bird species have
been thoroughly characterized. In non-human primates, the LILR region is
annotated, but a thorough comparison between humans and non-human primates has
not yet been documented. Therefore, it was decided to undertake a comprehensive
comparison of the human and non-human primate LILR region at the genomic level.
During primate evolution the organization of the LILR region remained largely
conserved. One major exception, however, is provided by the common marmoset, a
New World monkey species, which seems to feature a substantial contraction of the
number of LILR genes in both the centromeric and the telomeric region.
Furthermore, genomic analysis revealed that the killer-cell immunoglobulin-like
receptor gene KIR3DX1, which maps in the LILR region, features one copy in humans
and great ape species. A second copy, which might have been introduced by a
duplication event, was observed in the lesser apes, and in Old and New World
monkey species. The highly conserved gene organization allowed us to standardize 
the LILR gene nomenclature for non-human primate species, and implies that most
of the receptors encoded by these genes likely fulfill highly preserved
functions.

Ticagrelor is a reversibly binding and selective oral P2Y(12) antagonist,
developed for the prevention of atherothrombotic events in patients with acute
coronary syndromes. The disposition and metabolism of [(14)C]ticagrelor was
investigated in mice, rats, and marmosets to demonstrate that these preclinical
toxicity species showed similar metabolic profiles to human. Incubations with
hepatocytes or microsomes from multiple species were also studied to compare with
in vivo metabolic profiles. The routes of excretion were similar for both oral
and intravenous administration in mice, rats, and marmosets with fecal excretion 
being the major elimination pathway accounting for 59 to 96% of the total
radioactivity administered. Urinary excretion of drug-related material accounted 
for only 1 to 15% of the total radioactivity administered. Milk samples from
lactating rats displayed significantly higher levels of total radioactivity than 
plasma after oral administration of ticagrelor. This demonstrated that ticagrelor
and/or its metabolites were readily transferred into rat milk and that neonatal
rats could be exposed to ticagrelor-related compounds via maternal milk.
Ticagrelor and active metabolite AR-C124910 (loss of hydroxyethyl side chain)
were the major components in plasma from all species studied and similar to human
plasma profiles. The primary metabolite of ticagrelor excreted in urine across
all species was an inactive metabolite, AR-C133913 (loss of
difluorophenylcyclopropyl group). Ticagrelor, AR-C124910, and AR-C133913 were the
major components found in feces from the three species examined. Overall, in vivo
metabolite profiles were qualitatively similar across all species and consistent 
with in vitro results.

and misaligned sound localization cues.

Previous studies have demonstrated that single neurons in the central nucleus of 
the inferior colliculus (ICC) are sensitive to multiple sound localization cues. 
We investigated the hypothesis that ICC neurons are specialized to encode
multiple sound localization cues that are aligned in space (as would naturally
occur from a single broadband sound source). Sound localization cues including
interaural time differences (ITDs), interaural level differences (ILDs), and
spectral shapes (SSs) were measured in a marmoset monkey. Virtual space methods
were used to generate stimuli with aligned and misaligned combinations of cues
while recording in the ICC of the same monkey. Mutual information (MI) between
spike rates and stimuli for aligned versus misaligned cues were compared. Neurons
with best frequencies (BFs) less than âˆ¼11 kHz mostly encoded information about a 
single sound localization cue, ITD or ILD depending on frequency, consistent with
the dominance of ear acoustics by either ITD or ILD at those frequencies. Most
neurons with BFs >11 kHz encoded information about multiple sound localization
cues, usually ILD and SS, and were sensitive to their alignment. In some neurons 
MI between stimuli and spike responses was greater for aligned cues, while in
others it was greater for misaligned cues. If SS cues were shifted to lower
frequencies in the virtual space stimuli, a similar result was found for neurons 
with BFs <11 kHz, showing that the cue interaction reflects the spectra of the
stimuli and not a specialization for representing SS cues. In general the results
show that ICC neurons are sensitive to multiple localization cues if they are
simultaneously present in the frequency response area of the neuron. However, the
representation is diffuse in that there is not a specialization in the ICC for
encoding aligned sound localization cues.

Recent studies find increasing evidence for vocal accommodation in nonhuman
primates, indicating that this form of vocal learning is more prevalent than
previously thought. Convergent vocal accommodation (i.e. becoming more similar to
partners) indicates social closeness. At the same time, however, becoming too
similar may compromise individual recognisability. This is especially problematic
if individual recognisability is an important part of the call function, like in 
long-distance contact calls. In contrast, in calls with a different function, the
trade-off between signalling social closeness and individual recognisability
might be less severe. We therefore hypothesized that the extent and consequences 
of accommodation depend on the function of a given call, and expected (1) more
accommodation in calls for which individual identity is less crucial and (2) that
individual identity is less compromised in calls that serve mainly to transmit
identity compared to calls where individual recognisability is less important. We
quantified vocal accommodation in three call types over the process of pair
formation in common marmoset monkeys (Callithrix jacchus, n = 20). These three
call types have different functions and vary with the degree to which they refer 
to individual identity of the caller. In accordance with our predictions, we
found that animals converged most in close contact calls (trill calls), but less 
in calls where individual identity is more essential (phee- and food calls). In
two out of three call types, the amount of accommodation was predicted by the
initial vocal distance. Moreover, accommodation led to a drop in statistical
individual recognisability in trill calls, but not in phee calls and food calls. 
Overall, our study shows that patterns of vocal accommodation vary between call
types with different functions, suggestive of trade-offs between signalling
social closeness and individual recognisability in marmoset vocalizations.

Amazonia has the richest primate fauna in the world. Nonetheless, the diversity
and distribution of Amazonian primates remain little known and the scarcity of
baseline data challenges their conservation. These challenges are especially
acute in the Amazonian arc of deforestation, the 2500 km long southern edge of
the Amazonian biome that is rapidly being deforested and converted to
agricultural and pastoral landscapes. Amazonian marmosets of the genus Mico are
little known endemics of this region and therefore a priority for research and
conservation efforts. However, even nascent conservation efforts are hampered by 
taxonomic uncertainties in this group, such as the existence of a potentially new
species from the Juruena-Teles Pires interfluve hidden within the M. emiliae
epithet. Here we test if these marmosets belong to a distinct species using new
morphological, phylogenomic, and geographic distribution data analysed within an 
integrative taxonomic framework. We discovered a new, pseudo-cryptic Mico species
hidden within the epithet M. emiliae, here described and named after Horacio
Schneider, the pioneer of molecular phylogenetics of Neotropical primates. We
also clarify the distribution, evolutionary and morphological relationships of
four other Mico species, bridging Linnean, Wallacean, and Darwinian shortfalls in
the conservation of primates in the Amazonian arc of deforestation.

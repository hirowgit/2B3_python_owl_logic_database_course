Studies of personality traits in common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) indicate
that there are five or six constructs-Sociability, Dominance, Neuroticism,
Openness, and two related to Conscientiousness. The present study attempted to
determine whether our earlier study of laboratory-housed individuals only yielded
three-Dominance, Sociability, and Neuroticism-because of a low amount of
between-subjects variance. To do so, we increased our sample size from 77 to 128.
In addition, we ascertained the reliability and validity of ratings and whether
polymorphisms related to the serotonin 1a receptor were associated with
personality. We found Sociability, Dominance, and Negative Affect factors that
resembled three domains found in previous studies, including ours. We also found 
an Openness and Impulsiveness factor, the latter of which bore some resemblance
to Conscientiousness, and two higher-order factors, Pro-sociality and Boldness.
In further analyses, we could not exclude the possibility that Pro-sociality and 
Boldness represented a higher-level of personality organization. Correlations
between personality factors and well-being were consistent with the definitions
of the factors. There were no significant associations between personality and
genotype. These results suggest that common marmoset personality structure varies
as a function of rearing or housing variables that have not yet been investigated
systematically.

Cytosolic sulfotransferase SULT1C subfamily is one of the most flexible gene
subfamilies during mammalian evolution. The physiological functions of SULT1C
enzymes still remain to be fully understood. In this study, common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus), a promising primate animal model, was used to investigate
the functional relevance of the SULT1C subfamily. Gene database search revealed 3
intact SULT1C genes and a pseudogene in its genome. These 4 genes were named
SULT1C1, SULT1C2, SULT1C3P, and SULT1C5, according to the sequence homology and
gene location. Since SULT1C5 is the orthologous gene for human SULT1C2P, we
propose, here, to revisit the designation of human SULT1C2P to SULT1C5P. Purified
recombinant SULT1C enzymes showed sulfating activities toward a variety of
xenobiotic compounds and thyroid hormones. Kinetic analysis revealed high
catalytic activities of SULT1C1 and SULT1C5 for 3,3'-T2. It appears therefore
that SULT1C isoforms may play a role in the thyroid hormone metabolism in common 
marmoset.

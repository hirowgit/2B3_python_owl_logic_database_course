Advances in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computational analysis
technology have enabled comparisons among various primate brains in a
three-dimensional electronic format. Results from comparative studies provide
information about common features across primates and species-specific features
of neuroanatomy. Investigation of various species of non-human primates is
important for understanding such features, but the majority of comparative MRI
studies have been based on experimental primates, such as common marmoset,
macaques, and chimpanzee. A major obstacle has been the lack of a database that
includes non-experimental primates' brain MRIs. To facilitate scientific
discoveries in the field of comparative neuroanatomy and brain evolution, we
launched a collaborative project to develop an open-resource repository of
non-human primate brain images obtained using ex vivo MRI. As an initial open
resource, here we release a collection of structural MRI and diffusion tensor
images obtained from 12 species: pygmy marmoset, owl monkey, white-fronted
capuchin, crab-eating macaque, Japanese macaque, bonnet macaque, toque macaque,
Sykes' monkey, red-tailed monkey, Schmidt's guenon, de Brazza's guenon, and lar
gibbon. Sixteen postmortem brain samples from the 12 species, stored in the Japan
Monkey Centre (JMC), were scanned using a 9.4-T MRI scanner and made available
through the JMC collaborative research program (
http://www.j-monkey.jp/BIR/index_e.html ). The expected significant contributions
of the JMC Primates Brain Imaging Repository include (1) resources for
comparative neuroscience research, (2) preservation of various primate brains,
including those of endangered species, in a permanent digital form, (3) resources
with higher resolution for identifying neuroanatomical features, compared to
previous MRI atlases, (4) resources for optimizing methods of scanning large
fixed brains, and (5) references for veterinary neuroradiology. User-initiated
research projects beyond these contributions are also anticipated.

Primate cortical evolution has been characterized by massive and disproportionate
expansion of a set of specific regions in the neocortex. The associated increase 
in neocortical neurons comes with a high metabolic cost, thus the functions
served by these regions must have conferred significant evolutionary advantage.
In the present series of analyses, we show that evolutionary high-expanding
cortex - as estimated from patterns of surface growth from several primate
species - shares functional connections with different brain networks in a
context-dependent manner. Specifically, we demonstrate that high-expanding cortex
is characterized by high internetwork functional connectivity; is recruited
flexibly over many different cognitive tasks; and changes its functional coupling
pattern between rest and a multimodal task-state. The capacity of high-expanding 
cortex to connect flexibly with various specialized brain networks depending on
particular cognitive requirements suggests that its selective growth and
sustainment in evolution may have been linked to an involvement in supramodal
cognition. In accordance with an evolutionary-developmental view, we find that
this observed ability of high-expanding regions - to flexibly modulate functional
connections as a function of cognitive state - emerges gradually through
childhood, with a prolonged developmental trajectory plateauing in young
adulthood.

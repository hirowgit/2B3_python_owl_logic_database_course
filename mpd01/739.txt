BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Human amnion epithelial cells (hAECs) are nonimmunogenic,
nontumorigenic, anti-inflammatory cells normally discarded with placental tissue.
We reasoned that their profile of biological features, wide availability, and the
lack of ethical barriers to their use could make these cells useful as a therapy 
in ischemic stroke.
METHODS: We tested the efficacy of acute (1.5 hours) or delayed (1-3 days)
poststroke intravenous injection of hAECs in 4 established animal models of
cerebral ischemia. Animals included young (7-14 weeks) and aged mice (20-22
months) of both sexes, as well as adult marmosets of either sex.
RESULTS: We found that hAECs administered 1.5 hours after stroke in mice migrated
to the ischemic brain via a CXC chemokine receptor type 4-dependent mechanism and
reduced brain inflammation, infarct development, and functional deficits.
Furthermore, if hAECs administration was delayed until 1 or 3 days poststroke,
long-term functional recovery was still augmented in young and aged mice of both 
sexes. We also showed proof-of-principle evidence in marmosets that acute
intravenous injection of hAECs prevented infarct development from day 1 to day 10
after stroke.
CONCLUSIONS: Systemic poststroke administration of hAECs elicits marked
neuroprotection and facilitates mechanisms of repair and recovery.

This study used Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) to identify potential
neurometabolitic markers of cognitive performance in male (n = 7) and female
(n = 8) middle-aged (∼5 years old) common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus).
Anesthetized marmosets were scanned with a 4.7 T/40 cm horizontal magnet equipped
with 450 mT/m magnetic field gradients and a 20 G/cm magnetic field gradient
insert, within 3 months of completing the CANTAB serial Reversal Learning task.
Neurometabolite concentrations of N-Acetyl Asparate, Myo-Inositol, Choline,
Phosphocreatine + creatine, Glutamate and Glutamine were acquired from a 3 mm3
voxel positioned in the Prefrontal Cortex (PFC). Males acquired the reversals
(but not simple discriminations) faster than the females. Higher PFC Glx
(glutamate + glutamine) concentration was associated with faster acquisition of
the reversals. Interestingly, the correlation between cognitive performance and
Glx was significant in males, but not in females. These results suggest that MRS 
is a useful tool to identify biochemical markers of cognitive performance in the 
healthy nonhuman primate brain and that biological sex modulates the relationship
between neurochemical composition and cognition.

Serum protein electrophoretic patterns of the marmoset, Callithrix jacchus.

Allchin JP, Evans GO.

Three electrophoretic procedures were used to separate protein fractions of
marmoset serum. The albumin of marmoset serum migrated further than that of human
serum with all three procedures and the number and size of the globulin fractions
differed with species and with procedure.

Platelet measurements in the common marmoset, Callithrix jacchus.

Evans GO, Smith DE.

Platelet counts and mean platelet volumes were determined for 39 male and 32
female adult marmoset whole blood samples and these results are compared with
previously published data. There is no evidence of a difference between sexes but
there is some evidence of a relationship between platelet count and mean platelet
volume in the Callithrix jacchus population studied.

The aging of the population and environmental noise have contributed to high
rates of presbycusis, also known as age-related hearing loss (ARHL). Because mice
have a relatively short life span, murine models have not been suitable for
determining the mechanism of presbycusis development and methods of diagnosis.
Although the common marmoset, a non-human primate (NHP), is an ideal animal model
for studying age-related diseases, its auditory spectrum has not been
systematically studied. Auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) from 38 marmosets of 
different ages demonstrated that auditory function correlated with age. Hearing
loss in geriatric common marmosets started at ultra-high frequency (>16 kHz),
then extended to lower frequencies. Despite age-related deterioration of ABR
threshold and amplitude in marmosets, outer hair cell (OHC) function remained
stable at all ages. Spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs), which are the first auditory 
neurons in the auditory system, were found to degenerate distinctly in aged
common marmosets, indicating that neural degeneration caused presbycusis in these
animals. Similarly, age-associated ABR deterioration without loss of OHC function
was observed in another NHP, rhesus monkeys. Audiometry results from these two
species of NHP suggested that NHPs were ideal for studying ARHL and that neural
presbycusis at high frequency may be prevalent in primates.

Precise spatiotemporal control of gene expression in the developing brain is
critical for neural circuit formation, and comprehensive expression mapping in
the developing primate brain is crucial to understand brain function in health
and disease. Here, we developed an unbiased, automated, large-scale,
cellular-resolution in situ hybridization (ISH)-based gene expression profiling
system (GePS) and companion analysis to reveal gene expression patterns in the
neonatal New World marmoset cortex, thalamus, and striatum that are distinct from
those in mice. Gene-ontology analysis of marmoset-specific genes revealed
associations with catalytic activity in the visual cortex and neuropsychiatric
disorders in the thalamus. Cortically expressed genes with clear area boundaries 
were used in a three-dimensional cortical surface mapping algorithm to delineate 
higher-order cortical areas not evident in two-dimensional ISH data. GePS
provides a powerful platform to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying
primate neurobiology and developmental psychiatric and neurological disorders.

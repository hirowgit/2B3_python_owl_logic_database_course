Monoamine oxidase (MAO) type B (MAO-B) inhibition was shown to confer
anti-parkinsonian benefit as monotherapy and adjunct to
L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) in clinical trials. Here, we explore the
anti-parkinsonian effect of MAO type A (MAO-A) inhibition as monotherapy, as the 
enzyme MAO-A is also encountered within the primate and human basal ganglia,
where it metabolises dopamine, albeit to a lesser extent than MAO-B. In six
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-lesioned marmosets, we
assessed the anti-parkinsonian effect of the reversible MAO-A inhibitor
moclobemide (0.1 and 1 mg/kg) as monotherapy and compared it to that of L-DOPA
and vehicle treatments. Moclobemide significantly reversed parkinsonism (by 39%, 
P < 0.01), while eliciting only mild dyskinesia and psychosis-like behaviours
(PLBs). In contrast, L-DOPA anti-parkinsonian effect was accompanied by marked
dyskinesia and PLBs. MAO-A inhibition with moclobemide may provide
anti-parkinsonian benefit when administered without L-DOPA and might perhaps be
considered as monotherapy for the treatment of Parkinson's disease in the early
stages of the condition.

In many mammalian species, the production of new neurons in the hippocampal
dentate gyrus continues throughout life. Previous studies using rodents suggest
that adult-born neurons are involved in memory and cognition tasks and mood
regulation. Interferon-alpha (IFNα), a proinflammatory cytokine used for the
treatment of chronic viral hepatitis and malignancies, frequently causes
depressive symptoms in patients and animals, including non-human primates. We
have previously demonstrated that chronic IFNα treatment decreases hippocampal
neurogenesis in mice. Here, we investigated the effects of four-week human
pegylated IFNα treatment on hippocampal neurogenesis and behavior in common
marmosets. Continuous monitoring of voluntary activity levels using an actigraphy
device suggested that adaptive ability is impaired in IFNα-treated animals.
Analyses of BrdU-labeled cells expressing a marker for immature or mature neurons
revealed a significant reduction in the number of new neurons in the hippocampus 
of IFNα-treated animals. These data indicate that chronic human IFNα treatment
causes behavioral changes and a decrease in hippocampal neurogenesis in common
marmosets.

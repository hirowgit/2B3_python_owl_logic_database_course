Previous studies have demonstrated that patients with schizophrenia show greater 
sensitivity to psychostimulants than healthy subjects. Sensitization to
psychostimulants and resultant alteration of dopaminergic neurotransmission in
rodents has been suggested as a useful model of schizophrenia. This study sought 
to examine the use of methylphenidate as a psychostimulant to induce dopamine
release and that of [(18)F]fallypride as a radioligand to quantify the release in
a primate model of schizophrenia. Four common marmosets were scanned by positron 
emission tomography twice, before and after methylphenidate challenge, to
evaluate dopamine release. Four other marmosets were sensitized by repeated
methamphetamine (MAP) administration. Then, they were scanned twice, before and
after methylphenidate challenge, to evaluate whether MAP-sensitization induced
greater sensitivity to methylphenidate. We revealed a main effect of the
methylphenidate challenge but not the MAP pretreatment on the striatal binding
potential. These results suggest that methylphenidate-induced striatal dopamine
release in the common marmoset could be evaluated by [(18)F]fallypride.

Oxytocin is a key regulator of social bonding and is positively linked to
affiliation and prosocial behavior in several mammal species. In chimpanzees,
this link is dyad-specific as affiliative interactions only elicit high oxytocin 
release if they involve strongly bonded individuals. These studies involved
isolated dyads and sampling events. Little is known about the role of oxytocin in
affiliation and social bonding, and about potential long-term patterns of
bonding-related and dyad-specific oxytocin effects within highly affiliative and 
cooperative social groups. Our aim was to investigate whether bonding-related
oxytocin signatures linked to dyadic affiliation are present in family groups of 
cooperatively breeding marmoset monkeys (Callithrix jacchus) that show high
levels of cohesion and cooperation. In 30 dyads from four family groups and one
pair, we measured urinary baseline oxytocin over six weeks and analyzed the link 
to bond strength (mean dyadic affiliation). Strongly bonded dyads showed
synchronized longitudinal fluctuations of oxytocin, indicating that dyad-specific
oxytocin effects can also be traced in the group context and in an interdependent
species. We discuss these results in light of the potential function of
differentiated relationships between marmoset dyads other than the breeding pair,
and the role of oxytocin as a mediator for social bonding.

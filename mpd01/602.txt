The mouse embryo is the canonical model for mammalian preimplantation
development. Recent advances in single cell profiling allow detailed analysis of 
embryogenesis in other eutherian species, including human, to distinguish
conserved from divergent regulatory programs and signalling pathways in the
rodent paradigm. Here, we identify and compare transcriptional features of human,
marmoset and mouse embryos by single cell RNA-seq. Zygotic genome activation
correlates with the presence of polycomb repressive complexes in all three
species, while ribosome biogenesis emerges as a predominant attribute in primate 
embryos, supporting prolonged translation of maternally deposited RNAs. We find
that transposable element expression signatures are species, stage and lineage
specific. The pluripotency network in the primate epiblast lacks certain
regulators that are operative in mouse, but encompasses WNT components and genes 
associated with trophoblast specification. Sequential activation of GATA6, SOX17 
and GATA4 markers of primitive endoderm identity is conserved in primates.
Unexpectedly, OTX2 is also associated with primitive endoderm specification in
human and non-human primate blastocysts. Our cross-species analysis demarcates
both conserved and primate-specific features of preimplantation development, and 
underscores the molecular adaptability of early mammalian embryogenesis.

We investigated the viability of a combined repeated dose toxicity study,
including toxicokinetics (TK), in common marmosets according to the ICH-S4,
ICH-S3A and ICH-S7A Guidelines using valsartan as test article whose non-clinical
repeated dose toxicity studies had been conducted using this species for
regulatory purpose. Valsartan was administered orally to 3 animals/sex at 200
mg/kg/day for 2 weeks. In addition to the routine parameters in repeated dose
toxicity studies, safety pharmacology parameters (examinations of the central
nervous, respiratory and cardiovascular systems) were also evaluated. The Plasma 
Micro Sampling Toxicokinetics (PMS-TK) method required ultrasensitive
quantitation, was employed to evaluate the relationship between toxic changes and
plasma concentrations as well as the effects of frequent blood sampling in
individual animals. In valsartan, toxic findings (a deteriorated physical
condition; moribundity of one male and one female on Day 14; sporadic vomitus;
decreases in body weights and food consumption; decreases in erythrocytic
parameters; and renal changes such as an increase in urea nitrogen, dilation of
the tubules and hypertrophy of the tubular epithelium) were similar and plasma
concentrations comparable to the results in the approval information.
Furthermore, no side effects caused by frequent blood sampling were confirmed in 
the negative control group. Consequently, a combined repeated dose toxicity study
including TK analysis using the PMS-TK method is viable in common marmosets and
contributes to animal welfare.

Highly palatible foods may induce addiction-related behaviors. However, this has 
yet to be established in non-human primates. Therefore, we evaluated whether
marmoset monkeys (Calllithrix penicillata) acquire a conditioned-place-preference
(CPP) for chocolate and if this response is detectable after a 24-h and 15-day
period. Subjects were first habituated to a two-compartment CPP box and then
randomly assigned to a chocolate or control group. Thereafter, they were given
access to only one compartment during daily 15-min conditionings, held on six
consecutive days. On each trial, the chocolate group received pieces of chocolate
(50g) in this context, whereas controls were not given a food reward. Marmosets
were subsequently tested for preferring this (food) paired context after a 24-h
and 15-day interval. During conditioning, individual foraging and the amount of
chocolate ingested by each pair of the chocolate group remained constant.
However, compared to pre-CPP levels, the time spent inside/in contact with the
conditioned compartment increased significantly, while the latency to first entry
decreased on both post-CPP intervals. For controls, the parameters remained
unaltered. Thus, chocolate induced a persistent CPP response-an aspect usually
associated with drug-related rewards.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is increasingly being utilised as a
nonhuman primate model for human disease, ranging from autoimmune to infectious
disease. In order to fully exploit these models, meaningful comparison to the
human host response is necessary. Commercially available reagents, primarily
targeted to human cells, were utilised to assess the phenotype and activation
status of key immune cell types and cytokines in naive and infected animals.
Single cell suspensions of blood, spleen, and lung were examined. Generally, the 
phenotype of cells was comparable between humans and marmosets, with
approximately 63% of all lymphocytes in the blood of marmosets being T cells, 25%
B-cells, and 12% NK cells. The percentage of neutrophils in marmoset blood were
more similar to human values than mouse values. Comparison of the activation
status of cells following experimental systemic or inhalational infection
exhibited different trends in different tissues, most obvious in cell types
active in the innate immune response. This work significantly enhances the
ability to understand the immune response in these animals and fortifies their
use as models of infectious disease.

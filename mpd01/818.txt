Previous studies showed that olfactory cues are important for mammalian
communication. However, many specific compounds that convey information between
conspecifics are still unknown. To understand mechanisms and functions of
olfactory cues, olfactory signals such as volatile compounds emitted from
individuals need to be assessed. Sampling of animals with and without scent
glands was typically conducted using cotton swabs rubbed over the skin or fur and
analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). However, this method
has various drawbacks, including a high level of contaminations. Thus, we adapted
two methods of volatile sampling from other research fields and compared them to 
sampling with cotton swabs. To do so we assessed the body odor of common
marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) using cotton swabs, thermal desorption (TD) tubes 
and, alternatively, a mobile GC-MS device containing a thermal desorption trap.
Overall, TD tubes comprised most compounds (N = 113), with half of those
compounds being volatile (N = 52). The mobile GC-MS captured the fewest compounds
(N = 35), of which all were volatile. Cotton swabs contained an intermediate
number of compounds (N = 55), but very few volatiles (N = 10). Almost all
compounds found with the mobile GC-MS were also captured with TD tubes (94%).
Hence, we recommend TD tubes for state of the art sampling of body odor of
mammals or other vertebrates, particularly for field studies, as they can be
easily transported, stored and analysed with high performance instruments in the 
lab. Nevertheless, cotton swabs capture compounds which still may contribute to
the body odor, e.g. after bacterial fermentation, while profiles from mobile
GC-MS include only the most abundant volatiles of the body odor.

Reptiles are the first amniotes to develop an intromitent penis, however until
now the mechanisms involved in the electrical field stimulation-induced
contraction on corpora cavernosa isolated from Crotalus durissus terrificus were 
not investigated. Crotalus and rabbit corpora cavernosa were mounted in 10 mL
organ baths for isometric tension recording. Electrical field stimulation
(EFS)-induced contractions were performed in presence/absence of phentolamine (10
μM), guanethidine (30 μM), tetrodotoxin (1 μM and 1mM), A-803467 (10 μM),
3-iodo-L-Tyrosine (1 mM), salsolinol (3 μM) and a modified Krebs solution
(equimolar substitution of NaCl by N-methyl-D-glucamine). Immuno-histochemistry
for tyrosine hydroxylase was also performed. Electrical field stimulation (EFS; 8
Hz and 16 Hz) caused contractions in both Crotalus and rabbit corpora cavernosa. 
The contractions were abolished by previous incubation with either phentolamine
or guanethidine. Tetrodotoxin (1 μM) also abolished the EFS-induced contractions 
of rabbit CC, but did not affect EFS-induced contractions of Crotalus CC.
Addition of A-803467 (10 μM) did not change the EFS-induced contractions of
Crotalus CC but abolished rabbit CC contractions. 3-iodo-L-Tyrosine and
salsolinol had no effect on EFS-induced contractions of Crotalus CC and Rabbit
CC. Replacement of NaCl by N- Methyl-D-glucamine (NMDG) abolished EFS-induced
contractions of rabbit CC, but did not affect Crotalus CC. The presence of
tyrosine hydroxylase was identified in endothelial cells only of Crotalus CC.
Since the EFS-induced contractions of Crotalus CC is dependent on catecholamine
release, insensitive to TTX, insensitive to A803467 and to NaCl replacement, it
indicates that the source of cathecolamine is unlikely to be from adrenergic
terminals. The finding that tyrosine hydroxylase is present in endothelial cells 
suggests that these cells can modulate Crotalus CC tone.

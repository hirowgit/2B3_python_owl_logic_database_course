Analysis of electrophysiological data from Purkinje cells (P-cells) of the
cerebellum presents unique challenges to spike sorting. Complex spikes have
waveforms that vary significantly from one event to the next, raising the problem
of misidentification. Even when complex spikes are detected correctly, the simple
spikes may belong to a different P-cell, raising the danger of misattribution. To
address these identification and attribution problems, we wrote an open-source,
semiautomated software called P-sort, and then tested it by analyzing data from
P-cells recorded in three species: marmosets, macaques, and mice. Like other
sorting software, P-sort relies on nonlinear dimensionality reduction to cluster 
spikes. However, it also uses the statistical relationship between simple and
complex spikes to merge disparate clusters and split a single cluster. In
comparison with expert manual curation, occasionally P-sort identified
significantly more complex spikes, as well as prevented misattribution of
clusters. Three existing automatic sorters performed less well, particularly for 
identification of complex spikes. To improve the development of analysis tools
for the cerebellum, we provide labeled data for 313 recording sessions, as well
as statistical characteristics of waveforms and firing patterns of P-cells in
three species.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Algorithms that perform spike sorting depend on
waveforms to cluster spikes. However, a cerebellar Purkinje-cell produces two
types of spikes; simple and complex spikes. A complex spike coincides with the
suppression of generating simple spikes. Here, we recorded neurophysiological
data from three species and developed a spike analysis software named P-sort that
relies on this statistical property to improve both the detection and the
attribution of simple and complex spikes in the cerebellum.

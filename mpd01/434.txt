Metformin has beneficial effects on several age-related diseases (e.g., diabetes,
obesity, cancer) and extends lifespan in nematodes and mice. Acarbose, an
FDA-approved agent for treating type 2 diabetes, prevents breakdown of complex
carbohydrates. Both compounds have been suggested as potential anti-aging
interventions and acarbose has been shown to extend mouse longevity by the
Intervention Testing Program (ITP). One potential next step is to assess the
effect of these interventions on healthspan and lifespan in non-human primates.
The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a small new world monkey with a
relatively short life span and small size, both valuable for the translation
potential of this nonhuman primate species for the study of aging and chronic
disease. However, the dosing and assessment of potential side effects of either
metformin or acarbose in this species have yet to be assessed. This study
evaluated the pharmacokinetics of two dosage levels each of metformin or acarbose
(given separately) in two small groups of young marmosets (n = 5/group) treated
for 24 h to define the pharmacokinetics of each drug. The ability to rapidly and 
reliably dose socially housed marmosets with an oral form of acarbose or
metformin that is well tolerated indicates that this species is a reliable model 
for testing acarbose and metformin in a safe and efficient way in a long-term
intervention.

Discoveries over the past two decades demonstrate that regions distributed
throughout the association cortex, often called the default network, are
suppressed during tasks that demand external attention and are active during
remembering, envisioning the future and making social inferences. This Review
describes progress in understanding the organization and function of networks
embedded within these association regions. Detailed high-resolution analyses of
single individuals suggest that the default network is not a single network, as
historically described, but instead comprises multiple interwoven networks. The
multiple networks share a common organizational motif (also evident in marmoset
and macaque anatomical circuits) that might support a general class of processing
function dependent on internally constructed rather than externally constrained
representations, with each separate interwoven network specialized for a distinct
processing domain. Direct neuronal recordings in humans and monkeys reveal
evidence for competitive relationships between the internally and externally
oriented networks. Findings from rodent studies suggest that the thalamus might
be essential to controlling which networks are engaged through specialized
thalamic reticular neurons, including antagonistic subpopulations. These
association networks (and presumably thalamocortical circuits) are expanded in
humans and might be particularly vulnerable to dysregulation implicated in
mental illness.

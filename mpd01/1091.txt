We identified a novel repeat family, termed Platy-1, in the Callithrix jacchus
(common marmoset) genome that arose around the time of the divergence of
platyrrhines and catarrhines and established itself as a repeat family in New
World monkeys (NWMs). A full-length Platy-1 element is ∼100 bp in length, making 
it the shortest known short interspersed element (SINE) in primates, and harbors 
features characteristic of non-LTR retrotransposons. We identified 2268
full-length Platy-1 elements across 62 subfamilies in the common marmoset genome.
Our subfamily reconstruction and phylogenetic analyses support Platy-1
propagation throughout the evolution of NWMs in the lineage leading to C. jacchus
Platy-1 appears to have reached its amplification peak in the common ancestor of 
current day marmosets and has since moderately declined. However, identification 
of more than 200 Platy-1 elements identical to their respective consensus
sequence, and the presence of polymorphic elements within common marmoset
populations, suggests ongoing retrotransposition activity. Platy-1, a SINE,
appears to have originated from an Alu element, and hence is likely derived from 
7SL RNA. Our analyses illustrate the birth of a new repeat family and its
propagation dynamics in the lineage leading to the common marmoset over the last 
40 million years.

1. The pharmacokinetic data of cytochrome P450 probes in humans can be
extrapolated from corresponding data in cynomolgus monkeys, dogs and minipigs
using simplified physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling. In this
study, the modeling methodology was further adapted to estimate human plasma
concentrations of P450 probes based on data from mice transplanted with human
hepatocytes or based on data from marmosets. 2. Using known species allometric
scaling factors, the observed plasma concentrations of caffeine, warfarin,
omeprazole, metoprolol, and midazolam in chimeric TK-NOG mice with humanized
liver were scaled to human oral monitoring equivalents. Using the same approach, 
the previously reported pharmacokinetics of the five P450 probes in marmosets
were also scaled to reported equivalents in humans using in vitro metabolic
clearance data. 3. Human plasma concentration profiles of the five P450 probes
estimated by simplified human PBPK models based on the observed pharmacokinetics 
in mice with humanized liver and on the reported pharmacokinetics in marmosets
were consistent with previously published pharmacokinetic data in Caucasians.
4. These results suggest that mice with humanized liver and/or marmosets could be
suitable pharmacokinetic models for humans during research into new drugs,
especially when used in combination with simple PBPK models.

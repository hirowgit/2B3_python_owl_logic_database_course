A monkey model of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection is urgently needed to better
understand transmission and pathogenesis, given its proven association with fetal
brain defects in pregnant women and acute neurological illness. Here we
experimentally infected 4 male marmosets with ZIKV (prototype 1947 African
strain) and monitored them clinically with sampling of various body fluids and
tissues for nearly 3 months. We show that the course of acute infection with ZIKV
in these New World monkeys resembles the human illness in many respects,
including (1) lack of apparent clinical symptoms in most cases, (2) persistence
of the virus in body fluids such as semen and saliva for longer periods of time
than in serum, and (3) generation of neutralizing antibodies as well as an
antiviral immunological host response. Importantly, ZIKV-infected saliva samples 
(in addition to serum) were found to be infectious, suggesting potential capacity
for viral transmission by the oral route. Re-challenge of a previously infected
marmoset with a contemporary outbreak strain SPH2015 from Brazil resulted in
continued protection against infection, no viral shedding, and boosting of the
immune response. Given the key similarities to human infection, a marmoset model 
of ZIKV infection may be useful for testing of new drugs and vaccines.

The circadian system is organized in a hierarchy of multiple oscillators, with
the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) as the master oscillator in mammals. The SCN is
formed by a group of coupled cell oscillators. Knowledge of this coupling
mechanism is essential to understanding entrainment and the expression of
circadian rhythms. Some authors suggest that light-dark (LD) cycles with periods 
near the limit of entrainment may be good models for promoting internal
desynchronization, providing knowledge about the coupling mechanism. As such, we 
evaluated the circadian activity rhythm (CAR) pattern of marmosets in LD cycles
at lower limits of entrainment in order to study induced internal dissociation.
To that end, two experiments were conducted: (1) 6 adult females were under
symmetrical LD cycles T21, T22 and T21.5 for 60, 35 and 48 days, respectively;
and (2) 4 male and 4 female adults were under T21 for 24 days followed by 18 days
of LL, back to T21 for 24 days, followed by 14 days of LL. The CAR of each animal
was continuously recorded. In experiment 1, vocalizations were also recorded.
Under Ts shorter than 24 days, a dissociation pattern was observed for CAR and
vocalizations. Two simultaneous circadian components emerged, one with the same
period as the LD cycle, called the light-entrained component, and the other in
free-running, denominated the non-light-entrained component. Both components were
displayed in the CAR for all the animals in T21, five animals (83.3%) in T21.5
and two animals (33.3%) in T22. Our results are in accordance with the
multioscillatory nature of the circadian system. Dissociation is partial
synchronization to the LD cycle, with at least one group of oscillators
synchronized by relative coordination and masking, while another group of
oscillators free runs, but is also masked by the LD cycle. Since only T21
promoted the emergence of both circadian components in the circadian rhythms of
all marmosets, it was considered the promoter period of circadian rhythm
dissociation in this species, and is proposed as a good animal model for forced
desynchronization in non-human diurnal primates.

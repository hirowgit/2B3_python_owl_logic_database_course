Interactions between motor systems and sensory processing are ubiquitous
throughout the animal kingdom and play an important role in many sensorimotor
behaviors, including both human speech and animal vocalization. During vocal
production, the auditory system plays important roles in both encoding feedback
of produced sounds, allowing one to self-monitor for vocal errors, and
simultaneously maintaining sensitivity to the outside acoustic environment.
Supporting these roles is an efferent motor-to-sensory signal known as a
corollary discharge. This review summarizes recent work on the role of such
signaling during vocalization in the marmoset monkey, a nonhuman primate model of
social vocal communication.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is one of the most widespread neurodevelopmental
disorders, characterized by impairment in social interactions, and restricted
stereotyped behaviors. Using immunohistochemistry and positron emission
tomography (PET), several studies have provided evidence of the existence of
activated microglia in ASD patients. Recently, we developed an animal model of
ASD using the new world monkey common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) and
demonstrated ASD-like social impairment after the in utero administration of
valproic acid (VPA). To characterize microglia in this marmoset model of ASD from
early toddler to adult, morphological analyses of microglia in VPA marmosets and 
age-matched unexposed (UE) marmosets were performed using immunohistochemistry
for microglia-specific markers, Iba1, and P2RY12. The most robust morphological
difference between VPA marmosets and UE marmosets throughout the life span
evaluated were the microglia processes in VPA marmosets being frequently
segmented by thin and faintly Iba1-positive structures. The segmentation of
microglial processes was only rarely observed in UE marmosets. This feature of
segmentation of microglial processes in VPA marmosets can also be observed in
images from previous studies on ASD conducted in humans and animal models.
Apoptotic cells have been shown to have segmented processes. Therefore, our
results might suggest that microglia in patients and animals with ASD symptoms
could frequently be in the apoptotic phase with high turnover rates of microglia 
found in some pathological conditions.

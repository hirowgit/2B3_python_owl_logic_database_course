Three field seasons of exploration along the Río Alto Madre de Dios in Peruvian
Amazonia have yielded a fauna of micromammals from a new locality AMD-45, at
∼12.8°S. So far we have identified the new primate described here as well as
small caviomorph rodents, cenolestoid marsupials, interatheriid notoungulates,
xenarthrans, fish, lizards and invertebrates. The site is in the Bala Formation
as exposed where the river transects a syncline. U-Pb dates on detrital zircons
constrain the locality's age at between 17.1 ± 0.7 Ma and 18.9 ± 0.7 Ma, making
the fauna age-equivalent to that from the Pinturas Formation and the older parts 
of the Santa Cruz Formation of Patagonian Argentina (Santacrucian). The primate
specimen is an unworn M1 of exceptionally small size (equivalent in size to the
extant callitrichine, Callithrix jacchus, among the smallest living platyrrhines 
and the smallest Eocene-Early Miocene platyrrhine yet recorded). Despite its
small size it is unlike extant callitrichines in having a prominent cingulum
hypocone. Based on the moderate development of the buccal crests, this animal
likely had a diet similar to that of frugivorous callitrichines, and distinctly
different from the more similarly-sized gummivores, Cebuella and C. jacchus. The 
phyletic position of the new taxon is uncertain, especially given the
autapomorphic character of the tooth as a whole. Nevertheless, its unusual
morphology hints at a wholly original and hitherto unknown Amazonian fauna, and
reinforces the impression of the geographic separation of the Amazonian tropics
from the more geographically isolated southerly parts of the continent in Early
Miocene times.

Marmosets have attracted significant interest in the life sciences. Similarities 
with human brain anatomy and physiology, such as the granular frontal cortex, as 
well as the development of transgenic lines and potential for transferring rodent
neuroscientific techniques to small primates make them a promising
neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric model system. However, whether marmosets
can exhibit complex motor tasks in highly controlled experimental designs-one of 
the prerequisites for investigating higher-order control mechanisms underlying
cognitive motor behavior-has not been demonstrated. We show that marmosets can be
trained to perform vocal behavior in response to arbitrary visual cues in
controlled operant conditioning tasks. Our results emphasize the marmoset as a
suitable model to study complex motor behavior and the evolution of cognitive
control underlying speech.

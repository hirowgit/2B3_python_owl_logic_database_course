The behavior of eight adult male marmosets that were bilaterally castrated during
neonatal life (postnatal days 1-7), a single unilaterally castrated male, and
eight age-matched intact adult males was observed during encounter tests with
unfamiliar conspecifics. When neonatally castrated (NC) males encountered
ovariectomized, estradiol-treated females, both partners were intensely
aggressive and 66% of tests were terminated to avoid injuries. No mounts
occurred, and females exhibited little or no sexual initiating behavior
(proceptivity) towards NC males. By contrast, encounters between NC males and
intact adult males were characterized by low levels of aggression and no tests
were terminated. Intact males frequently mounted NC males. However, NC males
initiated only 4% of these mounts by intact males and they refused or terminated 
67% of mount attempts and mounts by intact males. The age-matched intact adult
males provided data which differed markedly from those obtained using NC males.
The intact males were highly aggressive during encounters with other intact
males, whereas they mounted and ejaculated when paired with females. The single
male which had been unilaterally castrated in infancy provided similar results to
the intact males. These experiments indicate that neonatal castration has
profound effects upon the development of sexual and aggressive behavior in male
marmosets. However, the stimulus qualities as well as the behavior of males are
altered by neonatal castration, so that unfamiliar conspecifics react towards
them as females during paired encounters. This finding complicates the
interpretation of effects of neonatal castration upon development of sexually
dimorphic behavioral patterns in male marmosets. Behavioral effects of castration
later in postnatal development romain to be determined. © 1993 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Mortality statistics from five populations of small New World monkeys (includinsg
Callithrix jaccus, Leontopithecus rosalia, Saguinus fuscicollis, and Saguinus
oedipus) were combined to generate a standard model life table reflecting the
mortality patterns of these primates. The model is applied to three individual
populations to illustrate a strategy for smoothing and interpolating mortality
statistics of varying completeness and quality. © 1993 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a non-human primate that could prove 
useful as human pharmacokinetic and biomedical research models. The cytochromes
P450 (P450s) are a superfamily of enzymes that have critical roles in drug
metabolism and disposition via monooxygenation of a broad range of xenobiotics;
however, information on some marmoset P450s is currently limited. Therefore,
identification and quantitative analysis of tissue-specific mRNA transcripts,
including those of P450s and flavin-containing monooxygenases (FMO, another
monooxygenase family), need to be carried out in detail before the marmoset can
be used as an animal model in drug development. De novo assembly and expression
analysis of marmoset transcripts were conducted with pooled liver, intestine,
kidney, and brain samples from three male and three female marmosets. After
unique sequences were automatically aligned by assembling software, the mean
contig length was 718 bp (with a standard deviation of 457 bp) among a total of
47,883 transcripts. Approximately 30% of the total transcripts were matched to
known marmoset sequences. Gene expression in 18 marmoset P450- and 4 FMO-like
genes displayed some tissue-specific patterns. Of these, the three most highly
expressed in marmoset liver were P450 2D-, 2E-, and 3A-like genes. In
extrahepatic tissues, including brain, gene expressions of these monooxygenases
were lower than those in liver, although P450 3A4 (previously P450 3A21) in
intestine and P450 4A11- and FMO1-like genes in kidney were relatively highly
expressed. By means of massive parallel long-read sequencing and short-read
technology applied to marmoset liver, intestine, kidney, and brain, the combined 
next-generation sequencing analyses reported here were able to identify novel
marmoset drug-metabolizing P450 transcripts that have until now been little
reported. These results provide a foundation for mechanistic studies and pave the
way for the use of marmosets as model animals for drug development in the future.

Interest is rising for animal modeling of pathological gambling. Using the
operant probabilistic-delivery task (PDT), gambling proneness can be evaluated in
laboratory animals. Drawing a comparison with rats, this study evaluated the
common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) using a PDT. By nose- or hand-poking,
subjects learnt to prefer a large (LLL, 5-6 pellets) over a small (SS, 1-2
pellets) reward and, subsequently, the probability of occurrence of large-reward 
delivery was decreased progressively to very low levels (from 100% to 17% and
14%). As probability decreased, subjects showed a great versus little shift in
preference from LLL to SS reinforcer. Hence, two distinct subpopulations
("non-gambler" versus "gambler") were differentiated within each species. A proof
of the model validity comes from marmosets' reaction to reward-delivery omission.
Namely, depending on individual temperament ("gambler" versus "non-gambler"),
they showed either persistence (i.e., inadequate pokes towards LLL) or
restlessness (i.e., inadequate pokes towards SS), respectively. In conclusion,
the marmoset could be a suitable model for preclinical gambling studies.
Implementation of the PDT to species other than rats may be relevant for
determining its external validity/generalizability and improving its
face/construct validity.

INTRODUCTION: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an enigmatic autoimmune-driven
inflammatory/demyelinating disease of the human central nervous system (CNS),
affecting brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves. The cause of the disease is not
known and the number of effective treatments is limited. Despite some clear
successes, translation of immunological discoveries in the mouse experimental
autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model into effective therapies for MS patients
has been difficult. This translation gap between MS and its elected EAE animal
model reflects the phylogenetic distance between humans and their experimental
counterpart, the inbred/specific pathogen free (SPF) laboratory mouse.
OBJECTIVE: Here, we discuss that important new insights can be obtained into the 
mechanistic basis of the therapy paradox from the study of nonhuman primate EAE
(NHP-EAE) models, the well-validated EAE model in common marmosets (Callithrix
jacchus) in particular.
INTERPRETATION: Data presented in this review demonstrate that due to a
considerable immunological and pathological overlap with mouse EAE on one side
and MS on the other, the NHP EAE model can help us bridge the translation gap.

INTRODUCTION: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the presence of
arboviruses from the Flavivirus genus in asymptomatic free-living non-human
primates (NHPs) living in close contact with humans and vectors in the States of 
Paraná and Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil.
METHODS: NHP sera samples (total n = 80, Alouatta spp. n = 07, Callithrix spp. n 
= 29 and Sapajus spp. n = 44) were screened for the presence of viral genomes
using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and 10% polyacrylamide gel 
electrophoresis techniques.
RESULTS: All of the samples were negative for the Flavivirus genome following the
10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: These negative results indicate that the analyzed animals were not
infected with arboviruses from the Flavivirus genus and did not represent a risk 
for viral transmission through vectors during the period in which the samples
were collected.

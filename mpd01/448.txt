Preexisting neutralizing antibody (NAb) against human adenovirus serotype 5
(AdHu5) can reduce the immunogenicity of AdHu5 vector-based vaccine, thus
inhibiting the host's immune response and utility of other homologous vectors.
Common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a small new world primate, has attracted
considerable attention for its potential as a preclinical research model of
vaccine development. However, the prevalence of anti-AdHu5 NAb activity in common
marmosets bred in China remains unknown. A recombinant adenovirus expressing
luciferase and Zs Green reporter genes were constructed to detect NAb against
rAdHu5 by flow cytometry (FCM) and chemiluminescence (CL) assay. Five of 25
marmosets (20%) presented AdHu5 NAb detectable by FCM. Four animals had low titer
(1/16), while the fifth one reached 1/64. While by CL assay, 7 of 25 (28%)
marmosets were anti-AdHu5 NAb positive. Four animals, two of whom were negative
by FCM, also had low titer NAb (1/16), suggesting assay discrepancy at low
levels. Two marmosets, 1/32 titer by CL, were at 1/16 by FCM. A single animal
showed a high titer with both assays (1/128 and 1/64 by CL and FCM,
respectively). The CL method was simpler, more sensitive, accurate, and stable.
The low prevalence of preexisting anti-AdHu5 NAb in marmosets provides important 
background information on the feasibility and applicability of using marmosets as
a preclinical research model for vaccine development.

Common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) are susceptible to intestinal inflammation 
which leads to chronic diarrhea, weight loss, and vitamin D deficiency. We
examined food intake and digestion in three mixed-sex groups of adult marmosets
maintained on three commercial base diets. Animals underwent two consecutive
4-day digestion trials. Body mass stayed constant. Feces and diet were assayed
for Mn, fat, and gross energy (GE). Apparent digestibility of dry matter (ADDM)
was calculated by the total collection method and from dietary and fecal Mn; the 
methods produced correlated results (r = 0.658, p < 0.001). Apparent
digestibility of energy (ADE) was calculated from ADDM and the GE of feces and
diet; apparent digestibility of fat (ADfat) was calculated from ADDM and fecal
fat. ADDM and ADE varied by diet (p < 0.001). We found poor digesters on all
three diets. The concentration of fecal fat was inversely related to ADE
(r = -0.729, p < 0.001). High fecal fat (>10%) was associated with ADfat of zero,
consistent with lipid malabsorption. Mean digestible energy intake (DEI) was
equal to 1.5 the estimated metabolic rate, but varied widely between individuals.
The diet with the fewest animals with high fecal fat had the highest mean DEI and
most animals above 450 g, suggesting it may be obesogenic.

Study of avian and piscine species has shown that animals with stronger
lateralization of the brain are able to perform two tasks presented
simultaneously better than can animals with weaker lateralization. We
investigated whether this might apply also to primates by testing common
marmosets to see whether there is a relationship between the strength of hand
preference, as an indicator of strength of brain lateralization, and the ability 
to carry out two tasks simultaneously. A model predator was introduced into the
testing room while the marmoset was foraging. Marmosets with stronger hand
preferences detected the 'predator' after shorter latency than those with weaker 
hand preferences. Furthermore, the marmosets with stronger hand preferences
produced more mobbing (tsik) vocalizations when they reacted to the predators
than did those with weaker hand preferences. There was no such association
between hand preference and either latency to respond to the predator or mobbing 
reaction when the marmosets were not foraging at the time the predator was
introduced. Hence, strength of lateralization is associated with the ability to
perform foraging and predator detection simultaneously. These results are
discussed with reference to the evolution of brain lateralization.

The developmental anatomy of the brain is largely directed by neural-based cues. 
Despite this knowledge, the developmental trajectory of the primate brain has not
yet been fully characterized. To realize this goal, the advance in noninvasive
imaging methods and new brain atlases are essential. The common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus), a small New World primate, is widely used in neuroscience
research. The recent introduction of transgenic techniques has enabled the
marmoset to be used as a genetically modifiable primate model for brain
development. Here, a magnetic resonance histology technique involving the use of 
ultra-high-resolution ex vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed to
identify the developmental anatomy of the marmoset brain at different time points
from gestational week 8 through to birth. The data allowed the generation of a
multidimensional atlas of brain structures at different developmental stages.
Furthermore, in utero MRI techniques were developed to noninvasively monitor
brain development during the embryonic and fetal stages. The multidimensional
atlas and the MRI tools developed herein are anticipated to further our
understanding of the developing primate brain.

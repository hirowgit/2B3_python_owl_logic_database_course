We studied personality, subjective well-being, and hair cortisol level, in common
marmosets Callithrix jacchus, a small, cooperatively breeding New World monkey,
by examining their associations with one another and genotypes. Subjects were 68 
males and 9 females that lived in the RIKEN Center for Life Science Technologies.
Personality and subjective well-being were assessed by keeper ratings on two
questionnaires, hair samples were obtained to assay cortisol level and buccal
swabs were used to assess AVPR1a, OPRM1 and DAT genotypes. Three personality
domains-Dominance, Sociability, and Neuroticism-were identified. Consistent with 
findings in other species, Sociability and Neuroticism were related to higher and
lower subjective well-being, respectively. Sociability was also associated with
higher hair cortisol levels. The personality domains and hair cortisol levels
were heritable and associated with genotypes: the short form of AVPR1a was
associated with lower Neuroticism and the AA genotype of the A111T SNP of OPRM1
was related to lower Dominance, lower Neuroticism, and higher hair cortisol
level. Some genetic associations were not in directions that one would expect
given findings in other species. These findings provide insights into the
proximate and ultimate bases of personality in common marmosets, other primates
and humans.

Drugs modulating the metabotropic glutamate type 2 receptor (mGluR2) activity may
have therapeutic benefits in treating a large spectrum of neuro-psychiatric
disorders, from schizophrenia to Parkinson's disease, both as a symptomatic
therapy and potential disease-modifying paradigm. LY-487,379 is a highly
selective mGluR2 positive allosteric modulator that is widely used to study
mGluR2 function using experimental animal models. The common marmoset is a small 
primate that has long been used in neuroscience. However, given its small size
and small circulating blood volume, conducting studies to determine the PK
profile of LY-487,379 is challenging. We developed and validated a sensitive and 
selective analytical method that enables quantification of LY-487,379 using a
limited volume of plasma (10 μL). The analytical method consists of protein
precipitation followed by high-performance liquid chromatography with heat
assisted electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HPLC-HESI-MS/MS). The
chromatographic separation was achieved using gradient elution with a mobile
phase consisting of acetonitrile and 0.01% formic acid in water on a Thermo
Scientific Aquasil C18 analytical column (100 × 2.1 mm I.D., 5 μm) operating at
40 °C and at a flow rate of 300 μL/min. The method displays a linear relationship
ranging from 0.2 to 100 ng/mL. Intra- and inter-day relative standard deviations 
are <1.4% and 7.9%, respectively and the relative error ranged from -6.9 to 9.7%.
The method was used to quantify LY-487,379 in both rat and marmoset plasma, and
PK parameters were determined after a single subcutaneous dose of 1.0 mg kg-1 in 
both species and significant differences in Cmax, AUC and T1/2 were observed.

Previous studies have shown that adult marmosets lack ocular dominance columns
(ODC) in area 17, but that ODCs can be demonstrated upon visual deprivation. The 
present results, obtained by transneuronal transport of WGA-HRP, indicate that
ODCs normally develop in juvenile marmosets but disappear before the animal
reaches maturity. The findings suggest that formation of ODCs during ontogenesis,
and their persistence through adulthood, are different developmental processes
depending on different mechanisms.

There is considerable evidence suggesting that endogenous opioid peptides (EOP)
might play a role in the defensive response to stressful stimuli. The stress
associated with receipt of aggression from a female conspecific and physical
restraint for collection of serial blood samples (at 10-min intervals) resulted
in a significant (p less than 0.05) suppression of LH secretion in the oestradiol
primed ovariectomized marmoset. Administration of the opioid receptor antagonist,
Naloxone (1 mg/kg) immediately before and after receipt of aggression completely 
prevented the stress-induced decrease in LH release. This suggests that EOP may
mediate, at least in part, this stress induced decline in LH release in the
marmoset.

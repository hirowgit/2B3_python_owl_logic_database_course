Adaptive evolution may be linked with the genomic distribution and function of
short tandem repeats (STRs). Proximity of the core promoter STRs to the +1
transcription start site (TSS), and their mutable nature are characteristics that
highlight those STRs as a novel source of interspecies variation. The PAXBP1 gene
(alternatively known as GCFC1) core promoter contains the longest STR identified 
in a Homo sapiens gene core promoter. Indeed, this core promoter is a stretch of 
four consecutive CT-STRs. In the current study, we used the Ensembl, NCBI, and
UCSC databases to analyze the evolutionary trend and functional implication of
this CT-STR complex in six major lineages across vertebrates, including primates,
non-primate mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fish. We observed
exceptional expansion (≥4-repeats) and conservation of this CT-STR complex across
primates, except prosimians, Microcebus murinus and Otolemur garnettii (Fisher
exact P<4.1×10(-7)). H. sapiens has the most complex STR formula, and longest
repeats. Macaca mulatta and Callithrix jacchus monkeys have the simplest STR
formulas, and shortest repeat numbers. CT≥4-repeats were not detected in
non-primate lineages. Different length alleles across the PAXBP1 core promoter
CT-STRs significantly altered gene expression in vitro (P<0.001, t-test). PAXBP1 
has a crucial role in craniofacial development, myogenesis, and spine
morphogenesis, properties that have been diverged between primates and
non-primates. To our knowledge, this is the first instance of expansion and
conservation of a STR complex co-occurring specifically with the primate lineage.

Compassionate caretaking behaviour towards dying adult group members has been
reported as being unique to humans and chimpanzees. Here we describe in detail
the reaction of a wild dominant male common marmoset, a neotropical primate, to
the accidental death of the dominant female of its group. The male exhibited
behaviours towards the dying female that resembled those of chimpanzees and
humans. The long-term relationship between the dominant pair (which lasted at
least 3.5 years) and their social status in the group may have contributed to the
male's behavioural response. The male prevented young individuals from
approaching the dying female, behaviour previously observed in chimpanzees. The
data provide an interesting insight into compassionate caretaking behaviours in
New World primates as well as the pair-bond systems of common marmosets. These
are rare observations, and thus their detailed descriptions are essential if we
are to create a comparative and enhanced understanding of human and nonhuman
primate thanatology.

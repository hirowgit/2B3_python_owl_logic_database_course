Sensory information travels along feedforward connections through a hierarchy of 
cortical areas, which, in turn, send feedback connections to lower-order areas.
Feedback has been implicated in attention, expectation, and sensory context, but 
the mechanisms underlying these diverse feedback functions are unknown. Using
specific optogenetic inactivation of feedback connections from the secondary
visual area (V2), we show how feedback affects neural responses in the primate
primary visual cortex (V1). Reducing feedback activity increases V1 cells'
receptive field (RF) size, decreases their responses to stimuli confined to the
RF, and increases their responses to stimuli extending into the proximal
surround, therefore reducing surround suppression. Moreover, stronger reduction
of V2 feedback activity leads to progressive increase in RF size and decrease in 
response amplitude, an effect predicted by a recurrent network model. Our results
indicate that feedback modulates RF size, surround suppression and response
amplitude, similar to the modulatory effects of visual spatial attention.

The high case-fatality rate of confirmed MERS-CoV infections underlines the
urgent need for an effective treatment to reduce the disease severity and
mortality. REGN3051 and REGN3048 are two fully human neutralizing monoclonal
antibodies (mAb) against MERS-CoV that reduced virus replication in mice
expressing human DPP4 upon prophylactic and therapeutic treatment. Here, we
evaluated the prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of REGN3048 and REGN3051 in
the common marmoset model of MERS-CoV infection. Intravenous administration of
mAb resulted in high levels of MERS-CoV-neutralizing activity in circulating
blood. When animals were treated with mAbs one day before challenge, respiratory 
disease was less severe and, in animals treated with both REGN3048 and REGN3051, 
viral loads in the lungs were reduced. However, therapeutic treatment on day one 
after challenge was less efficacious as it did not prevent the development of
severe respiratory disease and all treated animals developed bronchointerstitial 
pneumonia of similar severity as the control animals. Thus, mAb administration
may be more effective in a prophylactic treatment regimen rather than treatment
of MERS.

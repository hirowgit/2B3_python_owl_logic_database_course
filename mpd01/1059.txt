The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) has garnered interest recently as a
powerful model for the future of neuroscience research. Much of this excitement
has centered on the species' reproductive biology and compatibility with gene
editing techniques, which together have provided a path for transgenic marmosets 
to contribute to the study of disease as well as basic brain mechanisms. In step 
with technical advances is the need to establish experimental paradigms that
optimally tap into the marmosets' behavioral and cognitive capacities. While
conditioned task performance of a marmoset can compare unfavorably with rhesus
monkey performance on conventional testing paradigms, marmosets' social behavior 
and cognition are more similar to that of humans. For example, marmosets are
among only a handful of primates that, like humans, routinely pair bond and care 
cooperatively for their young. They are also notably pro-social and exhibit
social cognitive abilities, such as imitation, that are rare outside of the Apes.
In this Primer, we describe key facets of marmoset natural social behavior and
demonstrate that emerging behavioral paradigms are well suited to isolate
components of marmoset cognition that are highly relevant to humans. These
approaches generally embrace natural behavior, which has been rare in
conventional primate testing, and thus allow for a new consideration of neural
mechanisms underlying primate social cognition and signaling. We anticipate that 
through parallel technical and paradigmatic advances, marmosets will become an
essential model of human social behavior, including its dysfunction in
neuropsychiatric disorders.

The marmoset is an emerging animal model for large-scale attempts to understand
primate brain connectivity, but achieving this aim requires the development and
validation of procedures for normalization and integration of results from many
neuroanatomical experiments. Here we describe a computational pipeline for
coregistration of retrograde tracing data on connections of cortical areas into a
3D marmoset brain template, generated from Nissl-stained sections. The procedure 
results in a series of spatial transformations that are applied to the
coordinates of labeled neurons in the different cases, bringing them into common 
stereotaxic space. We applied this procedure to 17 injections, placed in the
frontal lobe of nine marmosets as part of earlier studies. Visualizations of
cortical patterns of connections revealed by these injections are supplied as
Supplementary Materials. Comparison between the results of the automated and
human-based processing of these cases reveals that the centers of injection sites
can be reconstructed, on average, to within 0.6 mm of coordinates estimated by an
experienced neuroanatomist. Moreover, cell counts obtained in different areas by 
the automated approach are highly correlated (r = 0.83) with those obtained by an
expert, who examined in detail histological sections for each individual. The
present procedure enables comparison and visualization of large datasets, which
in turn opens the way for integration and analysis of results from many animals. 
Its versatility, including applicability to archival materials, may reduce the
number of additional experiments required to produce the first detailed cortical 
connectome of a primate brain. J. Comp. Neurol. 524:2161-2181, 2016. © 2016 The

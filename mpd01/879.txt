Common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) have attracted increasing attention as a
useful small non-human primate model in preclinical research. However, studies on
marmoset cytochrome P450 (P450) 2E enzyme have scarcely been conducted. In this
study, the full-length cDNA encoding P450 2E1 enzyme was isolated from marmoset
livers by reverse transcription (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Marmoset
P450 2E1 amino acid sequences were highly identical (>88%) to those of cynomolgus
monkey and human P450 2E1 enzymes. Phylogenetic analysis indicated a close
evolutionary relationship among marmoset, cynomolgus monkey, and human P450 2E1
enzymes. The tissue expression pattern analyzed by real-time RT-PCR and
immunoblotting demonstrated that marmoset P450 2E1 mRNA and proteins were
predominantly expressed in livers. Marmoset P450 2E1 enzyme heterologously
expressed in Escherichia coli catalyzed the hydroxylation of p-nitrophenol,
chlorzoxazone, and theophylline, similar to cynomolgus monkey and human P450 2E1 
enzymes. By kinetic analyses, those P450 2E1 enzymes catalyzed p-nitrophenol
hydroxylation with similar affinities and relatively high intrinsic clearance
efficiencies. These results indicated that tissue distribution and
enzyme-substrate specificity of marmoset P450 2E1 were similar to cynomolgus
monkey and human P450 2E1 enzymes, suggesting that marmosets are a suitable
primate model for P450 2E1-dependent drug and xenobiotic metabolism.

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection in humans is
highly lethal, with a fatality rate of 35%. New prophylactic and therapeutic
strategies to combat human infections are urgently needed. We isolated a fully
human neutralizing antibody, MCA1, from a human survivor. The antibody recognizes
the receptor-binding domain of MERS-CoV S glycoprotein and interferes with the
interaction between viral S and the human cellular receptor human dipeptidyl
peptidase 4 (DPP4). To our knowledge, this study is the first to report a human
neutralizing monoclonal antibody that completely inhibits MERS-CoV replication in
common marmosets. Monotherapy with MCA1 represents a potential alternative
treatment for human infections with MERS-CoV worthy of evaluation in clinical
settings.

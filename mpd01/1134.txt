High-resolution metabolomics has created opportunity to integrate nutrition and
metabolism into genetic studies to improve understanding of the diverse radiation
of primate species. At present, however, there is very little information to help
guide experimental design for study of wild populations. In a previous
non-targeted metabolomics study of common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus), Rhesus 
macaques, humans, and four non-primate mammalian species, we found that essential
amino acids (AA) and other central metabolites had interspecies variation similar
to intraspecies variation while non-essential AA, environmental chemicals and
catabolic waste products had greater interspecies variation. The present study
was designed to test whether 55 plasma metabolites, including both nutritionally 
essential and non-essential metabolites and catabolic products, differ in
concentration in common marmosets and humans. Significant differences were
present for more than half of the metabolites analyzed and included AA, vitamins 
and central lipid metabolites, as well as for catabolic products of AA,
nucleotides, energy metabolism and heme. Three environmental chemicals were
present at low nanomolar concentrations but did not differ between species. Sex
and age differences in marmosets were present for AA and nucleotide metabolism
and warrant additional study. Overall, the results suggest that quantitative,
targeted metabolomics can provide a useful complement to non-targeted
metabolomics for studies of diet and environment interactions in primate
evolution.

Zoonotic pathogens that cause leprosy (Mycobacterium leprae) and tuberculosis
(Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, MTBC) continue to impact modern human
populations. Therefore, methods able to survey mycobacterial infection in
potential animal hosts are necessary for proper evaluation of human exposure
threats. Here we tested for mycobacterial-specific single- and multi-copy loci
using qPCR. In a trial study in which armadillos were artificially infected with 
M. leprae, these techniques were specific and sensitive to pathogen detection,
while more traditional ELISAs were only specific. These assays were then employed
in a case study to detect M. leprae as well as MTBC in wild marmosets. All
marmosets were negative for M. leprae DNA, but 14 were positive for the
mycobacterial rpoB gene assay. Targeted capture and sequencing of rpoB and other 
MTBC genes validated the presence of mycobacterial DNA in these samples and
revealed that qPCR is useful for identifying mycobacterial-infected animal hosts.

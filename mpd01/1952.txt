Advanced magnetic resonance (MR) neuroimaging analysis techniques based on
voxel-wise statistics, such as voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and functional MRI, 
are widely applied to cognitive brain research in both human subjects and in
non-human primates. Recent developments in imaging have enabled the evaluation of
smaller animal models with sufficient spatial resolution. The common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus), a small New World primate species, has been widely used in 
neuroscience research, to which voxel-wise statistics could be extended with a
species-specific brain template. Here, we report, for the first time, a
tissue-segmented, population-averaged standard template of the common marmoset
brain. This template was created by using anatomical T(1)-weighted images from 22
adult marmosets with a high-resolution isotropic voxel size of (0.2 mm)(3) at
7-Tesla and DARTEL algorithm in SPM8. Whole brain templates are available at
International Neuroinformatics Japan Node website,

BACKGROUND: Common marmoset monkeys (Callithrix jacchus) are readily used in
biomedical research. However, superovulation for embryonic stem cell production
and developmental research still remain difficult. Inexplicably,
follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) as key player in superovulation has to be
administered in extremely high dosages in this non-human primate compared to
human.
METHODS: To evaluate whether marmoset FSH (cjFSH) is functionally more competent 
than its human homologue on the marmoset FSH receptor (cjFSHR), we established in
vitro a homologous system characterizing homologous and recombinantly produced
cjFSH.
RESULTS: Upon stimulation of two cell lines stably expressing either the marmoset
or the human FSH receptor (cj/hFSHR), respectively, the second messenger
signaling of the activated receptor displayed no significant difference in ED(50)
values. Thermostability of cjFSH was significantly prolonged by roughly 20% on
both FSHRs.
CONCLUSION: High FSH dosage in marmoset superovulation cannot be explained by
enhanced biopotency of the natural animal's gonadotropin.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) has attracted considerable attention,
especially in the biomedical science and neuroscience research fields, because of
its potential to recapitulate the complex and multidimensional phenotypes of
human diseases, and several neurodegenerative transgenic models have been
reported. However, there remain several issues as (i) it takes years to generate 
late-onset disease models, and (ii) the onset age and severity of phenotypes can 
vary among individuals due to differences in genetic background. In the present
study, we established an efficient and rapid direct neuronal induction method
(induced neurons; iNs) from embryonic and adult marmoset fibroblasts to
investigate cellular-level phenotypes in the marmoset brain in vitro. We
overexpressed reprogramming effectors, i.e., microRNA-9/9*, microRNA-124, and
Achaete-Scute family bHLH transcription factor 1, in fibroblasts with a small
molecule cocktail that facilitates neuronal induction. The resultant iNs from
embryonic and adult marmoset fibroblasts showed neuronal characteristics within
two weeks, including neuron-specific gene expression and spontaneous neuronal
activity. As directly reprogrammed neurons have been shown to model
neurodegenerative disorders, the neuronal reprogramming of marmoset fibroblasts
may offer new tools for investigating neurological phenotypes associated with
disease progression in non-human primate neurological disease models.

Saccades are stereotypic behaviors whose investigation improves our understanding
of how primate brains implement precise motor control. Furthermore, saccades
offer an important window into the cognitive and attentional state of the brain. 
Historically, saccade studies have largely relied on macaques. However, the
cortical network giving rise to the saccadic command is difficult to study in
macaques because relevant cortical areas lie in deep sulci and are difficult to
access. Recently, a New World monkey. the marmoset, has garnered attention as an 
alternative to macaques because of advantages including its smooth cortical
surface. However, adoption of the marmoset for oculomotor research has been
limited due to a lack of in-depth descriptions of marmoset saccade kinematics and
their ability to perform psychophysical tasks. Here, we directly compare
free-viewing and visually guided behavior of marmoset, macaque, and human engaged
in identical tasks under similar conditions. In the video free-viewing task, all 
species exhibited qualitatively similar saccade kinematics up to 25Â° in amplitude
although with different parameters. Furthermore, the conventional bottom-up
saliency model predicted gaze targets at similar rates for all species. We
further verified their visually guided behavior by training them with step and
gap saccade tasks. In the step paradigm, marmosets did not show shorter saccade
reaction time for upward saccades whereas macaques and humans did. In the gap
paradigm, all species showed similar gap effect and express saccades. Our results
suggest that the marmoset can serve as a model for oculomotor, attentional, and
cognitive research while we need to be aware of their difference from macaque or 
human.NEW & NOTEWORTHY We directly compared the results of a video free-viewing
task and visually guided saccade tasks (step and gap) among three different
species: marmoset, macaque, and human. We found that all species exhibit
qualitatively similar saccadic kinematics and saliency-driven saccadic behavior
albeit with different parameters. Our results suggest that the marmoset possesses
similar neural mechanisms to macaque and human for saccadic control, and it is an
appropriate model to study neural mechanisms for active vision and attention.

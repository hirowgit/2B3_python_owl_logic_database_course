The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) has garnered interest recently as a
powerful model for the future of neuroscience research. Much of this excitement
has centered on the species' reproductive biology and compatibility with gene
editing techniques, which together have provided a path for transgenic marmosets 
to contribute to the study of disease as well as basic brain mechanisms. In step 
with technical advances is the need to establish experimental paradigms that
optimally tap into the marmosets' behavioral and cognitive capacities. While
conditioned task performance of a marmoset can compare unfavorably with rhesus
monkey performance on conventional testing paradigms, marmosets' social behavior 
and cognition are more similar to that of humans. For example, marmosets are
among only a handful of primates that, like humans, routinely pair bond and care 
cooperatively for their young. They are also notably pro-social and exhibit
social cognitive abilities, such as imitation, that are rare outside of the Apes.
In this Primer, we describe key facets of marmoset natural social behavior and
demonstrate that emerging behavioral paradigms are well suited to isolate
components of marmoset cognition that are highly relevant to humans. These
approaches generally embrace natural behavior, which has been rare in
conventional primate testing, and thus allow for a new consideration of neural
mechanisms underlying primate social cognition and signaling. We anticipate that 
through parallel technical and paradigmatic advances, marmosets will become an
essential model of human social behavior, including its dysfunction in
neuropsychiatric disorders.

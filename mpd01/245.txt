Intracellular neuronal recordings from the brain of awake nonhuman primates have 
remained difficult to obtain because of several formidable technical challenges, 
such as poor recording stability and difficulties in maintaining long-term
recording conditions. We have developed a technique to record neuronal activity
by using a coaxial guide tube and sharp electrode assembly, which allows
researchers to repeatedly and reliably perform intracellular recordings in the
cortex of awake marmosets. Recordings from individual neurons last from several
minutes to more than an hour. A key advantage of this approach is that it does
not require dura removal, permitting recordings over weeks and months in a single
animal. This protocol describes the step-by-step procedures for construction of a
custom-made marmoset chair, head-cap implantation, preparation of the sharp
electrode and guide tube, neuronal recording and data analysis. As the technique 
is practical and easy to adapt, we anticipate that it can also be applied to
other mammalian models, including larger-size nonhuman primates.

Sphingolipids and enzymes of the sphingolipid rheostat determine synaptic
appearance and signaling in the brain, but sphingolipid contribution to normal
behavioral plasticity is little understood. Here we asked how the sphingolipid
rheostat contributes to learning and memory of various dimensions. We
investigated the role of these lipids in the mechanisms of two different types of
memory, such as appetitively and aversively motivated memory, which are
considered to be mediated by different neural mechanisms. We found an association
between superior performance in short- and long-term appetitively motivated
learning and regionally enhanced neutral sphingomyelinase (NSM) activity. An
opposite interaction was observed in an aversively motivated task. A
valence-dissociating role of NSM in learning was confirmed in mice with
genetically reduced NSM activity. This role may be mediated by the NSM control of
N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor subunit expression. In a translational approach, we
confirmed a positive association of serum NSM activity with long-term
appetitively motivated memory in nonhuman primates and in healthy humans.
Altogether, these data suggest a new sphingolipid mechanism of de-novo learning
and memory, which is based on NSM activity.

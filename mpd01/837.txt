As the optogenetic field expands, the need for precise targeting of neocortical
circuits only grows more crucial. This work demonstrates a technique for using
Solidworks® computer-aided design (CAD) and readily available stereotactic brain 
atlases to create a three-dimensional (3-D) model of the dorsal region of area
visual cortex 4 (V4D) of the macaque monkey (Macaca fascicularis) visual cortex. 
The 3-D CAD model of the brain was used to customize an [Formula: see text] Utah 
optrode array (UOA) after it was determined that a high-density ([Formula: see
text]) UOA caused extensive damage to marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) primary
visual cortex as assessed by electrophysiological recording of spiking activity
through a 1.5-mm-diameter through glass via. The [Formula: see text] UOA was
customized for optrode length ([Formula: see text]), optrode width ([Formula: see
text]), optrode pitch ([Formula: see text]), backplane thickness ([Formula: see
text]), and overall form factor ([Formula: see text]). Two [Formula: see text]
UOAs were inserted into layer VI of macaque V4D cortices with minimal damage as
assessed in fixed tissue cytochrome oxidase staining in nonrecoverable surgeries.
Additionally, two [Formula: see text] arrays were implanted in mice (Mus
musculus) motor cortices, providing early evidence for long-term tolerability
(over 6 months), and for the ability to integrate the UOA with a Holobundle light
delivery system toward patterned optogenetic stimulation of cortical networks.

The common marmoset has recently gained a great deal of attention as an
experimental primate model for biological science and medical research. To use
the common marmoset for development of novel treatments and rehabilitation for
locomotor disorders, it is crucial to understand fundamental baseline
characteristics of locomotion in this species. Therefore, in the present study we
performed kinematic and kinetic analyses of quadrupedal locomotion in this
animal. A total of 14 common marmosets walking quadrupedally along a walkway were
analyzed using synchronized high-speed cameras, with two force platforms set in
the walkway. Our results demonstrated that the marmoset uses a lateral sequence
walking pattern, in contrast to the macaque and other primates, which usually
adopt a diagonal sequence pattern. Furthermore, peak vertical ground reaction
force on the forelimb was larger than that on the hindlimb. The rate of energy
recovery for quadrupedal walking in the common marmoset was much smaller than
that in the macaque, indicating that the marmoset generally utilizes bouncing
mechanics in locomotion, even though the duty factor is >0.5. This description of
locomotor characteristics of intact marmosets may serve as a basis for
comparative analyses of changes in gait due to rehabilitation and regenerative
treatments.

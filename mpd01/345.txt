Any transmission of vocal signals faces the challenge of acoustic interferences
such as heavy rain, wind, animal or urban sounds. Consequently, several
mechanisms and strategies have evolved to optimize signal-to-noise ratio.
Examples to increase detectability are the Lombard effect, an involuntary rise in
call amplitude in response to masking ambient noise, which is often associated
with other vocal changes such as call frequency and duration, as well as the
animals' capability of limiting calling to periods where noise perturbation is
absent. Previous studies revealed vocal flexibility and various audio-vocal
integration mechanisms in marmoset monkeys. Using acoustic perturbation triggered
by vocal behaviour, we investigated whether marmosets are capable of exhibiting
changes in call structure when perturbing noise starts after call onset or
whether such effects only occur if noise perturbation starts prior to call onset.
We show that marmosets are capable of rapidly modulating call amplitude and
frequency in response to such noise perturbation. Vocalizations swiftly increased
call frequency after noise onset indicating a rapid effect of perturbing noise on
vocal motor production. Call amplitudes were also affected. Interestingly,
however, the marmosets did not exhibit the Lombard effect as previously reported 
but decreased call intensity in response to noise. Our findings indicate that
marmosets possess a general avoidance strategy to call in the presence of ambient
noise and suggest that these animals are capable of counteracting a previously
thought involuntary audio-vocal mechanism, the Lombard effect. These findings
will pave the way to investigate the underlying audio-vocal integration
mechanisms explaining these behaviours.

BLIMP1 (PRDM1) and VASA (DDX4) play pivotal roles in the development of the germ 
cell linage. Importantly, these genes are specifically expressed in germ cells;
BLIMP1 in primordial germ cells (PGCs) to early-stage gonocytes, and VASA in
migration-stage PGCs to mature gametes. The high reproductive efficiency of
common marmosets (marmosets; Callithrix jacchus) makes them advantageous for use 
in germ cell research. We herein report the generation of a male marmoset
embryonic stem cell (ESC) line harboring BLIMP1 and DDX4 double reporters. This
ESC line will be a useful tool for investigating male gametogenesis in non-human 
primates.

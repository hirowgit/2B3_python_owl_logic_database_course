We studied the functional connectivity of cells in the lateral geniculate nucleus
(LGN) with the primary visual cortex (V1) in anesthetized marmosets (Callithrix
jacchus). The LGN sends signals to V1 along parallel visual pathways called
parvocellular (P), magnocellular (M), and koniocellular (K). To better understand
how these pathways provide inputs to V1, we antidromically activated relay cells 
in the LGN by electrically stimulating V1 and measuring the conduction latencies 
of P (n = 7), M (n = 14), and the "Blue-ON" (n = 5) subgroup of K cells (K-BON
cells). We found that the antidromic latencies of K-BON cells were similar to
those of P cells. We also measured the response latencies to high contrast visual
stimuli for a subset of cells. We found the LGN cells that have the shortest
latency of response to visual stimulation also have the shortest antidromic
latencies. We conclude that Blue color signals are transmitted directly to V1
from the LGN by K-BON cells.

Depleting mAbs against the pan B cell marker CD20 are remarkably effective in the
treatment of autoimmune-mediated inflammatory disorders, but the underlying
mechanisms are poorly defined. The primary objective of this study was to find a 
mechanistic explanation for the remarkable clinical effect of the anti-CD20 mAbs 
in a representative nonhuman primate autoimmune-mediated inflammatory disorder
model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in common marmosets,
allowing detailed analysis of secondary lymphoid organs (SLO). We observed that
the depletion of CD20(+) B cells creates a less immunostimulatory environment in 
the SLO reflected by reduced expression of MHC class II, CD40, CD83, and
CD80/CD86. APCs isolated from SLO of B cell-depleted EAE monkeys were also less
responsive to mitogenic stimulation. The depleted B cell areas were replenished
by T cells, of which the majority expressed CD127 (IL-7R) and CCR7. Such effects 
were not detected in EAE marmosets treated with mAb against BLyS or APRIL, where 
B cell depletion via withdrawal of essential survival cytokines was not
associated with a marked clinical effect. We propose that at least part of the
efficacy of anti-CD20 mAb therapy is attributable to the sustained CCR7
expression on T cells within SLO, limiting their release into the circulation.

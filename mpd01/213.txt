The standard anatomical brain template provides a common space and coordinate
system for visualizing and analyzing neuroimaging data from large cohorts of
subjects. Previous templates and atlases for the common marmoset brain were
either based on data from a single individual or lacked essential functionalities
for neuroimaging analysis. Here, we present new population-based in-vivo standard
templates and tools derived from multi-modal data of 27 marmosets, including
multiple types of T1w and T2w contrast images, DTI contrasts, and large
field-of-view MRI and CT images. We performed multi-atlas labeling of anatomical 
structures on the new templates and constructed highly accurate tissue-type
segmentation maps to facilitate volumetric studies. We built fully featured brain
surfaces and cortical flat maps to facilitate 3D visualization and surface-based 
analyses, which are compatible with most surface analyzing tools, including
FreeSurfer, AFNI/SUMA, and the Connectome Workbench. Analysis of the MRI and CT
datasets revealed significant variations in brain shapes, sizes, and regional
volumes of brain structures, highlighting substantial individual variabilities in
the marmoset population. Thus, our population-based template and associated tools
provide a versatile analysis platform and standard coordinate system for a wide
range of MRI and connectome studies of common marmosets. These new template tools
comprise version 3 of our Marmoset Brain Mapping Project and are publicly
available via marmosetbrainmapping.org/v3.html.

The rapid adoption of marmosets in neuroscience has created a demand for three
dimensional (3D) atlases of the brain of this species to facilitate data
integration in a common reference space. We report on a new open access template 
of the marmoset cortex (the Nencki-Monash, or NM template), representing a
morphological average of 20 brains of young adult individuals, obtained by 3D
reconstructions generated from Nissl-stained serial sections. The method used to 
generate the template takes into account morphological features of the individual
brains, as well as the borders of clearly defined cytoarchitectural areas. This
has resulted in a resource which allows direct estimates of the most likely
coordinates of each cortical area, as well as quantification of the margins
of error involved in assigning voxels to areas, and preserves quantitative
information about the laminar structure of the cortex. We provide spatial
transformations between the NM and other available marmoset brain templates, thus
enabling integration with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and tracer-based
connectivity data. The NM template combines some of the main advantages of
histology-based atlases (e.g. information about the cytoarchitectural structure) 
with features more commonly associated with MRI-based templates (isotropic nature
of the dataset, and probabilistic analyses). The underlying workflow may be found
useful in the future development of 3D brain atlases that incorporate information
about the variability of areas in species for which it may be impractical to
ensure homogeneity of the sample in terms of age, sex and genetic background.

The use of the hand of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus Erxleben, 1777)
was analysed on the basis of observations and experiments conducted on 56 animals
of all age. During arboreal locomotion Callithrix jacchus makes use of the hands 
for support and for grasping to maintain its balance, The palmar region serves as
the main means of support, while the findgers in the locomotor grip also
contribute to maintaining balance and support. The greater the need for
maintaining balance, for example, during vertikal climbing or in movement along
the narow branches, the mre complete the djustment of the hand form on the
surface and the more complete the alignment of the hand on the branch will be.
Additional support is supplied by the longitudinal palm furrow, caused by the
radio-ulnar adduction of the hand edges and by the clinging properties of the
volar pads...

BACKGROUND: A vaccine against all four dengue virus (DENV) serotypes includes the
formulation of one genotype of each serotype. Although genetic similarities among
genotypes within a serotype are higher as compared to those among serotypes,
differences in the immunogenicity of the included genotypes would be a critical
issue in maximizing successful dengue vaccine development. Thus, we determined
the neutralizing antibody responses against three genotypes of dengue virus
serotype 2 (DENV-2), namely Cosmopolitan, Asian I, and Asian/American, after
primary and secondary inoculation with DENV-2 in a dengue animal model, the
common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).
METHODS: A total of fifty-four plasma samples were obtained from thirty-four
marmosets that were inoculated with clinically-isolated DENV strains or DENV
candidate vaccines, were used in this study. Plasma samples were obtained from
marmosets after primary inoculation with DENV-2 infection, secondary inoculation 
with homologous or heterologous genotypes, and tertiary inoculation with
heterologous DENV. Neutralizing antibody titers against DENV-2 (Cosmopolitan,
Asian I, and Asian/American genotypes) and DENV-1 were determined using a
conventional plaque reduction neutralization assay.
RESULTS: In marmosets that were inoculated with the Cosmopolitan genotype in
primary infection, neutralizing antibody neutralized 3 genotypes, and the titers 
to Asian I genotype were significantly higher than those to homologous
Cosmopolitan genotype. After secondary DENV-2 infection with heterologous
genotype (Asian I in primary and Asian/American in secondary), neutralizing
antibody titers to Asian/American genotype was significantly higher than those
against Cosmopolitan and Asian I genotypes. Following tertiary infection with
DENV-1 following DENV-2 Asian I and Cosmopolitan genotypes, neutralizing antibody
titers to Asian/American were also significantly higher than those against
Cosmopolitan and Asian I genotypes.
CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrated that different levels of neutralizing 
antibodies were induced against variable DENV-2 genotypes after primary,
secondary and tertiary infections, and that neutralizing antibody titers to some 
heterologous genotypes were higher than those to homologous genotypes within a
serotype. The results indicate that heterogeneity and homogeneity of infecting
genotypes influence the levels and cross-reactivity of neutralizing antibodies
induced in following infections. The results also suggest that certain genotypes 
may possess advantage in terms of breakthrough infections against vaccination.

A key question for understanding speech evolution is whether or not the
vocalizations of our closest living relatives-nonhuman primates-represent the
precursors to speech. Some believe that primate vocalizations are not volitional 
but are instead inextricably linked to internal states like arousal and thus bear
little resemblance to human speech. Others disagree and believe that since many
primates can use their vocalizations strategically, this demonstrates a degree of
voluntary vocal control. In the current study, we present a behavioral paradigm
that reliably elicits different types of affiliative vocalizations from marmoset 
monkeys while measuring their heart rate fluctuations using noninvasive
electromyography. By modulating both the physical distance between marmosets and 
the sensory information available to them, we find that arousal levels are
linked, but not inextricably, to vocal production. Different arousal levels are, 
generally, associated with changes in vocal acoustics and the drive to produce
different call types. However, in contexts where marmosets are interacting, the
production of these different call types is also affected by extrinsic factors
such as the timing of a conspecific's vocalization. These findings suggest that
variability in vocal output as a function of context might reflect trade-offs
between the drive to perpetuate vocal contact and conserving energy.

Auditory-vocal interaction, the modulation of auditory sensory responses during
vocal production, is an important but poorly understood neurophysiological
phenomenon in nonhuman primates. This sensory-motor processing has important
behavioral implications for self-monitoring during vocal production as well as
feedback-mediated vocal control for both animals and humans. Previous studies in 
marmosets have shown that a large portion of neurons in the auditory cortex are
suppressed during self-produced vocalization but have primarily focused on a
single type of isolation vocalization. The present study expands previous
analyses to compare auditory-vocal interaction of cortical responses between
different types of vocalizations. We recorded neurons from the auditory cortex of
unrestrained marmoset monkeys with implanted electrode arrays and showed that
auditory-vocal interactions generalize across vocalization types. We found the
following: 1) Vocal suppression and excitation are a general phenomenon,
occurring for all four major vocalization types. 2) Within individual neurons,
suppression was the more general response, occurring for multiple vocalization
types, while excitation tended to be more specific to a single vocalization type.
3) A subset of neurons changed their responses between different types of
vocalization, most often from strong suppression or excitation for one
vocalization to unresponsive for another, and only rarely from suppression to
excitation. 4) Differences in neural responses between vocalization types were
weakly correlated with passive response properties, measured by playbacks of
acoustic stimuli including recorded vocalizations. These results indicate that
vocalization-induced modulation of the auditory cortex is a general phenomenon
applicable to all vocalization types, but variations within individual neurons
suggest possible vocalization-specific coding.

Common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) developed high levels of viremia, clinical 
signs including fever, weight loss, a decrease in activity and hematuria upon
inoculation with dengue virus (DENV). Presence of DENV genome in urine samples
and pathological changes in kidneys were examined in the present study. Levels of
DENV genome were determined in 228 urine samples from 20 primary DENV-inoculated 
marmosets and in 56 urine samples from four secondary DENV-inoculated marmosets. 
DENV genome was detected in 75% (15/20) of marmosets after primary DENV
infection. No DENV genome was detected in urine samples from the marmosets with
secondary infection with homologous DENV (0%, 0/4). Two marmosets demonstrated
hematuria. Pathological analysis of the kidneys demonstrated non-suppressive
interstitial nephritis with renal tubular regeneration. DENV antigen-positive
cells were detected in kidneys. In human dengue virus infections, some patients
present renal symptoms. The results indicate that marmosets recapitulate some
aspects of the involvement of kidneys in human DENV infection, and suggest that
marmosets are potentially useful for the studies of the pathogenesis of DENV
infection, including kidneys.

In the vertebrate retina, amacrine and ganglion cells represent the most diverse 
cell classes. They can be classified into different cell types by several
features, such as morphology, light responses, and gene expression profile.
Although birds possess high visual acuity (similar to primates that we used here 
for comparison) and tetrachromatic color vision, data on the expression of
transcription factors in retinal ganglion cells of birds are largely missing. In 
this study, we tested various transcription factors, known to label
subpopulations of cells in mammalian retinae, in two avian species: the common
buzzard (Buteo buteo), a raptor with exceptional acuity, and the domestic pigeon 
(Columba livia domestica), a good navigator and widely used model for visual
cognition. Staining for the transcription factors Foxp2, Satb1 and Satb2 labeled 
most ganglion cells in the avian ganglion cell layer. CtBP2 was established as
marker for displaced amacrine cells, which allowed us to reliably distinguish
ganglion cells from displaced amacrine cells and assess their densities in
buzzard and pigeon. When we additionally compared the temporal and central fovea 
of the buzzard with the fovea of primates, we found that the cellular
organization in the pits was different in primates and raptors. In summary, we
demonstrate that the expression of transcription factors is a defining feature of
cell types not only in the retina of mammals but also in the retina of birds. The
markers, which we have established, may provide useful tools for more detailed
studies on the retinal circuitry of these highly visual animals.

GAP-43 is a vertebrate neuron-specific protein and that is strongly related to
axon growth and regeneration; thus, this protein has been utilized as a classical
molecular marker of these events and growth cones. Although GAP-43 was
biochemically characterized more than a quarter century ago, how this protein is 
related to these events is still not clear. Recently, we identified many
phosphorylation sites in the growth cone membrane proteins of rodent brains. Two 
phosphorylation sites of GAP-43, S96 and T172, were found within the top 10 hit
sites among all proteins. S96 has already been characterized (Kawasaki et al.,
2018), and here, phosphorylation of T172 was characterized. In vitro (cultured
neurons) and in vivo, an antibody specific to phosphorylated T172 (pT172
antibody) specifically recognized cultured growth cones and growing axons in
developing mouse neurons, respectively. Immunoblotting showed that pT172 antigens
were more rapidly downregulated throughout development than those of pS96
antibody. From the primary structure, this phosphorylation site was predicted to 
be conserved in a wide range of animals including primates. In the developing
marmoset brainstem and in differentiated neurons derived from human induced
pluripotent stem cells, immunoreactivity with pT172 antibody revealed patterns
similar to those in mice. pT172 antibody also labeled regenerating axons
following sciatic nerve injury. Taken together, the T172 residue is widely
conserved in a wide range of mammals including primates, and pT172 is a new
candidate molecular marker for growing axons.

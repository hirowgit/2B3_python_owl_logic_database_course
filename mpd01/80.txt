Dyskinesia and psychosis are complications encountered in advanced Parkinson's
disease (PD) following long-term therapy with L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine
(L-DOPA). Disturbances in the glutamatergic system have been associated with both
dyskinesia and psychosis, making glutamatergic modulation a potential therapeutic
approach for these. Treatments thus far have sought to dampen glutamatergic
transmission, for example through blockade of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)
receptors or modulation of metabotropic glutamate receptors 5. In contrast,
activation of the glycine-binding site on NMDA receptors is required for their
physiological response. Here, we investigated whether indirectly enhancing
glutamatergic transmission through inhibition of glycine re-uptake would be
efficacious in diminishing both dyskinesia and psychosis-like behaviours (PLBs)
in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-lesioned common
marmoset. Six marmosets were rendered parkinsonian by MPTP injection. Following
repeated administration of L-DOPA to induce dyskinesia and PLBs, they underwent
acute challenges of the glycine transporter 1 (GlyT1) inhibitor ALX-5407 (0.01,
0.1 and 1 mg/kg) or vehicle, in combination with L-DOPA, after which the severity
of dyskinesia, PLBs and parkinsonian disability was evaluated. In combination
with L-DOPA, ALX-5407 0.1 and 1 mg/kg significantly reduced the severity of
dyskinesia, by 51% and 41% (both P < 0.001), when compared to vehicle. ALX-5407
0.01, 0.1 and 1 mg/kg also decreased the severity of global PLBs, by 25%, 51% and
38% (all P < 0.001), when compared to vehicle. The benefits on dyskinesia and
PLBs were achieved without compromising the therapeutic effect of L-DOPA on
parkinsonism. Our results suggest that GlyT1 inhibition may be a novel strategy
to attenuate dyskinesia and PLBs in PD, without interfering with L-DOPA
anti-parkinsonian action.

Animal welfare is critical to buffer stress in captive animals and to ensure the 
reliability of data from studies. The most usual environmental enrichment
technique (EE) for social non-human primates is the social enrichment. However,
some experimental protocols require keeping individuals isolated, thus demanding 
other types of EE. We tested in six adult Callithrix jacchus females, single
housed for experimental purpose, the stress buffering efficacy of a structural
enrichment protocol (SEP) and SEP in combination with a foraging enrichment
(FSEP) using  fecal cortisol and behaviors to infer stress levels. Both types of 
EE improved welfare in different ways, while cortisol levels decreased with both 
EE as compared to the baseline, autogrooming, and piloerection increased after
FSEP probably due to the new foods. Therefore, these findings support alternative
practices of EE when social animals are living in isolation and reinforce the
positive role of structural and food enrichment for decreasing stress markers. It
also encourages studies on welfare with females, since its use as an animal model
has increased.

Common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is an attractive animal model primate
species for potential use in drug metabolism and pharmacokinetic studies. In this
study, marmoset cytochrome P450 (P450) 2S1, 4V2, 7A1, 7B1, 8B1, 24A1, 26A1, 26C1,
27A1, 39A1, and 51A1 cDNAs were isolated from marmoset tissues (brains, lungs,
livers, kidneys, and jejunums). Deduced amino acid sequences (89-98% homologous) 
of the marmoset P450 gene suggested similarity of molecular characteristics of
marmoset P450s to human counterparts, compared with those of pig, rabbit, and
rodents. Phylogenetic analysis using amino acid sequences indicated 11 marmoset
P450 forms clustered with those of human and other primate counterparts,
suggesting marmoset P450s have an evolutionary close relationship to human and
other primate counterparts. Tissue expression patterns of these P450 mRNAs except
for P450 7B1 mRNA were generally similar to those of human P450s in the five
tissue types analyzed. These results suggest similarity of molecular
characteristics for P450 2S1, 4V2, 7A1, 7B1, 8B1, 24A1, 26A1, 26C1, 27A1, 39A1,
and 51A1 between marmosets and humans, in addition to the orthologs of human P450
1, 2, 3, and 4 families previously identified and characterized in marmosets.

Through enabling an efficient supply of cells and tissues in the health sector on
demand, cryopreservation is increasingly becoming one of the mainstream
technologies in rapid translation and commercialization of regenerative medicine 
research. Cryopreservation of tissue-engineered constructs (TECs) is an emerging 
trend that requires the development of practically competitive biobanking
technologies. In our previous studies, we demonstrated that conventional
slow-freezing using dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) does not provide sufficient
protection of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) frozen in 3D
collagen-hydroxyapatite scaffolds. After simple modifications to a
cryopreservation protocol, we report on significantly improved cryopreservation
of TECs. Porous 3D scaffolds were fabricated using freeze-drying of a mineralized
collagen suspension and following chemical crosslinking. Amnion-derived MSCs from
common marmoset monkey Callithrix jacchus were seeded onto scaffolds in static
conditions. Cell-seeded scaffolds were subjected to 24 h pre-treatment with
100 mM sucrose and slow freezing in 10% Me2SO/20% FBS alone or supplemented with 
300 mM sucrose. Scaffolds were frozen 'in air' and thawed using a two-step
procedure. Diverse analytical methods were used for the interpretation of
cryopreservation outcome for both cell-seeded and cell-free scaffolds. In both
groups, cells exhibited their typical shape and well-preserved cell-cell and
cell-matrix contacts after thawing. Moreover, viability test 24 h post-thaw
demonstrated that application of sucrose in the cryoprotective solution preserves
a significantly greater portion of sucrose-pretreated cells (more than 80%) in
comparison to Me2SO alone (60%). No differences in overall protein structure and 
porosity of frozen scaffolds were revealed whereas their compressive stress was
lower than in the control group. In conclusion, this approach holds promise for
the cryopreservation of 'ready-to-use' TECs.

BACKGROUND: Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a rare progressive
neurodegenerative encephalitis caused by some variants of measles virus (MV). The
structure of SSPE virus in the brains of SSPE patients is different from that of 
MV. The difference in interferon (IFN) production between cells infected with
SSPE virus and those infected with MV remains unclear.
METHODS: We measured the concentrations of IFN-α, β, γ, and λ1 (interleukin
(IL)-29) from MV- or SSPE virus-infected B95a cells (a marmoset B-lymphoblastoid 
cell line).
RESULTS: SSPE virus-infected B95a cells produced significantly higher levels of
IFN-α and λ1 than did MV-infected or mock-infected cells.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that SSPE virus and MV induce different IFN
production profiles.

Ebolavirus and Marburgvirus are members of the filovirus family and induce a
fatal hemorrhagic disease in humans and nonhuman primates with 90% case fatality.
To develop a small nonhuman primate model for filovirus disease, common marmosets
(Callithrix jacchus) were intramuscularly inoculated with wild type Marburgvirus 
Musoke or Ebolavirus Zaire. The infection resulted in a systemic fatal disease
with clinical and morphological features closely resembling human infection.
Animals experienced weight loss, fever, high virus titers in tissue,
thrombocytopenia, neutrophilia, high liver transaminases and phosphatases and
disseminated intravascular coagulation. Evidence of a severe disseminated viral
infection characterized principally by multifocal to coalescing hepatic necrosis 
was seen in EBOV animals. MARV-infected animals displayed only moderate fibrin
deposition in the spleen. Lymphoid necrosis and lymphocytic depletion observed in
spleen. These findings provide support for the use of the common marmoset as a
small nonhuman primate model for filovirus induced hemorrhagic fever.

Bioisoteric replacement of the metabolically labile N-methyl amide group of a
series of benzoxazinones with small heterocyclic rings has led to novel series of
fused tricyclic benzoxazines which are potent 5-HT(1A/B/D) receptor antagonists
with and without concomitant human serotonin transporter (hSerT) activity.
Optimizing against multiple parameters in parallel identified
6-{2-[4-(2-methyl-5-quinolinyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl}-4H-imidazo[5,1-c][1,4]benzox
azine-3-carboxamide (GSK588045) as a potent 5-HT(1A/B/D) receptor antagonist with
a high degree of selectivity over human ether-a-go-go related gene (hERG)
potassium channels, favorable pharmacokinetics, and excellent activity in vivo in
rodent pharmacodynamic (PD) models. On the basis of its outstanding overall
profile, this compound was progressed as a clinical candidate with the ultimate
aim to assess its potential as a faster acting antidepressant/anxiolytic with
reduced side-effect burden.

BACKGROUND: This is the first study of the effect of epidermal growth factor
(EGF) on marmoset monkey oocytes matured in vitro.
METHODS: We have evaluated the effects of 10 ng/ml EGF in combination with 1 or
10 IU/ml of gonadotrophins (FSH/hCG 1:1 ratio) during in vitro maturation (IVM)
of marmoset oocytes. Immature cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) were retrieved from
ovarian antral follicles of unprimed monkeys. COCs from six animals (n= 268) used
in this study were randomly distributed among four experimental groups: (A) 1 FSH
+1 hCG; (B) 10 FSH +10 hCG; (C) 1 FSH +1 hCG + EGF; and (D) 10 FSH +10 hCG + EGF 
(where 1 and 10 are concentrations, IU/ml). After IVM, oocytes were fertilized in
vitro and embryos were allowed to progress up to 87-88 h.
RESULTS: the highest rate of total and radial cumulus expansion was observed in
Group A, with the lowest in Group B (P < 0.05). Neither maturation nor
fertilization rate were affected by gonadotrophin concentration or presence of
EGF. Addition of EGF increased degeneration and decreased first cleavage rate,
which was significantly lower in Group C than Group A (P < 0.005). Interestingly,
in the EGF groups some embryos cleaved faster than without EGF.
CONCLUSIONS: The effects of EGF are highly dependent on concentration of
gonadotrophins present in IVM medium. EGF has a negative effect on oocytes in the
presence of low gonadotrophins, but contrastingly partially protects oocytes from
the negative effects of high gonadotrophins. We propose that these observed
negative effects of EGF may suggest use of an inappropriate dose of growth
factor.

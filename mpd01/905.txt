Blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI) has become a major tool to map neural activity. However, the
spatiotemporal characteristics of the BOLD functional hemodynamic response across
the cortical layers remain poorly understood. While human fMRI studies suffer
from low spatiotemporal resolution, the use of anesthesia in animal models
introduces confounding factors. Additionally, inflow contributions to the fMRI
signal become non-negligible when short repetition times (TRs) are used. In the
present work, we mapped the BOLD fMRI response to somatosensory stimulation in
awake marmosets. To address the above technical concerns, we used a dual-echo
gradient-recalled echo planar imaging (GR-EPI) sequence to separate the
deoxyhemoglobin-related response (absolute T2* differences) from the
deoxyhemoglobin-unrelated response (relative S0 changes). We employed a spatial
saturation pulse to saturate incoming arterial spins and reduce inflow effects.
Functional GR-EPI images were obtained from a single coronal slice with two
different echo times (13.5 and 40.5ms) and TR=0.2s. BOLD, T2*, and S0 images were
calculated and their functional responses were detected in both hemispheres of
primary somatosensory cortex, from which five laminar regions (L1+2, L3, L4, L5, 
and L6) were derived. The spatiotemporal distribution of the BOLD response across
the cortical layers was heterogeneous, with the middle layers having the highest 
BOLD amplitudes and shortest onset times. ΔT2* also showed a similar trend.
However, functional S0 changes were detected only in L1+2, with a fast onset
time. Because inflow effects were minimized, the source of S0 functional changes 
in L1+2 could be attributed to a reduction of cerebrospinal fluid volume fraction
due to the functional increase in cerebral blood volume and to unmodeled T2*
changes in the extra- and intra-venous compartments. Caution should be exercised 
when interpreting laminar BOLD fMRI changes in superficial layers as surrogates
of underlying neural activity.

BACKGROUND: Functional 3D organ models such as precision-cut lung slices (PCLS)
have recently captured the attention of biomedical research. To enable wider
implementation in research and development, these new biologically relevant organ
models are being constantly refined. A very important issue is to improve the
preparation of high-quality RNA (ribonucleic acid) from PCLS for drug discovery
and development of new therapies. Gene expression analysis at different levels is
used as an important experimental readout. Genome-wide analysis using microarrays
is mostly applied for biomarker selection in disease models or in comprehensive
toxicological studies. Specific biomarker testing by reverse transcriptase
quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RTqPCR) is often used in efficacy
studies. Both applications require high-quality RNA as starting material for the 
generation of reliable data. Additionally, a small number of slices should be
sufficient for satisfactory RNA isolation to allow as many experimental
conditions as possible to be covered with a given tissue sample. Unfortunately,
the vast amount of agarose in PCLS impedes RNA extraction according to the
standard procedures.
RESULTS: We established an optimized protocol for RNA isolation from PCLS from
humans, rats, mice, marmosets, and rhesus macaques based on the separation of
lysis and precipitation steps and a magnetic-bead cleanup procedure. The
resulting RNA is of high purity and possesses a high degree of integrity. There
are no contaminations affecting RTqPCR efficiency or any enzymatic step in sample
preparation for microarray analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: In summary, we isolated RNA from PCLS from different species that is
well suited for RTqPCR and for microarray analysis as downstream applications.

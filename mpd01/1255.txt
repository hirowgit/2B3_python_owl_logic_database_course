Since the availability of the common marmoset monkey as a primate model in
neuroscience research has recently increased, much effort has been made to
develop a reliable guide of the brain structures of this species. In this
article, we review the development of the marmoset brain atlas and discuss a
newly developed brain model, which was reconstructed from histological sections
under volume-rendering technology. This kind of brain model allows virtual
sections to be constructed on any axis, with nomenclatural annotations to
structures in situ. This model is also applicable for the identification of
structures revealed in magnetic resonance imaging studies. The brain model is
accessible at the following web address:

Common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) have hand preferences for grasping pieces
of food and holding them while eating and these are stable throughout adult life.
We report here that left-handed marmosets have negative cognitive bias compared
to right-handed marmosets. Twelve marmosets were trained to expect a food reward 
from a bowl with a black lid and not from one with a white lid, or vice versa. In
probe tests with ambiguous, grey-lidded bowls a left-handed group (N=7) were less
likely to remove the lid to inspect the bowl than a right-handed group (N=5).
This difference between left- and right-handed marmosets was not dependent on
rate of learning, sex or age. In fact, hand-preference was not associated with
rate of learning the task. Furthermore, retrospective examination of colony
records of 39 marmosets revealed that more aggression was directed towards left- 
than right-handed marmosets. Hence, hand preference, which can be measured
easily, could serve as an indicator of cognitive bias and may signal a need for
particular care in laboratory environments. We explain the results by arguing
that hand preference reflects more frequent (or dominant) use of the opposite
hemisphere and this predisposes individuals to behave differently.

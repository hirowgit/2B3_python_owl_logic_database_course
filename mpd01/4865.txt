Characteristics of cell lines established from Epstein-Barr virus induced
marmoset tumors.

Neubauer RH, Rabin H, Hopkins RF 3rd, Levy BM.

The inoculation of a cotton-topped marmoset with B95-8 strain of EBV resulted in 
the induction of a multifocal lymphoma and lymphoblastoid cell lines were
established from liver, spleen and mesenteric lymph node tumors. The cell lines
were remarkably similar to each other with respect to the presence of EBV and its
expression, the surface properties of the cells and their stability, and the
functional products of the cells. Karyotypic examination of the cell lines
revealed the common loss of a single chromosome. The slight differences noted in 
karyotypes suggest some divergence from a tumor stem cell and imply a clonal
origin. Thus, EBV-induced lymphomas in cotton-topped marmosets resemble Burkitt's
lymphoma in man.

Studies with the baboon endogenous virus and its pseudotype of murine sarcoma
virus in marmosets.

Heberling RL, Kalter SS, Eichberg JW, Levy BM.

Three marmoset species (Saguinus oedipus oedipus, S. fuscicollis, Callithrix
jacchus) failed to show evidence of infection or disease following inoculation of
baboon endogenous type-C virus (BaEV). Cells infected with a Kirsten murine
sarcoma-BaEV pseudotype (MSV[BaEV]) produced a progressive fibrosarcoma in S. o. 
oedipus and tumors in S. fuscicollis and C. jacchus which regressed. Tumor
formation is believed to be due to growth of inoculated, virus-infected cells and
not transformation of marmoset cells. S. o. oedipus showed the best serum
neutralizing antibody response to BaEV and MSV(BaEV), S. fuscicollis a moderate
response and C. jacchus no response.

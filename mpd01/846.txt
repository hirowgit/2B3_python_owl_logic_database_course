Whereas the ovary produces the majority of estradiol (E2) in mature female
primates, extraovarian sources contribute to E2 synthesis and action, including
the brain E2-regulating hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone. In
ovary-intact female rodent models, aromatase inhibition (AI) induces a polycystic
ovary syndrome-like hypergonadotropic hyperandrogenism due to absent E2-mediated 
negative feedback. To examine the role of extraovarian E2 on nonhuman primate
gonadotropin regulation, the present study uses letrozole to elicit AI in adult
female marmoset monkeys. Sixteen female marmosets (Callithrix jacchus; >2 yr)
were randomly assigned to ovary-intact or ovariectomy (OVX) conditions and
subsequently placed on a daily oral regimen of either ~200 µl vehicle alone
(ovary-intact Control, n = 3; OVX, n = 3) or 1 mg ⋅ kg-1 ⋅ day-1 letrozole in
vehicle (ovary-intact AI, n = 4; OVX + AI, n = 6). Blood samples were collected
every 10 days, and plasma chorionic gonadotropin (CG) and steroid hormone levels 
were determined by validated radioimmunoassay and liquid chromatography/tandem
mass spectrometry, respectively. Ovary-intact, AI-treated and OVX females
exhibited elevated CG (P < 0.01, P = 0.004, respectively) compared with controls,
and after 30 days, OVX + AI females exhibited a suprahypergonadotropic phenotype 
(P = 0.004) compared with ovary-intact + AI and OVX females. Androstenedione (P =
0.03) and testosterone (P = 0.05) were also elevated in ovary-intact, AI-treated 
females above all other groups. The current study thus confirms in a nonhuman
primate that E2 depletion and diminished negative feedback in ovary-intact
females engage hypergonadotropic hyperandrogenism. Additionally, we demonstrate
that extraovarian estrogens, possibly neuroestrogens, contribute to female
negative feedback regulation of gonadotropin release.

Hemoplasmas, the erythrocyte-associated mycoplasmas, have been detected in
several primates, causing mostly subclinical infection. This study aimed to
determine the prevalence of hemoplasma infection in captive and free-ranging
monkeys from southern Brazil, as well as factors and hematological abnormalities 
associated with infection. Blood samples from 40 non-human primates (NHP) were
tested for hemoplasmas and coinfections. An overall of 10/40 (25.0%) NHP tested
positive for hemoplasmas using PCR-based assays, including 9/14 (64.3%) black
howler monkeys (Alouatta caraya) and 1/24 (4.2%) black-horned capuchin (Sapajus
nigritus). Infection was not statistically associated with anemia, but wild-born 
monkeys and male black howler monkeys were more likely to be positive when
compared with captive-born animals and female black howler monkeys, respectively.
The sequences from the black howler monkey hemoplasma were similar (94% identity)
to the squirrel monkey hemoplasma ("Candidatus Mycoplasma kahanei") and were
phylogenetically located in a different cluster when compared to the human
hemoplasma ("Candidatus Mycoplasma haemohominis").

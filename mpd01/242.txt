The ability to generate in vitro cultures of neuronal cells has been instrumental
in advancing our understanding of the nervous system. Rodent models have been the
principal source of brain cells used in primary cultures for over a century,
providing insights that are widely applicable to human diseases. However,
therapeutic agents that showed benefit in rodent models, particularly those
pertaining to aging and age-associated dementias, have frequently failed in
clinical trials. This discrepancy established a potential "translational gap"
between human and rodent studies that may at least partially be explained by the 
phylogenetic distance between rodent and primate species. Several non-human
primate (NHP) species, including the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), have
been used extensively in neuroscience research, but in contrast to rodent models,
practical approaches to the generation of primary cell culture systems amenable
to molecular studies that can inform in vivo studies are lacking. Marmosets are a
powerful model in biomedical research and particularly in studies of aging and
age-associated diseases because they exhibit an aging phenotype similar to
humans. Here, we report a practical method to culture primary marmoset neurons
and astrocytes from brains of medically euthanized postnatal day 0 (P0) marmoset 
newborns that yield highly pure primary neuron and astrocyte cultures. Primary
marmoset neuron and astrocyte cultures can be generated reliably to provide a
powerful NHP in vitro model in neuroscience research that may enable mechanistic 
studies of nervous system aging and of age-related neurodegenerative disorders.
Because neuron and astrocyte cultures can be used in combination with in vivo
approaches in marmosets, primary marmoset neuron and astrocyte cultures may help 
bridge the current translational gap between basic and clinical studies in
nervous system aging and age-associated neurological diseases.

BACKGROUND: The capuchin is a neotropical primate that presents easy reproduction
in captivity and is used in scientific research. The objective of this work was
to describe the structure and the branching pattern of the brachial plexus of the
capuchin and to compare the results with data from the literature for humans,
chimpanzees, baboons and Callithrix.
METHODS: Twelve specimens were used: eight males and four females. No animals
were killed for the purpose of this study.
RESULTS: The brachial plexus of Sapajus sp was constituted mainly from the
ventral roots of the last four cervical spinal nerves, from C5 to C8, mainly, and
the first thoracic nerve (T1).
CONCLUSIONS: The pattern of formation of the brachial plexus of the capuchin
monkey was more similar to that of Callithrix and baboons, perhaps because they
are the only primates in this study to be essentially quadrupedal.

Burkholderia pseudomallei is the causative agent of melioidosis, which is a Gram 
negative, facultative intracellular bacterium. Disease is prevalent in SE Asia
and in northern Australia, as well as in other tropical and subtropical regions. 
Recently, there is an increasing awareness of the importance of bacterial
ingestion as a potential route of infection, particularly in cases of unexplained
origin of the disease. The marmoset is a New World Monkey (NWM) species that is
being developed as an alternative NHP model to complement the more traditionally 
used Old World Monkeys (OWM). Models have been developed for the traditional
routes of disease acquisition, subcutaneous and inhalational. This manuscript
details the development and characterisation of an ingestion model of
melioidosis. Dose-ranging study assessed the lethality of B. pseudomallei and
disease progression was assessed by euthanizing animals at predetermined time
points, 12, 36, 48 and 54 hours post-challenge. Challenge doses of greater than
6.2 x 106 cfu resulted in an acute, lethal, febrile disease. Following challenge 
the lung was the first organ, outside of the gastrointestinal tract, to become
colonised. Enteritis (duodenitis, ileitis and/or jejunitis) was observed in
sections of the small intestine from animals that succumbed to disease. However, 
the most severe pathological features were observed in the mesenteric lymph nodes
from these animals. These findings are consistent with lymphatic draining as
route of dissemination.

BACKGROUND: The Callithrix geoffroyi are increasingly present in Brazilian urban 
areas, where they are vulnerable to health problems. The purpose of this study
was a description of hematology and nine blood chemistry parameters of
free-ranging C. geoffroyi.
METHODS: Thirty individuals were captured in urban-forested settings. The
marmosets were anesthetized, venopunctioned, and released shortly after recovery.
The analysis was carried on in a veterinary laboratory, using automatic cells
counter, staining methods, and an automatic biochemical analyzer.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Male and female free-ranging C. geoffroyi have similar
hematological and blood chemistry values. The adults presented higher
concentrations of erythrocytes (P <.02) and hemoglobin (P <.02) than young
marmosets. The platelet concentration was lower (P <.05) in adults comparing to
young marmosets. There were not statistically significant differences between
young and adult blood chemistry concentrations. This is the first time that are
presented hematology and blood biochemistry data on free-ranging C. geoffroyi.

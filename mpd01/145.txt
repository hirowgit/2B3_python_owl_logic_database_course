A quantitative evaluation of motility is crucial for studies employing
experimental animals. Here, we describe the development of an in-cage motility
monitoring method for new world monkeys using off-the-shelf components, and
demonstrate its capability for long-term operation (e.g., a year). Based on this 
novel system, we characterized the motility of the common marmoset over different
time scales (seconds, hours, days, and weeks). Monitoring of seven young animals 
belonging to two different age groups (sub-adult and young-adult) over a 231-day 
period revealed: (1) strictly diurnal activity (97.3% of movement during
daytime), (2) short-cycle (∼20 s) transition in activity, and (3) bimodal diurnal
activity including a "siesta" break. Additionally, while the mean duration of
short-cycle activity, net daily activity, and diurnal activity changed over the
course of development, 24-h periodicity remained constant. Finally, the method
allowed for detection of progressive motility deterioration in a transgenic
marmoset. Motility measurement offers a convenient way to characterize
developmental and pathological changes in animals, as well as an economical and
labor-free means for long-term evaluation in a wide range of basic and
translational studies.

BACKGROUND: A survey was developed to characterize disease incidence, common
pathology lesions, environmental characteristics, and nutrition programs within
captive research marmoset colonies.
METHODS: Seventeen research facilities completed the electronic survey.
RESULTS: Nutritional management programs varied amongst research institutions
housing marmosets; eight primary base diets were reported. The most common
clinical syndromes reported were gastrointestinal disease (i.e. inflammatory
bowel disease like disease, chronic lymphocytic enteritis, chronic malabsorption,
chronic diarrhea), metabolic bone disease or fracture, infectious diarrhea, and
oral disease (tooth root abscesses, gingivitis, tooth root resorption). The five 
most common pathology morphologic diagnoses were colitis, nephropathy/nephritis, 
enteritis, chronic lymphoplasmacytic enteritis, and cholecystitis. Obesity was
more common (average 20% of a reporting institution's population) than thin body 
condition (average 5%).
CONCLUSIONS: Through review of current practices, we aim to inspire development
of evidence-based practices to standardize husbandry and nutrition practices for 
marmoset research colonies.

Distribution of ciliated epithelial cells in the trachea of common marmosets
(Callithrix jacchus).

Hoffmann R, Braun A, Knauf S, Kaup FJ, Bleyer M.

BACKGROUND: The distribution of ciliated cells in the tracheal epithelium of
common marmosets was evaluated.
METHODS: Light and scanning electron microscopy of tracheal epithelium was
performed.
RESULTS: Ciliated cells were concentrated in cartilage-free areas and virtually
absent in cartilage-supported epithelial regions.
CONCLUSIONS: Heterogeneous distribution of ciliated cells in the trachea has to
be considered when using animal models for translational respiratory research
approaches.

The aerosol characteristics of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) were evaluated to
achieve reproducible infection of experimental animals with aerosolized RVFV
suitable for animal efficacy studies. Spray factor (SF), the ratio between the
concentrations of the aerosolized agent to the agent in the aerosol generator, is
used to compare performance differences between aerosol exposures. SF indicates
the efficiency of the aerosolization process; a higher SF means a lower nebulizer
concentration is needed to achieve a desired inhaled dose. Relative humidity
levels as well as the duration of the exposure and choice of exposure chamber all
impacted RVFV SF. Differences were also noted between actual and predicted minute
volumes for different species of nonhuman primates. While NHP from Old World
species (Macaca fascicularis, M. mulatta, Chlorocebus aethiops) generally had a
lower actual minute volume than predicted, the actual minute volume for marmosets
(Callithrix jacchus) was higher than predicted (150% for marmosets compared with 
an average of 35% for all other species examined). All of these factors (relative
humidity, chamber, duration, and minute volume) impact the ability to reliably
and reproducibly deliver a specific dose of aerosolized RVFV. The implications of
these findings for future pivotal efficacy studies are discussed.

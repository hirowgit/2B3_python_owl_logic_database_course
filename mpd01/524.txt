In November 2015, an 83-d-old juvenile male common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) 
in good body condition was found dead in his family cage with no previous
premonitory signs. Necropsy revealed a gas-distended abdomen, feces-distended
large bowel, and a full-thickness distal colonic perforation resulting in fecal
peritonitis. The distal colon ended in a blind pouch at 7 mm prior to the
expected anal opening, consistent with atresia ani. Here we present this case,
briefly discuss the human and veterinary literature regarding correction of
anorectal malformations, and highlight the importance of identifying such
devastating congenital defects in breeding colonies while limiting the disruption
and handling of seemingly healthy, young NHP raised in a complex social setting.

Humans and vocal animals use vocalizations to communicate with members of their
species. A necessary function of auditory perception is to generalize across the 
high variability inherent in vocalization production and classify them into
behaviorally distinct categories ('words' or 'call types'). Here, we demonstrate 
that detecting mid-level features in calls achieves production-invariant
classification. Starting from randomly chosen marmoset call features, we use a
greedy search algorithm to determine the most informative and least redundant
features necessary for call classification. High classification performance is
achieved using only 10-20 features per call type. Predictions of tuning
properties of putative feature-selective neurons accurately match some observed
auditory cortical responses. This feature-based approach also succeeds for call
categorization in other species, and for other complex classification tasks such 
as caller identification. Our results suggest that high-level neural
representations of sounds are based on task-dependent features optimized for
specific computational goals.

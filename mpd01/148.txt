The accurate and complete assembly of both haplotype sequences of a diploid
organism is essential to understanding the role of variation in genome functions,
phenotypes and diseases1. Here, using a trio-binning approach, we present a
high-quality, diploid reference genome, with both haplotypes assembled
independently at the chromosome level, for the common marmoset (Callithrix
jacchus), an primate model system that is widely used in biomedical research2,3. 
The full spectrum of heterozygosity between the two haplotypes involves 1.36% of 
the genome-much higher than the 0.13% indicated by the standard estimation based 
on single-nucleotide heterozygosity alone. The de novo mutation rate is
0.43 × 10-8 per site per generation, and the paternal inherited genome acquired
twice as many mutations as the maternal. Our diploid assembly enabled us to
discover a recent expansion of the sex-differentiation region and unique
evolutionary changes in the marmoset Y chromosome. In addition, we identified
many genes with signatures of positive selection that might have contributed to
the evolution of Callithrix biological features. Brain-related genes were highly 
conserved between marmosets and humans, although several genes experienced
lineage-specific copy number variations or diversifying selection, with
implications for the use of marmosets as a model system.

Surgery in humans is continuously evolving and promoted minimally invasive
treatment. On the other hand, despite the importance of the 3Rs principles for
experimental animals is well documented, no reports describe specific
methodologies for implementing "refinement" in practice. Here, we describe a new 
technique, the "Ohta Method" for caudal arthrocentesis in the pursuit of the 3Rs 
for animal experiments and the development of innovative methods for
investigating systemic organ arteries through minimally invasive procedures. This
procedure requires only a percutaneous puncture of the caudal artery without any 
injury to the limb or body trunk. In addition, it does not cut down the artery,
making hemostasis easier and recovering arterial damage easier. We will show
multiple organ artery angiographies in marmoset for the first time in the world. 
The principle described in this paper could also be applied to many other small
animals, such as rats. Moreover, using this method, multiple doses of the drug or
cells can be administered to the target organ at the time of therapeutic
intervention, thereby enabling the establishment of more sophisticated and
complex therapeutic intervention studies as translational research.

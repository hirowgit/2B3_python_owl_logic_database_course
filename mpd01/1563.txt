Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonists have been shown to be
efficacious as abortive migraine therapeutics with the absence of cardiovascular 
liabilities that are associated with triptans. Herein, we report the discovery of
a highly potent CGRP receptor antagonist, BMS-742413, with the potential to
provide rapid onset of action through intranasal delivery. The compound displays 
excellent aqueous solubility, oxidative stability, and toxicological profile.
BMS-742413 has good intranasal bioavailability in the rabbit and shows a robust, 
dose-dependent inhibition of CGRP-induced increases in marmoset facial blood
flow.

It is considered that functional deficiency of the NMDA receptors in the
prefrontal cortex (PFC) is one of the causes of the cognitive impairment observed
in schizophrenia. As non-human primates display more developed PFC than rodents, 
they are considered to be useful experimental animals for improving the
predictive validity of models used to discover new drugs for treating cognitive
dysfunction. The aim of this study was to develop a convenient model of the
cognitive impairment observed in schizophrenia using common marmosets and the
CANTAB system and to test whether a full agonist of the dopamine D1 receptor
(SKF-81297) was effective against the cognitive impairment induced in this model.
We administered the NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine (1.5-16mg/kg, i.m.) to the 
marmosets to induce cognitive impairment and then evaluated their working memory 
function using the CANTAB spatial working memory (SWM) test. The marmosets'
working memory was impaired by subanesthetic doses of ketamine. Next, we tested
the effect of SKF-81297 (3 or 10mg/kg, p.o.) on this ketamine-induced cognitive
dysfunction. The marmosets were administered SKF-81297 30min before the ketamine 
injection. Pretreatment with SKF-81297 reversed the ketamine-induced cognitive
deficiency. In this study, we found that a D1 receptor agonist, which has been
reported to enhance cognitive function, reversed ketamine-induced cognitive
impairment in marmosets, which suggests that our marmoset model could be a useful
tool for predicting the clinical efficacy of cognitive-enhancing drugs.

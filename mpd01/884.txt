Slow loris (Nycticebus spp.) captive diets have been based on routine and
anecdotes rather than scientific fact. The growing body of evidence contradicts
the high fruit diet supported by such anecdotes. Non-human primate nutrient
requirements are grouped into new (based on the common marmoset Callithrix
jacchus) or old world (based on rhesus macaques Macaca mulatta) primates. Slow
lorises are known to suffer from many health ailments in captivity such as dental
disease, obesity, wasting and kidney issues all of which have been linked to
diet. This study aimed to estimate nutrient intake from free-ranging slow lorises
and to determine whether this intake can be used as nutrient recommendations. We 
collected data of nutrient intake, food passage rate and digestibility of captive
slow lorises on three diet treatments 1: current captive type diet which is
mostly fruits, 2: wild-type diet made only of food items from their natural diet,
3: new diet made to reflect wild slow loris nutrient intake. In order to validate
our nutrient recommendations, diets 2 and 3 would have to be significantly
different to Diet 1 in terms of nutrients, but not different from each other.
Captive diets were significantly higher in soluble carbohydrates and lower in
minerals and fibre fractions than both diets 2 and 3. Diets 2 and 3 led to a
significantly increased food passage time and to more effective fibre and calcium
digestion compared to Diet 1. We also observed obese individuals lost weight and 
underweight individuals gained weight. Our nutrient recommendations have been
validated by our trials, and new or old world monkey nutrient recommendations are
not consistent with our results. Diets should be high in protein and fibre and
low in soluble carbohydrates and fats.

1. Roles of human cytochrome P450 (P450) 3A4 in oxidation of an antihistaminic
drug terfenadine have been previously investigated in association with
terfenadine-ketoconazole interaction. Several antihistamine drugs have been
recently identified as substrates for multiple P450 enzymes. In this study,
overall roles of P450 3A4, 2J2, and 4F12 enzymes in terfenadine t-butyl
hydroxylation were investigated in small intestines and livers from humans,
marmosets, and/or cynomolgus monkeys. 2. Human liver microsomes and liver and
small intestine microsomes from marmosets and cynomolgus monkeys effectively
mediated terfenadine t-butyl hydroxylation. Ketoconazole and
N-hydroxy-N'-(4-butyl-2-methylphenyl)-formamidine (a P450 4A/F inhibitor) almost 
completely and moderately inhibited these activities, respectively, in human
liver microsomes; however, these chemicals did not show substantially suppression
in marmoset liver. Anti-human P450 3A and 4F antibodies showed the roughly
supportive inhibitory effects. 3. Recombinant P450 3A4/90 and 4F12 showed high
terfenadine t-butyl hydroxylation activities with substrate inhibition constants 
of 84-144 μM (under 26-76 μM of Km values), in similar manners to liver and
intestine microsomes. 4. These results suggest that human and marmoset P450
3A4/90 and 4F12 in livers or small intestines played important roles in
terfenadine t-butyl hydroxylation. Marmosets could be a model for humans during
first pass extraction of terfenadine and related substrates.

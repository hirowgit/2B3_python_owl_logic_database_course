Recent progress in regenerative medicine has enabled the utilization of
pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) as the resource of therapeutic cells/tissue.
However, immune suppression is still needed when the donor-recipient combination 
is allogeneic. We have reported previously that mouse PSCs-derived
immunosuppressive cells contribute to prolonged survival of grafts derived from
the same mouse PSCs in allogeneic recipients. For its clinical application, a
preclinical study using non-human primates such as common marmoset must be
performed. In this study, we established the induction protocol of
immunosuppressive cells from common marmoset ES cells. Although similar
immunosuppressive macrophages could not be induced by same protocol as that for
mouse PSCs, we employed an inhibitor for histone methyltransferase, DZNep, and
succeeded to induce them. The DZNep-treated macrophage-like cells expressed
several immunosuppressive molecules and significantly inhibited allogeneic mixed 
lymphocyte reaction. The immunosuppressive cells from non-human primate ESCs will
help to establish an immunoregulating strategy in regenerative medicine using
PSCs.

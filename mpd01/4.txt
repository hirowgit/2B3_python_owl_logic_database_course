Chronic gastrointestinal (GI) diseases are the most common diseases in captive
common marmosets. To understand the role of the microbiome in GI diseases, we
characterized the gut microbiome of 91 healthy marmosets (303 samples) and 59
marmosets diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (200 samples). Healthy 
marmosets exhibited "humanized," Bacteroidetes-dominant microbiomes. After up to 
2 years of standardized diet, housing and husbandry, marmoset microbiomes could
be classified into four distinct marmoset sources based on Prevotella and
Bacteroides levels. Using a random forest (RF) model, marmosets were classified
by source with an accuracy of 93% with 100% sensitivity and 95% specificity using
abundance data from 4 Prevotellaceae amplicon sequence variants (ASVs), as well
as single ASVs from Coprobacter, Parabacteroides, Paraprevotella,
Phascolarctobacterium, Oribacterium and Fusobacterium. A single dysbiotic IBD
state was not found across all marmoset sources, but IBD was associated with
lower alpha diversity and a lower Bacteroides:Prevotella copri ratio within each 
source. IBD was highest in a Prevotella-dominant cohort, and consistent with
Prevotella-linked diseases, pro-inflammatory genes in the jejunum were
upregulated. RF analysis of serum biomarkers identified serum calcium, hemoglobin
and red blood cell (RBC) counts as potential biomarkers for marmoset IBD. This
study characterizes the microbiome of healthy captive common marmosets and
demonstrates that source-specific microbiomes can be retained despite
standardized diets and husbandry practices. Marmosets with IBD had decreased
alpha diversity and a shift in the ratio of Bacteroides:Prevotella copri compared
to healthy marmosets.

A pregnant common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) showed tachypnea, hypothermia,
and anorexia at close to the expected delivery date. Severe anemia and
thrombocytopenia, schistocytes, and high levels of LDH and D-dimer were observed.
Three days after the onset of clinical signs, a cesarean section was conducted
due to stillbirth. Marmoset immediately recovered after surgery, and the abnormal
CBC and blood chemistry parameters before surgery returned to the normal ranges. 
Diagnosis of pregnancy-associated thrombotic microangiopathy was made because
removal of infant and placenta is curative. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first case report of thrombotic microangiopathy in a marmoset with
preeclampsia.

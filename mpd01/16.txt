Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne arbovirus that can cause severe congenital 
birth defects. The utmost goal of ZIKV vaccines is to prevent both maternal-fetal
infection and congenital Zika syndrome. A Zika purified inactivated virus (ZPIV) 
was previously shown to be protective in non-pregnant mice and rhesus macaques.
In this study, we further examined the efficacy of ZPIV against ZIKV infection
during pregnancy in immunocompetent C57BL6 mice and common marmoset monkeys
(Callithrix jacchus). We showed that, in C57BL/6 mice, ZPIV significantly reduced
ZIKV-induced fetal malformations. Protection of fetuses was positively correlated
with virus-neutralizing antibody levels. In marmosets, the vaccine prevented
vertical transmission of ZIKV and elicited neutralizing antibodies that remained 
above a previously determined threshold of protection for up to 18 months. These 
proof-of-concept studies demonstrate ZPIV's protective efficacy is both potent
and durable and has the potential to prevent the harmful consequence of ZIKV
infection during pregnancy.

The native marmoset of the Southeastern Atlantic Forest in Brazil is among the 25
most endangered primates of the world. Hybridization with alien species is one of
its main threats registered since the early 2000s based on phenotype, so far,
without genetic confirmation. Using uniparental molecular markers, we analyzed 18
putative hybrids, captured from 2004 to 2013 in different localities of the
Atlantic Forest. A nine base pair deletion in the SRY gene of C. aurita was used 
to investigate paternal ancestry. Maternal ancestry was assessed by DNA
sequencing of ca. 455 bp from the COX2 gene. Hybridization was confirmed for 16
out of the 18 marmosets since they inherited COX2 haplotypes of the alien C.
penicillata or C. jacchus and the SRY deletion specific to C. aurita. Two
individuals inherited both parental lineages of C. aurita, which is probably
related to backcrossing or hybrid interbreeding. The direction of hybridization
of females with the matrilineal lineage of invasive species with males descending
from the native lineage was predominant in our sampling. This is the first time
that hybridization between C. aurita and invasive species has been confirmed
through genetic analysis.

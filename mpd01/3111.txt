The neurovirulence of two mumps virus strains was compared using marmosets.
Marmosets were inoculated intravenously with the wild-type mumps virus Odate
strain, resulting in evident meningitis in 1 of 3 marmosets at each of the weeks 
3, 4, and 5 postinoculation, representing a total of 3 out of 9 marmosets.
Nephritis, parotitis, pancreatitis, and tonsillitis were manifest in addition to 
central nervous system (CNS) sequelae. On the other hand, the Jeryl Lynn vaccine 
strain did not induce histopathological changes in the CNS and multiplication of 
the Jeryl Lynn strain was distinctly lower compared to that of the Odate strain
in the marmoset. This is the first report to describe the induction of meningitis
in non-human primates after peripheral inoculation of a wild-type mumps virus,
presenting findings useful for the elucidation of the mechanism of infection and 
pathology of mumps virus in the CNS. The distinction observed between the Odate
and Jeryl Lynn strains suggests the applicability of the marmoset model for the
evaluation of any neurovirulence potential of vaccine strains.

A new Rabies virus variant, with no close antigenic or genetic relationship to
any known rabies variants found in bats or terrestrial mammals in the Americas,
was identified in association with human rabies cases reported from the state of 
Ceará, Brazil, from 1991 to 1998. The marmoset, Callithrix jacchus acchus, was
determined to be the source of exposure.

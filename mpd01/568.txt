Microelectrode implants are an important tool in neuroscience research and in
developing brain⁻machine interfaces. Data from rodents have consistently shown
that astrocytes are recruited to the area surrounding implants, forming a glial
scar that increases electrode impedance and reduces chronic utility. However,
studies in non-human primates are scarce, with none to date in marmosets. We used
glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunostaining to characterize the acute
and chronic response of the marmoset brain to microelectrodes. By using
densitometry, we showed that marmoset astrocytes surround brain implants and that
a glial scar is formed over time, with significant increase in the chronic
condition relative to the acute condition animal.

The current model, based on rodent data, proposes that thalamocortical afferents 
(TCA) innervate the subplate towards the end of cortical neurogenesis. This
implies that the laminar identity of cortical neurons is specified by intrinsic
instructions rather than information of thalamic origin. In order to determine
whether this mechanism is conserved in the primates, we examined the growth of
thalamocortical (TCA) and corticofugal afferents in early human and monkey fetal 
development. In the human, TCA, identified by secretagogin, calbindin, and ROBO1 
immunoreactivity, were observed in the internal capsule of the ventral
telencephalon as early as 7-7.5 PCW, crossing the pallial/subpallial boundary
(PSB) by 8 PCW before the calretinin immunoreactive corticofugal fibers do.
Furthermore, TCA were observed to be passing through the intermediate zone and
innervating the presubplate of the dorsolateral cortex, and already by 10-12 PCW 
TCAs were occupying much of the cortex. Observations at equivalent stages in the 
marmoset confirmed that this pattern is conserved across primates. Therefore, our
results demonstrate that in primates, TCAs innervate the cortical presubplate at 
earlier stages than previously demonstrated by acetylcholinesterase
histochemistry, suggesting that pioneer thalamic afferents may contribute to
early cortical circuitry that can participate in defining cortical neuron
phenotypes.

1. The distribution chondroitin 4- and 6-sulfates in the epiphysial cartilages of
several mammals are reported. 2. Chondroitin 6-sulfate is present in higher
relative proportion in articular surfaces of young and adult epiphysial
cartilages in most of the mammals studied. 3. Exception to this was found in some
species of the order Rodentia in which chondroitin 4-sulfate was almost the only 
chondroitin present in young and adult cartilages. 4. These and other results
suggest that chondroitin 4-sulfate may be an important component for the
calcification process, whereas chondroitin 6-sulfate seems to be related to the
integrity of the articular surfaces.

Pregnancy diagnosis in the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus jacchus).

Lunn SF, Hobson BM, Hearn JP.

Abdominal palpation of the uterus was carried out on 25 pregnant and 29
non-pregnant marmosets (Callithrix jacchus jacchus). 195 complete 24-hour urine
specimens, collected between the first week of gestation and term (21 weeks),
were tested with the Sub-Human Primate Tube (SHPT) test. No significant
differences between the two methods in their ability to diagnose pregnancy were
obtained between the first and 13th week of gestation. The SHPT test was seldom
positive after the 13th week of pregnancy, whereas, with one exception, palpation
always indicated pregnancy.

Contemporary studies recognize 3 distinct cytoarchitectural and functional areas 
within the Brodmann area 8 complex, in the caudal prefrontal cortex: 8b, 8aD, and
8aV. Here, we report on the quantitative characteristics of the cortical
projections to these areas, using injections of fluorescent tracers in marmoset
monkeys. Area 8b was distinct from both 8aD and 8aV due to its connections with
medial prefrontal, anterior cingulate, superior temporal polysensory, and ventral
midline/retrosplenial areas. In contrast, areas 8aD and 8aV received the bulk of 
the projections from posterior parietal cortex and dorsal midline areas. In the
frontal lobe, area 8aV received projections primarily from ventrolateral areas,
while both 8aD and 8b received dense inputs from areas on the dorsolateral
surface. Whereas area 8aD received the most significant auditory projections,
these were relatively sparse, in comparison with those previously reported in
macaques. Finally, area 8aV was distinct from both 8aD and 8b by virtue of its
widespread input from the extrastriate visual areas. These results are compatible
with a homologous organization of the prefrontal cortex in New and Old World
monkeys, and suggest significant parallels between the present pathways, revealed
by tract-tracing, and networks revealed by functional connectivity analysis in
Old World monkeys and humans.

The development of biologic molecules (monoclonal antibodies, cytokines, soluble 
receptors) as specific therapeutics for human disease creates a need for animal
models in which safety and efficacy can be tested. Models in lower animal species
are precluded when the reagents fail to recognize their targets, which is often
the case in rats and mice. In this Feature article we will highlight the common
marmoset, a small-bodied nonhuman primate (NHP), as a useful model in biomedical 
and preclinical translational research.

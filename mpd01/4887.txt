Sapin MR, Kafieva TA.

The iliac lymphatic caudal nodes disposed along the external iliac artery as
three chains (lateral, median or prevenous, and medial) were studied in 89
corpses of green monkeys. In two chains (lateral and retrovascular) the cranial
iliac lymphatic nodes are adjacent to the common iliac artery. The number of
nodes in each chain varies from one to five. One node of the group of caudal
iliac nodes-femoral-is present almost in all preparations. The lymphatic system
of the pelvis of the monkeys studied is arranged according to a common bilateral 
plan characteristic of all mammals.

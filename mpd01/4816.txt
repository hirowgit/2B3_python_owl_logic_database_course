The effects of metoclopramide, sulpiride, and the stereoisomers of baclofen on
amphetamine-induced behavior in the marmoset.

Ridley RM, Scraggs PR, Baker HF.

We have studied the effects on amphetamine-induced behavior in a primate species 
of drugs (other than the classic neuroleptics) sometimes used in the treatment of
psychosis. Marmosets were treated with either saline (control animals) or
amphetamine followed after 18 min by doses of either metoclopramide, sulpiride,
or the d- or l-isomers of baclofen. Metoclopramide antagonized
amphetamine-induced behavior at low doses while also causing sedation at higher
doses in control animals. Neither sulpiride nor baclofen specifically antagonized
amphetamine-induced behavior.

[Histoenzymologic data on the epithelial cells of the gastric mucosa of marmosets
(Callithrix jacchus & Callithrix penicillata)].

[Article in Portuguese]

Miraglia T, Moura CS, Chezzi LA.

The gastric mucosa of marmosets is devoid of UDPG-GT; phosphorylases; G-6-PA;
F-1,6-PA; alanyl aminopeptidase and leucine aminopeptidase. Only the acid
phosphatase was seen with a stronger reactivity in the chief cells. The other
enzymes (LDH; G-6-PDH; 6-PGDH; NADPH2-TR; cis-aconitase; ICDH; SDH; MDH;
cytochrome oxidase; NADH2-TR; a-GPDH; b-OHBDH and nonspecific esterase) showed a 
stronger reactivity in the parietal cells.

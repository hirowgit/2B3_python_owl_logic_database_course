Age-related cognitive decline has been extensively studied in humans, but the
majority of research designs are cross-sectional and compare across younger and
older adults. Longitudinal studies are necessary to capture variability in
cognitive aging trajectories but are difficult to carry out in humans and
long-lived nonhuman primates. Marmosets are an ideal primate model for
neurocognitive aging as their naturally short lifespan facilitates longitudinal
designs. In a longitudinal study of marmosets tested on reversal learning
starting in middle-age, we found that, on average, the group of marmosets
declined in cognitive performance around 8 years of age. However, we found highly
variable patterns of cognitive aging trajectories across individuals. Preliminary
analyses of brain tissues from this cohort also show highly variable degrees of
neuropathology. Future work will tie together behavioral trajectories with brain 
pathology and provide a window into the factors that predict age-related
cognitive decline.

Paraoxonase (PON) plays roles in the metabolism of organophosphate xenobiotics
and drugs. Despite the importance of marmosets for research into drug metabolism 
and pharmacokinetics, marmoset paraoxonase has not yet been fully characterized. 
Consequently, we identified the PON1 gene in the marmoset genome by sequence
homology analysis. Marmoset PON1 cDNA containing an open reading frame (1065 bp) 
was successfully cloned from marmoset liver by reverse transcription-polymerase
chain reaction. The deduced amino acid sequence (355 amino acids) has
approximately 93% identity with the human ortholog and contains important amino
acid residues for substrate binding and calcium ion coordination. According to a 
phylogenetic tree of PON1 amino acid sequences constructed using data from seven 
animal species, marmoset PON1 is closer to human PON1 than it is to the PON1
orthologs of experimental animals such as pigs, rabbits, rats, and mice. Marmoset
PON1 mRNA was predominantly expressed in liver among the five tissues examined.
Marmoset PON1 protein secreted into plasma was detected by immunoblotting. The
paraoxon-hydrolyzing activity in plasma was higher in marmosets than in humans.
Based on these data, we concluded that marmoset and human PON1 have similar
characteristics with regard to genomic structure, amino acid sequences, and
tissue distribution.

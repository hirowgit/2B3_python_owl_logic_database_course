In a retrospective study of a western pygmy marmoset (Cebuella pygmaea) colony,
postmortem examination of 1/8 juvenile and 29/47 adult animals identified
vascular, cardiac, and renal lesions consistent with systemic hypertension. This 
included frequent renal arteriolar hypertrophy, hyaline and proliferative
arteriolosclerosis, fibrinoid necrosis of arterioles, glomerulosclerosis, and
nephrosclerosis. Affected animals ranged from 0.6 to 12 years of age (mean 6
years) and had an observed male predominance. Genealogical relatedness was
evident in several breeding pairs and spanned multiple generations. Concurrent
cardiac and renal disease was commonly identified, although frequently
subclinical, and both were important causes of morbidity and mortality in
affected animals. Cardiomegaly and hypertrophy were typical features and were
accompanied by left atrial thrombosis in 10 animals. Signs of heart failure
included chronic pulmonary edema in 20 cases and body cavity effusions in 17. In 
the kidneys, 19 cases had glomerular disease and hypertensive vasculopathy, and
26 cases had nephrosclerosis or glomerulosclerosis. Common extrarenal secondary
causes of hypertension were excluded by necropsy examination. The pathogenesis is
suggested to involve primary hypertension leading to renal and cardiac disease.
Elevated sympathetic activity might be an underlying factor in the frequent
development of primary systemic hypertension in the pygmy marmoset, as for the
owl monkey.

Heart failure is one of the most common causes of morbidity and mortality. Both
maturational abnormalities and age-associated cardiac pathologies contribute to
heart failure. Imaging-based assessment to discern detailed cardiac structure at 
various maturational stages is imperative for understanding mechanisms behind
cardiac growth and aging. Using multiphoton nonlinear optical microscopy (NLOM)
based label-free imaging, we investigated cardiac structural composition in a
human-relevant aging model, the common marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus).
Animals were divided into three different age groups including neonatal, young
adult and old. By devising a unique strategy for segregating collagen and myosin 
emitted second harmonic generation (SHG) signals, we performed a volumetric
assessment of collagen and total scattering tissue (collagen + myosin). Aged
marmoset hearts exhibited an increase in collagen and total scattering tissue
volume at the sites of severe tissue remodelling indicating age-related cardiac
fibrosis. Significantly low scattering tissue volume in neonatal marmoset hearts 
was attributed to a lack of binding between the myofibrils in maturing cardiac
tissue. Comprehensive quantitative assessment of structural composition during
maturation and aging of marmoset hearts revealed significant differences in
myofibril length, alignment, curvature and angular distribution. In conclusion,
label-free high-resolution NLOM facilitates visualization and quantification of
subcellular structural features for understanding vital age-related morphological
alterations in the marmoset heart.

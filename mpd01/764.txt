A specific pathogen free (SPF) barrier colony of breeding marmosets (Callithrix
jacchus) was established at the Barshop Institute for Longevity and Aging
Studies. Rodent and other animal models maintained as SPF barrier colonies have
demonstrated improved health and lengthened lifespans enhancing the quality and
repeatability of aging research. The marmosets were screened for two viruses and 
several bacterial pathogens prior to establishing the new SPF colony. Twelve
founding animals successfully established a breeding colony with increased
reproductive success, improved health parameters, and increased median lifespan
when compared to a conventionally housed, open colony. The improved health and
longevity of marmosets from the SPF barrier colony suggests that such management 
can be used to produce a unique resource for future studies of aging processes in
a nonhuman primate model.

A monkey model of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection is urgently needed to better
understand transmission and pathogenesis, given its proven association with fetal
brain defects in pregnant women and acute neurological illness. Here we
experimentally infected 4 male marmosets with ZIKV (prototype 1947 African
strain) and monitored them clinically with sampling of various body fluids and
tissues for nearly 3 months. We show that the course of acute infection with ZIKV
in these New World monkeys resembles the human illness in many respects,
including (1) lack of apparent clinical symptoms in most cases, (2) persistence
of the virus in body fluids such as semen and saliva for longer periods of time
than in serum, and (3) generation of neutralizing antibodies as well as an
antiviral immunological host response. Importantly, ZIKV-infected saliva samples 
(in addition to serum) were found to be infectious, suggesting potential capacity
for viral transmission by the oral route. Re-challenge of a previously infected
marmoset with a contemporary outbreak strain SPH2015 from Brazil resulted in
continued protection against infection, no viral shedding, and boosting of the
immune response. Given the key similarities to human infection, a marmoset model 
of ZIKV infection may be useful for testing of new drugs and vaccines.

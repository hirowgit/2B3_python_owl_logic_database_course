Since its first description, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis,
originally designated experimental allergic encephalitis (EAE), has been proposed
as animal model to investigate pathogenetic hypotheses and test new treatments in
the field of central nervous system inflammation and demyelination, which has
become, in the last 30 years, the most popular animal model of multiple sclerosis
(MS). This experimental disease can be obtained in all mammals tested so far,
including nonhuman primates, allowing very advanced preclinical studies. Its
appropriate use has led to the development of the most recent treatments approved
for MS, also demonstrating its predictive value when properly handled. Some of
the most exciting experiments validating the use of neural precursor cells (NPCs)
as a potential therapeutic option in CNS inflammation have been performed in this
model. We review here the most relevant immunological features of EAE in the
different animal species and strains, and describe detailed protocols to obtain
the three most common clinical courses of EAE in mice, with the hope to provide
both cultural and practical basis for the use of this fascinating animal model.

BACKGROUND: Animal models of human brain disorders often have to rely on
non-human primates because of their immunological, physiological, and cognitive
similarities to humans.
METHODS: Localized proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy was performed to assess
cerebral metabolite profiles of male common marmoset monkeys in vivo and to
determine putative alterations of adult brain metabolism in response to
intrauterine hyperexposure to the synthetic glucocorticoid hormone dexamethasone.
RESULTS: Excellent spectral quality allowed for absolute quantification of the
concentrations of major metabolites in predominantly white matter, gray matter,
and thalamus. Marmoset monkeys intrauterinely hyperexposed to dexamethasone
revealed normal neurochemical profiles at adulthood.
CONCLUSIONS: Prenatally applied dexamethasone does not lead to persistent
metabolic alterations affecting adult brain integrity.

The serum albumin gene family is comprised of albumin, alpha-fetoprotein,
alpha-albumin (afamin), and the more distantly related Vitamin D binding protein.
These genes arose from a common ancestor through a series of duplication events, 
are expressed primarily in the liver and tightly linked in all species where this
has been investigated. Here, we describe a fifth member of the albumin gene
family that we have named Alpha-fetoprotein Related Gene (ARG) since it exhibits 
greatest similarity to this family member. ARG is activated in the liver
perinatally, but is expressed at very low levels. The ARG gene is present and
intact in the mouse, rat, dog and horse genomes. In contrast, the ARG gene in
human, chimpanzee, rhesus monkey, and marmoset contains a number of mutations
common to all four species, indicating that this gene has been an inactive
pseudogene in primates for at least 40 million years. Low expression and aberrant
splicing of the ARG gene in the mouse liver suggests that ARG may have less
functional significance than other members of the serum albumin gene family even 
in species where it is still intact.

Non-human primates (NHPs) offer valuable animal models for basic research into
human diseases and for the preclinical validation of new therapeutics. Detailed
in situ examination of the involved cell types using immunohistochemistry is
often hampered by the lack of cross-reactive antibodies (Abs). In the current
study, we have tested a large panel of monoclonal antibodies raised against human
leukocyte differentiation and activation markers for cross-reactivity on
cryosections of lymphoid tissue from six NHP species. In total, we have tested
130 Abs against 69 antigens expressed in tissues from one great ape species
(chimpanzee/Pan troglodytes), two Old World species (rhesus macaque/Macaca
mulatta and cynomolgus macaque/Macaca fascicularis), and three New World species 
(common marmoset/Callithrix jacchus, cotton-top tamarin/Saguinus oedipus, and owl
monkey/Aotus triviogatus). We have found a large panel of cross-reactive Abs: 93 
of 102 (91%) in chimpanzee, 97 of 125 (78%) in rhesus macaque, 70 of 109 (64%) in
cynomolgus macaque, 69 of 116 (60%) in common marmoset, 40 of 81 (49%) in
cotton-top tamarin, and 35 of 80 (44%) in owl monkey. The availability of a
reliable panel of cross-reactive markers is important to gaining further insight 
into immunological processes in disease-affected tissues from NHP species.

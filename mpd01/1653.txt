BACKGROUND: The establishment of reliable methods for functional assessment in
experimental models of peripheral nerve regeneration is crucial.
METHODS: We present a straightforward method for video analysis of the eye blink 
reflex in a model of facial nerve damage in a nonhuman primate (Callithrix sp.).
RESULTS: Our 6-level dynamic analysis demonstrated good reproducibility between
independent observers, as measured by Cohen's kappa index. Our static analysis,
which was based on 4 semiautomated metric parameters, showed low correlation
during the early stage of facial movement recovery (the first and second weeks), 
but the correlation was excellent during the later stage of recovery (the third
and fourth weeks).
CONCLUSION: Altogether, our results establish a viable and readily accessible
method with good reproducibility and correlation for the analysis of functional
facial nerve recovery in an experimental model and based on video images of the
eye blink reflex.

BACKGROUND: The wearing-OFF phenomenon is a common motor complication of chronic 
L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) therapy for Parkinson's disease. We
recently described the discovery of UWA-101, a dual serotonin (SERT) and dopamine
(DAT) transporter inhibitor, which increases the duration of "good quality"
ON-time provided by L-DOPA in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine
(MPTP)-lesioned primate. Here, we further characterise the effects of UWA-101 on 
this extension of ON-time in terms of L-DOPA-induced side-effects in the
MPTP-lesioned common marmoset.
METHODS: Marmosets were rendered parkinsonian by MPTP injection and "primed" by
repeated L-DOPA administration, to exhibit dyskinesia and psychosis-like
behaviours. Animals were then administered acute challenges of L-DOPA in
combination with UWA-101 (1, 3, 6 and 10 mg/kg) or vehicle.
RESULTS: In combination with L-DOPA, UWA-101 (3, 6 and 10 mg/kg) significantly
increased duration of ON-time (by 28%, 28%, and 33%, respectively; all P<0.05).
UWA-101 (10 mg/kg) significantly extended duration of ON-time without disabling
dyskinesia (by 62%, P<0.01). UWA-101 did not exacerbate the severity of
dyskinesia (P>0.05). However, at the highest doses (6 and 10 mg/kg), UWA-101
increased the severity of psychosis-like behaviours (P<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that dual SERT/ DAT inhibitors can
effectively enhance L-DOPA anti-parkinsonian action, without exacerbating
dyskinesia and, as such, represent a promising new therapeutic class for
wearing-OFF. However, at higher doses, dual SERT/ DAT inhibitors may exacerbate
dopaminergic psychosis.

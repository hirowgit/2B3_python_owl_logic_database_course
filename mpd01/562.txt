High-acuity vision in primates, including humans, is mediated by a small central 
retinal region called the fovea. As more accessible organisms lack a fovea, its
specialized function and its dysfunction in ocular diseases remain poorly
understood. We used 165,000 single-cell RNA-seq profiles to generate
comprehensive cellular taxonomies of macaque fovea and peripheral retina. More
than 80% of >60 cell types match between the two regions but exhibit substantial 
differences in proportions and gene expression, some of which we relate to
functional differences. Comparison of macaque retinal types with those of mice
reveals that interneuron types are tightly conserved. In contrast, projection
neuron types and programs diverge, despite exhibiting conserved transcription
factor codes. Key macaque types are conserved in humans, allowing mapping of
cell-type and region-specific expression of >190 genes associated with 7 human
retinal diseases. Our work provides a framework for comparative single-cell
analysis across tissue regions and species.

Response inhibition (inhibiting prepotent responses) is needed for reaching a
more favourable goal in situations where reacting automatically would be
detrimental. Inhibiting prepotent responses to resist the temptation of a
stimulus in certain situations, such as a novel food item, can directly affect an
animal's survival. In humans and dogs, response inhibition varies between
contexts and between individuals. We used two contextually different experiments 
to investigate response inhibition in the eastern water skink (Eulamprus quoyii):
reversal of a visual two-choice discrimination and a cylinder detour task. During
the two-choice task, half of our lizards were able to reach an initial learning
criterion, but, thereafter, did not show consistent performance. Only two
individuals reached a more stringent criterion, but subsequently failed during
reversals. Furthermore, half of our animals were not able to inhibit a
pre-existing side preference which affected their ability to learn during the
two-choice task. Skinks were, however, able to achieve a detour around a cylinder
performing at levels comparable to brown lemurs, marmosets, and some parrot
species. A comparison between the tasks showed that reaching the initial
criterion was associated with low success during the detour task, indicating that
response inhibition could be context-specific in the water skink. To the best of 
our knowledge, this is the first study to examine inhibitory control and motor
self-regulation in a lizard species.

BACKGROUND: A survey was developed to characterize disease incidence, common
pathology lesions, environmental characteristics, and nutrition programs within
captive research marmoset colonies.
METHODS: Seventeen research facilities completed the electronic survey.
RESULTS: Nutritional management programs varied amongst research institutions
housing marmosets; eight primary base diets were reported. The most common
clinical syndromes reported were gastrointestinal disease (i.e. inflammatory
bowel disease like disease, chronic lymphocytic enteritis, chronic malabsorption,
chronic diarrhea), metabolic bone disease or fracture, infectious diarrhea, and
oral disease (tooth root abscesses, gingivitis, tooth root resorption). The five 
most common pathology morphologic diagnoses were colitis, nephropathy/nephritis, 
enteritis, chronic lymphoplasmacytic enteritis, and cholecystitis. Obesity was
more common (average 20% of a reporting institution's population) than thin body 
condition (average 5%).
CONCLUSIONS: Through review of current practices, we aim to inspire development
of evidence-based practices to standardize husbandry and nutrition practices for 
marmoset research colonies.

Episodic memory decline is an early marker of cognitive aging in human. Although 
controversial in animals and called "episodic-like memory", several models have
been successfully developed, however they rarely focused on ageing. While
marmoset is an emerging primate model in aging science, episodic-like memory has 
never been tested in this species and importantly in aged marmosets. Here, we
examined if the recall of the what-when and what-where building blocks of
episodic-like memory declines in ageing marmosets. We developed a naturalistic
approach using spontaneous exploration of real objects by young and old marmosets
in the home cage. We implemented a three-trial task with 1 week inter-trial
interval. Two different sets of identical objects were presented in sample trials
1 and 2, respectively. For the test trial, two objects from each set were
presented in a former position and two in a new one. We quantified the
exploratory behaviour and calculated discrimination indices in a cohort of 20
marmosets. Young animals presented a preserved memory for combined what-where,
and what-when components of the experiment, which declined with aging. These
findings lead one to expect episodic-like memory deficits in aged marmosets.

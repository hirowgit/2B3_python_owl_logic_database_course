Pitch perception is critical for identifying and segregating auditory objects,
especially in the context of music and speech. The perception of pitch is not
unique to humans and has been experimentally demonstrated in several animal
species. Pitch is the subjective attribute of a sound's fundamental frequency
(f(0)) that is determined by both the temporal regularity and average repetition 
rate of its acoustic waveform. Spectrally dissimilar sounds can have the same
pitch if they share a common f(0). Even when the acoustic energy at f(0) is
removed ('missing fundamental') the same pitch is still perceived. Despite its
importance for hearing, how pitch is represented in the cerebral cortex is
unknown. Here we show the existence of neurons in the auditory cortex of marmoset
monkeys that respond to both pure tones and missing fundamental harmonic complex 
sounds with the same f(0), providing a neural correlate for pitch constancy.
These pitch-selective neurons are located in a restricted low-frequency cortical 
region near the anterolateral border of the primary auditory cortex, and is
consistent with the location of a pitch-selective area identified in recent
imaging studies in humans.

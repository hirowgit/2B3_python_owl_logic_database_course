Old World monkeys, apes and humans all enjoy trichromatic colour vision, and the 
absorption spectra of the photopigments are very similar in all species and all
individuals. Colour vision in New World monkeys however, is very heterogeneous.
In many species, the majority of individuals is dichromatic. Recently, anatomical
and electrophysiological studies revealed that the retinal organisation in Old
World monkeys and New World monkeys is very similar, although the cells belonging
to the parvocellular pathway do not show any colour opponency and their spectral 
sensitivity is similar to that of the magnocellular cells. Apparently, the
magnocellular and parvocellular pathways in the retina and the LGN have not
developed as an adaptation to luminance and chromatic processing. It is more
likely that the two pathways originally evolved to cover different ranges in the 
spatio-temporal domain. In the present paper, several spatial and temporal
properties of parvo- and magnocellular cells (which are identical for dichromatic
and trichromatic animals) are compared.

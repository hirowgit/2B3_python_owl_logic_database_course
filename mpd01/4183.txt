Six strains of serotypes 1 or 2 of Y. pseudotuberculosis were isolated from dead 
squirrel monkeys, a cotton-top tamarin and a marmoset hybrid. All strains
harboured a 71.6 kb plasmid, all were totally oxacillin-resistant and partially
resistant to cephalosporins. Biochemically, serotypes 1 and 2 differed from each 
other in their beta-galactosidase production in a nonfermenter system, whereas
the lack of rhamnose, maltose, salicin and trehalose fermentation seemed to be
attributable to technical causes.

An experimental study undertaken in the marmoset is reported. A defect in the
lateral cord of the brachial plexus was repaired with a longitudinally aligned
freeze-thawed skeletal muscle autograft. Recovery was assessed after one year
using sensory and motor electrophysiological and also histological examination of
the nerve. The results show that this is a satisfactory method of peripheral
nerve repair in the marmoset. It is suggested that the technique may be
applicable to repair of the human brachial plexus.

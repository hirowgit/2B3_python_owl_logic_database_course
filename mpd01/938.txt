Given the strong coupling between the substantia nigra (SN) and striatum (STR) in
the early stage of Parkinson's disease (PD), yet only a few studies reported to
date that have simultaneously investigated the neurochemistry of these two brain 
regions in vivo, we performed longitudinal metabolic profiling in the SN and STR 
of 1-methyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-intoxicated common marmoset monkey 
models of PD (n = 10) by using proton MRS (1 H-MRS) at 9.4 T. T2 relaxometry was 
also performed in the SN by using MRI. Data were classified into control,
MPTP_2weeks, and MPTP_6-10 weeks groups according to the treatment duration. In
the SN, T2 of the MPTP_6-10 weeks group was lower than that of the control group 
(44.33 ± 1.75 versus 47.21 ± 2.47 ms, p < 0.05). The N-acetylaspartate to total
creatine ratio (NAA/tCr) and γ-aminobutyric acid to tCr ratio (GABA/tCr) of the
MPTP_6-10 weeks group were lower than those of the control group (0.41 ± 0.04
versus 0.54 ± 0.08 (p < 0.01) and 0.19 ± 0.03 versus 0.30 ± 0.09 (p < 0.05),
respectively). The glutathione to tCr ratio (GSH/tCr) was correlated with T2 for 
the MPTP_6-10 weeks group (r = 0.83, p = 0.04). In the STR, however, GABA/tCr of 
the MPTP_6-10 weeks group was higher than that of the control group (0.25 ± 0.10 
versus 0.16 ± 0.05, p < 0.05). These findings may be an in vivo depiction of the 
altered basal ganglion circuit in PD brain resulting from the degeneration of
nigral dopaminergic neurons and disruption of nigrostriatal dopaminergic
projections. Given the important role of non-human primates in translational
studies, our findings provide better understanding of the complicated evolution
of PD.

Schlafen11 (encoded by the SLFN11 gene) has been shown to inhibit the
accumulation of HIV-1 proteins. We show that the SLFN11 gene is under positive
selection in simian primates and is species-specific in its activity against
HIV-1. The activity of human Schlafen11 is relatively weak compared to that of
some other primate versions of this protein, with the versions encoded by
chimpanzee, orangutan, gibbon, and marmoset being particularly potent inhibitors 
of HIV-1 protein production. Interestingly, we find that Schlafen11 is functional
in the absence of infection and reduces protein production from certain non-viral
(GFP) and even host (Vinculin and GAPDH) transcripts. This suggests that
Schlafen11 may just generally block protein production from non-codon optimized
transcripts. Because Schlafen11 is an interferon-stimulated gene with a broad
ability to inhibit protein production from many host and viral transcripts, its
role may be to create a general antiviral state in the cell. Interestingly, the
strong inhibitors such as marmoset Schlafen11 consistently block protein
production better than weak primate Schlafen11 proteins, regardless of the virus 
or host target being analyzed. Further, we show that the residues to which
species-specific differences in Schlafen11 potency map are distinct from residues
that have been targeted by positive selection. We speculate that the positive
selection of SLFN11 could have been driven by a number of different factors,
including interaction with one or more viral antagonists that have yet to be
identified.

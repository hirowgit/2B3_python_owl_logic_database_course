The common marmoset is widely used in neuroscience and regenerative medicine
research. However, information concerning common marmoset disorders, particularly
infectious diseases, is scarce. Here, we report a case of a female common
marmoset that died suddenly due to gas gangrene. The animal presented with
gaseous abdominal distention at postmortem, and Clostridium perfringens type A
was isolated from several tissues. Vacuoles, a Gram-positive bacteremia and
intravascular hemolysis were observed microscopically in the muscles, liver and
lungs. On the basis of these findings, we diagnosed nontraumatic gas gangrene
caused by Clostridium perfringens type A in this common marmoset.

The visual brain is composed of interconnected subcortical and cortical
structures that receive and process image information originating in the retina. 
The visual system of nonhuman primates, in particular macaques, has been studied 
in great detail in order to elucidate principles of human sensation and
perception. The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a small New World monkey 
of growing interest as a primate model for neuroscience. Marmosets have
advantages over macaques because of their small size, lissencephalic cortex, and 
growing potential for viral and genetic manipulations. Previous anatomical
studies and electrophysiological recordings in anesthetized marmosets have shown 
that this species' cortical visual hierarchy closely resembles that of other
primates, including humans. Until now, however, there have been no attempts to
systematically study visual responses throughout the marmoset brain using fMRI.
Here we show that awake marmosets readily learn to carry out a simple visual task
inside the bore of an MRI scanner during functional mapping experiments.
Functional scanning at 500 Î¼m in-plane resolution in a 30 cm horizontal bore at 7
T revealed robust positive blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI
responses to visual stimuli throughout visual cortex and associated subcortical
areas. Nonvisual sensory areas showed negative contrasts to visual stimuli
compared to the fixation dot only baseline. Structured images of objects and
faces led to stronger responses than scrambled control images at stages beyond
early visual cortex. Our study establishes fMRI mapping of visual responses in
awake, behaving marmosets as a straightforward and valuable tool for assessing
the functional organization of the primate brain at high resolution.

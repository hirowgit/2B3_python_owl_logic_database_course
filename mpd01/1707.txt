The development of biologic molecules (monoclonal antibodies, cytokines, soluble 
receptors) as specific therapeutics for human disease creates a need for animal
models in which safety and efficacy can be tested. Models in lower animal species
are precluded when the reagents fail to recognize their targets, which is often
the case in rats and mice. In this Feature article we will highlight the common
marmoset, a small-bodied nonhuman primate (NHP), as a useful model in biomedical 
and preclinical translational research.

We have systematically studied the effects of varying the central unnatural amino
acid moiety on CGRP receptor antagonist potency and CYP inhibition in a series of
ureidoamides. In this Letter, we report the discovery of compound 23, a potent
CGRP receptor antagonist with only weak CYP3A4 inhibition. Unlike the triptans,
compound 23 did not cause active constriction of ex vivo human cerebral arteries.
At doses of 0.3-1 mg/kg (s.c.), 23 showed robust inhibition of CGRP-induced
increases in marmoset facial blood flow, a validated migraine model. Ureidoamide 
23 derives from a novel amino acid, 1H-indazol-5-yl substituted alanine as a
tyrosine surrogate.

Even after birth, neuronal production continues in the ventricular-subventricular
zone (V-SVZ) and hippocampus in many mammals. The immature new neurons
("neuroblasts") migrate and then mature at their final destination. In humans,
neuroblast production and migration toward the neocortex and the olfactory bulb
(OB) occur actively only for a few months after birth and then sharply decline
with age. However, the precise spatiotemporal profiles and fates of postnatally
born neurons remain unclear due to methodological limitations. We previously
found that common marmosets, small nonhuman primates, share many features of
V-SVZ organization with humans. Here, using marmosets injected with thymidine
analogue(s) during various postnatal periods, we demonstrated spatiotemporal
changes in neurogenesis during development. V-SVZ progenitor proliferation and
neuroblast migration toward the OB and neocortex sharply decreased by 4 months,
most strikingly in a V-SVZ subregion from which neuroblasts migrated toward the
neocortex. Postnatally born neurons matured within a few months in the OB and
hippocampus but remained immature until 6 months in the neocortex. While
neurogenic activity was sustained for a month after birth, the distribution
and/or differentiation diversity was more restricted in 1-month-born cells than
in the neonatal-born population. These findings shed light on distinctive
features of postnatal neurogenesis in primates.

Marmoset monkeys show high levels of proactive prosociality, a trait shared with 
humans, presumably because both species rely on allomaternal care. However, it is
not clear whether the proximate regulation of this convergent trait is also
similar, in particular with regard to intentionality, which is a defining
characteristic of prosocial behavior in the human literature. The aim of this
paper was to investigate whether marmoset monkeys' prosociality fulfils the
criteria of intentionality developed in primate communication research. The
results show that marmoset prosocial behavior (i) has some degree of flexibility,
since individuals can use multiple means to reach their goal and adjust them to
specific conditions, (ii) depends on the presence of an audience, i.e. potential 
recipients (social use), and (iii) is goal-directed, because (a) it continues
exactly until the putative goal is reached, and (b) individuals check back and
look at/for their partner when their prosocial actions do not achieve the
putative goal (i.e. if their actions don't lead to the expected outcome, this
elicits distinct reactions in the actor). These results suggest that marmoset
prosociality is under some degree of voluntary, intentional control. They are in 
line with other findings that marmosets perceive each other as intentional
agents, and only learn socially from actions that are perceived as intentional.
The most parsimonious conclusion is, therefore, that prosocial behavior is
fundamentally under voluntary control in marmosets, just as it is in humans, even
though our more sophisticated cognitive abilities allow for a far more complex
integration of prosociality into a broader variety of contexts and of behavioral 
goals.

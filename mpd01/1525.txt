BACKGROUND: The acute abdomen is any abdominal disorder resulting in pain, shock,
or sepsis. Although it has a multifactorial etiology, the primary cause is
gastrointestinal tract pathology. The aim of this study was to assess the
contribution of abdominal ultrasound as a complementary diagnostic tool in
non-human primates with an acute abdomen.
METHODS: Three different non-human primates with clinical signs of acute abdomen 
were evaluated as follows: a chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), a tufted capuchin
(Cebus apella), and a black-tufted marmoset (Callithrix penicillata).
RESULTS: Ultrasonographic examination assisted in the identification of a variety
of differential diagnoses and was used in decision-making for exploratory
laparotomy, which was performed in two animals. Ultrasound examination confirmed 
the source of the acute abdomen as the gastrointestinal tract in the three
animals studied.
CONCLUSIONS: Abdominal ultrasound is a useful technique for the investigation of 
signs of acute abdomen in non-human primates.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is now widely used in various research
fields, including toxicology. However, information about the background pathology
of this species is scarce. Here, we report a case of rhabdomyosarcoma that
spontaneously occurred in a common marmoset. A 44-month-old male common marmoset 
was euthanized due to bilateral hind limb paralysis. At necropsy, a 2×2×5-cm
intramuscular mass was observed in the lower right back. Histologically, the mass
was mainly composed of interlacing bundles of spindle-shaped tumor cells.
Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were positive for myogenin, desmin,
vimentin and alpha-smooth muscle actin. Ultrastructurally, the tumor cells
contained bundles of myofilaments with Z-band-like structures. Thus, the tumor
was diagnosed as a rhabdomyosarcoma. To our knowledge, this is the first report
of spontaneous rhabdomyosarcoma that was definitely diagnosed in the common
marmoset.

Mammalian captive dietary specialists like folivores are prone to
gastrointestinal distress and primate dietary specialists suffer the greatest gut
microbiome diversity losses in captivity compared to the wild. Marmosets
represent another group of dietary specialists, exudivores that eat plant
exudates, but whose microbiome remains relatively less studied. The common
occurrence of gastrointestinal distress in captive marmosets prompted us to study
the Callithrix gut microbiome composition and predictive function through
bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA V4 region sequencing. We sampled 59 wild and captive 
Callithrix across four species and their hybrids. Host environment had a stronger
effect on the gut microbiome than host taxon. Wild Callithrix gut microbiomes
were enriched for Bifidobacterium, which process host-indigestible carbohydrates.
Captive marmoset guts were enriched for Enterobacteriaceae, a family containing
pathogenic bacteria. While gut microbiome function was similar across marmosets, 
Enterobacteriaceae seem to carry out most functional activities in captive host
guts. More diverse bacterial taxa seem to perform gut functions in wild
marmosets, with Bifidobacterium being important for carbohydrate metabolism.
Captive marmosets showed gut microbiome composition aspects seen in human
gastrointestinal diseases. Thus, captivity may perturb the exudivore gut
microbiome, which raises implications for captive exudivore welfare and calls for
husbandry modifications.

Fatal Human Alphaherpesvirus 1 Infection in Free-Ranging Black-Tufted Marmosets

Human alphaherpesvirus 1 (HuAHV1) causes fatal neurologic infections in captive
New World primates. To determine risks for interspecies transmission, we examined
data for 13 free-ranging, black-tufted marmosets (Callithrix penicillata) that
died of HuAHV1 infection and had been in close contact with humans in anthropized
areas in Brazil during 2012-2019. We evaluated pathologic changes in the
marmosets, localized virus and antigen, and assessed epidemiologic features. The 
main clinical findings were neurologic signs, necrotizing meningoencephalitis,
and ulcerative glossitis; 1 animal had necrotizing hepatitis. Transmission
electron microscopy revealed intranuclear herpetic inclusions, and immunostaining
revealed HuAHV1 and herpesvirus particles in neurons, glial cells, tongue mucosal
epithelium, and hepatocytes. PCR confirmed HuAHV1 infection. These findings
illustrate how disruption of the One Health equilibrium in anthropized
environments poses risks for interspecies virus transmission with potential
spillover not only from animals to humans but also from humans to free-ranging
nonhuman primates or other animals.

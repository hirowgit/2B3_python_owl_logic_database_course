Background: Primary human hepatocytes (PHHs) are the ideal candidates for
studying critical liver functions such as drug metabolism and toxicity. However, 
as they are isolated from discarded livers that are unsuitable for
transplantation, they possess limited expansion ability in vitro and their
enzymatic functions deteriorate rapidly because they are often of poor quality.
Therefore, there is a compelling reason to find reliable alternative sources of
hepatocytes.
Methods: In this study, we report on efficient and robust differentiation of
embryonic stem cells (ESC) from the common marmoset Callithrix jacchus into
functional hepatocyte-like cells (HLC) using a simple, and reproducible
three-step procedure. ESC-derived HLCs were examined by morphological analysis
and tested for their expression of hepatocyte-specific markers using a
combination of immunohistochemistry, RT-PCR, and biochemical assays. Primary
human hepatocytes were used as controls.
Results: ESC-derived HLCs expressed each of the hepatocyte-specific markers
tested, including albumin; α-fetoprotein; asialoglycoprotein receptor 1; α-1
antitrypsin; hepatocyte nuclear factors 1α and 4; cytokeratin 18; hepatocyte
growth factor receptor; transferrin; tyrosine aminotransferase; alkaline
phosphatase; c-reactive protein; cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP1A2, CYP2E1 and
CYP3A4; and coagulation factors FVII and FIX. They were functionally competent as
demonstrated by biochemical assays in addition to producing urea.
Conclusion: Our data strongly suggest that marmoset HLCs possess characteristics 
similar to those of PHHs. They could, therefore, be invaluable for studies on
drug metabolism and cell transplantation therapy for a variety of liver
disorders. Because of the similarities in the anatomical and physiological
features of the common marmoset to that of humans, Callithrix jacchus is an
appropriate animal model to study human disease conditions and cellular
functions.

Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) G2019S is a relatively common mutation,
associated with 1-3% of Parkinson's disease (PD) cases worldwide. G2019S is
hypothesized to increase LRRK2 kinase activity. Dopaminergic neurons derived from
induced pluripotent stem cells of PD patients carrying LRRK2 G2019S are reported 
to have several phenotypes compared to wild type controls, including increased
activated caspase-3 and reactive oxygen species (ROS), autophagy dysfunction, and
simplification of neurites. The common marmoset is envisioned as a candidate
nonhuman primate species for comprehensive modeling of genetic mutations. Here,
we report our successful use of CRISPR/Cas9 with repair template-mediated
homology directed repair to introduce the LRRK2 G2019S mutation, as well as a
truncation of the LRRK2 kinase domain, into marmoset embryonic and induced
pluripotent stem cells. We found that, similar to humans, marmoset LRRK2 G2019S
resulted in elevated kinase activity. Phenotypic evaluation after dopaminergic
differentiation demonstrated LRRK2 G2019S-mediated increased intracellular ROS,
decreased neuronal viability, and reduced neurite complexity. Importantly, these 
phenotypes were not observed in clones with LRRK2 truncation. These results
demonstrate the feasibility of inducing monogenic mutations in common marmosets
and support the use of this species for generating a novel genetic-based model of
PD that expresses physiological levels of LRRK2 G2019S.

Olfactory cues can exert priming effects on many mammalian species. Paternally
experienced marmosets, Callithrix jacchus, exposed to direct isolated olfactory
contact with their own infant's scent show rapid decreases in testosterone levels
within 20 min, whereas paternally inexperienced males do not. The following study
tests whether there is a differential steroid response to exposure of infant
scent from dependent infants (own and novel) and independent infants (own and
novel). We examined the serum levels of estradiol, estrone, testosterone,
dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and combined estrogens and androgens in eight male
marmosets 20 min after exposure to isolated infant scent. Testosterone and
androgen levels combined were significantly lower with exposure to own infant
scent than a novel infant scent when the infants were at a dependent age but not 
at an independent age. Estrogen levels elevated significantly in response to own 
infant scent when the infants were at a dependent age but not at an independent
age. These results suggest that marmoset fathers are more responsive to priming
cues from related infants and hormonal responses from fathers are greatest when
the infant is at a dependent age.

Phthalates are the most widely used plasticisers in the world and have been in
medical use since 1955. Di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) is present in many
industrial and domestic products, and is a common plasticiser used in blood bags 
and tubing sets. Concerns have been raised by environmental groups that DEHP
exposure may result in gender birth defects and the feminisation of boys although
there were no studies performed of intravenous exposure to DEHP on higher mammals
or humans which report similar effects. This article reports on the toxicology of
DEHP and considers concerns regarding its use in the context of transfusion
medicine. The benefits of using DEHP are evaluated and the use of alternative
plasticisers to DEHP is explored. The article reports on international and
European regulatory recommendations for DEHP use in transfusion medicine and
examines the impact of legislation on the medical devices and blood industries.
The article also reviews labelling considerations for blood components and offers
some guidance for blood establishments in respect of DEHP use.

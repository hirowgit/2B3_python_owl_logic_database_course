Advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) is often complicated by the occurrence of
dyskinesia, motor fluctuations and psychosis. To this day, few treatment options 
are available for each of these phenomena, and they are at times not effective or
elicit adverse events, leaving some patients short of therapeutic options. We
have recently shown that positive allosteric modulation of metabotropic 2 (mGlu2)
receptors with the prototypical positive allosteric modulator (PAM) LY-487,379 is
efficacious at alleviating both dyskinesia and psychosis-like behaviours (PLBs), 
while simultaneously enhancing the anti-parkinsonian action of
L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA), in the
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-lesioned marmoset. Here, we
assessed the effects of CBiPES, a mGlu2 PAM derived from LY-487,379, but with
improved pharmacokinetic properties. Six MPTP-lesioned marmosets with
reproducible dyskinesia and PLBs were administered L-DOPA in combination with
vehicle or CBiPES (0.1, 1 and 10 mg/kg), after which their behaviour was rated.
CBiPES 10 mg/kg reduced global dyskinesia by 60% (P < 0.0001), while peak dose
dyskinesia was reduced by 66% (P < 0.001), compared to L-DOPA/vehicle. CBiPES
10 mg/kg also diminished global PLBs by 56% (P < 0.0001), while peak dose PLBs
were reduced by 64% (P < 0.001), compared to L-DOPA/vehicle. Lastly, CBiPES
enhanced the anti-parkinsonian action of L-DOPA, by reducing global parkinsonian 
disability by 43% (P < 0.01), compared to L-DOPA/vehicle. Our results provide
further evidence that mGlu2 positive allosteric modulation may be an approach
that could be efficacious for the treatment of dyskinesia, psychosis and motor
fluctuations in PD.

Obtaining a good prior for the linear pharmacokinetics of new monoclonal
antibodies (mAbs) would be an advantage not only for designing first-in-human
(FIH) studies but also for stabilizing fitting of data with non-linear
target-mediated disposition models. We estimated the pharmacokinetics from FIH
studies for five mAbs using a two-compartment model, both separately and
together, using a simple pool, a third hierarchical level of random effects for
between mAb differences and non-human-primate half-lives as a predictor covariate
for said differences. There was good agreement between compounds for the rapidly 
accessible central volume of 2.9 L (70 kg human), but clearances and peripheral
volumes differed with terminal half-lives ranging from 15 to 28 days. The simple 
pool of human studies gave inter-individual variability estimates of 32%
coefficient of variation (CV) for clearance and 33% CV for peripheral volume,
larger than for separate fits (13-26% CV and 15-35% CV for clearance and volume
respectively). Using third level hierarchical random effects gave
inter-individual variability estimates close to those of separate fits (24% and
16% CV respectively). The between-mAb differences became predictable if non-human
primate body weight scaled terminal half-life estimates were included as
covariates on clearance and peripheral volume. In conclusion, ignoring inter-mAb 
variation leads to inflated estimates of inter-individual variability and
unrealistic simulations for FIH studies. However, by using 70 kg body weight
scaled terminal half-life estimates from non-human primates one can account for
between-mAb differences and provide non-inflated priors for the linear
pharmacokinetic parameters of new mAbs.

The directed differentiation of pluripotent stem cells to a desired lineage often
involves complex and lengthy protocols. In order to study the requirements for
differentiation in a systematic way, we present here methodology for an iterative
approach using combinations of small molecules and biological factors. The
factors are used in a cyclical process in which the best combination of factors
and concentrations is selected in one round of testing, followed by a
modification of the combination and subsequent rounds. While this may produce the
desired differentiation in the cell population under study, it is also possible
that other strategies may be needed to optimize the differentiation process.
These strategies are described in this chapter.

Limited access to primary tissue from various nonhuman primate (NHP) species
represents a significant unmet need that hampers progress in understanding unique
cellular diversity and gene regulation of specific tissues and organs in stem
cell translational research. Most comparative biology studies have been limited
to using postmortem tissue usually frozen specimens with limited utility for
research. The generation of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines from
somatic cells, such as adult skin or blood cells, offers an alternative to
invasive and ethically controversial interventions for acquiring tissue.
Pluripotent iPSCs have virtually an unlimited capacity to proliferate and
differentiate into all cell types of the body. We are generating high-quality
validated NHP iPSC lines to offer to scientific community and facilitate their
research programs. We use the non-integrative episomal vector system to generate 
iPSCs from NHP skin biopsies. In this chapter we describe the validation of NHP
iPSC lines by confirming pluripotency and their propensity to differentiate into 
all three germ layers ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm according to established
standards and measurable limits for a set of marker genes incorporated into a
scorecard.

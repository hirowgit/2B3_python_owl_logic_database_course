OBJECTIVE: Investigate a combination of two clinically tested drugs, the NR2B
antagonist Radiprodil and the A2A antagonist Tozadenant in the MPTP-treated
marmoset model of Parkinson's Disease (PD).
BACKGROUND: In PD, there remains a need for the development of non-dopaminergic
drugs to effectively treat the motor symptoms without the induction of
L-Dopa-induced motor complications.
METHODS: Clinically relevant doses of Radiprodil and Tozadenant were given both
alone and in combination without the addition of L-Dopa, and the antiparkinsonian
efficacy of the treatments was assessed in a primate model of PD.
RESULTS: When compared to the drugs tested alone, the drug combination led to a
significant increase of motor activity and an improvement of motor disability in 
MPTP-treated marmosets. In addition, the motor restoration brought about by the
combination was almost completely devoid of dyskinesia. Interestingly, treated
primates were not overstimulated, but were able to move normally when motivated
by the exploration of novel objects.
CONCLUSION: We have demonstrated in a primate model that, the
"Radiprodil/Tozadenant" combination significantly improves motor activity,
extending previous results obtained in unilaterally lesioned 6-OHDA-rats. The
strength of the preclinical data accumulated so far suggests that the use of such
an A2A and NR2B antagonist combination could bring significant motor improvement 
to PD patients, without inducing the motor complications induced by L-Dopa
therapy. Although encouraging, these preclinical data need to be confirmed in the
clinic.

Using a systematic investigation of brain blood volume, in high-resolution
synchrotron 3D images of microvascular structures within cortical regions of a
primate brain, we challenge several basic questions regarding possible vascular
bias in high-resolution functional neuroimaging. We present a bilateral
comparison of cortical regions, where we analyze relative vascular volume in
voxels from 150 to 1000 μm side lengths in the white and grey matter. We show
that, if voxel size reaches a scale smaller than 300 µm, the vascular volume can 
no longer be considered homogeneous, either within one hemisphere or in bilateral
comparison between samples. We demonstrate that voxel size influences the
comparison between vessel-relative volume distributions depending on the scale
considered (i.e., hemisphere, lobe, or sample). Furthermore, we also investigate 
how voxel anisotropy and orientation can affect the apparent vascular volume, in 
accordance with actual fMRI voxel sizes. These findings are discussed from the
various perspectives of high-resolution brain functional imaging. Hum Brain Mapp

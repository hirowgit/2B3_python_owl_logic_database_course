Virologic surveillance is a critical component of measles management. One of the 
criteria for verification of elimination of endemic measles is genetic analysis
of wild-type viruses to demonstrate lack of an indigenous genotype. Measles is
yet to be eliminated in China, and genotype H1 has been detected continuously
since virologic surveillance was initiated in 1993. Virologic surveillance has
been very active in China, providing a unique opportunity to conduct a detailed
study of the evolution of a single, endemic genotype over a timespan of nearly
two decades. Phylogenetic analysis performed on the 450 nt coding sequence for
the C-terminal 150 amino acids of the nucleoprotein (N-450), fusion (F) gene and 
haemagglutinin (H) gene confirmed the continued circulation of genotype H1
viruses for 19 years. No evidence of selective pressure for the H protein was
found. The substitution rates ranged from 0.75×10(-3) substitutions site(-1)
year(-1) for H to 1.65×10(-3) substitutions site(-1) year(-1) for N-450. The time
of most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) for genotype H1 was estimated as
approximately 1985 (95 % highest probability density, 1979-1989). Finally, the
overall diversity of measles sequences from China decreased from 2005 to 2012,
coincident with a substantial decrease in measles cases. The results suggest that
detailed evolutionary analyses should facilitate the documentation of eventual
measles elimination in China. Moreover, the molecular approaches used in this
study can be applied in other countries approaching measles elimination.

Small RNAs mediate gene silencing by binding Argonaute/Piwi proteins to regulate 
target RNAs. Here, we describe small RNA profiling of the adult testes of
Callithrix jacchus, the common marmoset. The most abundant class of small RNAs in
the adult testis was piRNAs, although 353 novel miRNAs but few endo-siRNAs were
also identified. MARWI, a marmoset homolog of mouse MIWI and a very abundant PIWI
in adult testes, associates with piRNAs that show characteristics of mouse
pachytene piRNAs. As in other mammals, most marmoset piRNAs are derived from
conserved clustered regions in the genome, which are annotated as intergenic
regions. However, unlike in mice, marmoset piRNA clusters are also found on the X
chromosome, suggesting escape from meiotic sex chromosome inactivation by the
X-linked clusters. Some of the piRNA clusters identified contain
antisense-orientated pseudogenes, suggesting the possibility that
pseudogene-derived piRNAs may regulate parental functional protein-coding genes. 
More piRNAs map to transposable element (TE) subfamilies when they have copies in
piRNA clusters. In addition, the strand bias observed for piRNAs mapped to each
TE subfamily correlates with the polarity of copies inserted in clusters. These
findings suggest that pachytene piRNA clusters determine the abundance and
strand-bias of TE-derived piRNAs, may regulate protein-coding genes via
pseudogene-derived piRNAs, and may even play roles in meiosis in the adult
marmoset testis.

We report a preclinical study of a pyrrole-imidazole (PI) polyamide that targets 
the human transforming growth factor (hTGF)-β1 gene as a novel transcriptional
gene silencer in a common marmoset primate model. We designed and then
synthesized PI polyamides to target the hTGF-β1 promoter. We examined effects of 
seven PI polyamides (GB1101-1107) on the expression of hTGF-β1 mRNA stimulated
with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) in human vascular smooth muscle cells.
GB1101, GB1105 and GB1106 significantly inhibited hTGF-β1 mRNA expression. We
examined GB1101 as a PI polyamide to hTGF-β1 for hypertrophic scars in marmosets 
in vivo. Injection of GB1101 completely inhibited hypertrophic scar formation at 
35 days post-incision and inhibited cellular infiltration, TGF-β1 and vimentin
staining, and epidermal thickness. Mismatch polyamide did not affect hypertrophic
scarring or histological changes. Epidermis was significantly thinner with GB1101
than with water and mismatch PI polyamides. We developed the PI polyamides for
practical ointment medicines for the treatment of hypertrophic scars.
FITC-labeled GB1101 with solbase most efficiently distributed in the nuclei of
epidermal keratinocytes, completely suppressed hypertropic scarring at 42 days
after incision, and considerably inhibited epidermal thickness and
vimentin-positive fibroblasts. PI polyamides targeting hTGF-β1 promoter with
solbase ointment will be practical medicines for treating hypertrophic scars
after surgical operations and skin burns.

Research aimed at developing new therapies for Parkinson's disease (PD)
critically depend on valid animal models of the disease that allows for repeated 
testing of motor disabilities over extended time periods. We here present an
extensive characterization of a wide range of motor symptoms in the 6-OHDA
marmoset model of PD when tested over several months. The severity of motor
deficits was quantified in two ways: (i) through manual scoring protocols
appropriately adapted to include species specific motor behavior and (ii) using
automated quantitative motion tracking based on image processing of the digital
video recordings. We show that the automated methods allow for rapid and reliable
characterization of motor dysfunctions, thus complementing the manual scoring
procedures, and that robust motor symptoms lasting for several months could be
induced when using a two-stage neurotoxic lesioning procedure involving one
hemisphere at a time. This non-human primate model of PD should therefore be well
suited for long-term evaluation of novel therapies for treatment of PD.

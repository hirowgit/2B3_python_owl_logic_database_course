The importance of marmosets for comparative and translational science has grown
in recent years because of their relatively rapid development, birth cohorts of
twins, family social structure, and genetic tractability. Despite this, they
remain understudied in investigations of affective processes. In this
methodological note, we establish the validity of using noninvasive commercially 
available equipment to record cardiac physiology and compute indices of autonomic
nervous system activity-a major component of affective processes. Specifically,
we recorded electrocardiogram and impedance cardiogram, from which we derived
heart rate, respiration rate, measures of high-frequency heart rate variability
(indices of parasympathetic autonomic nervous system activity), and ventricular
contractility (an index of sympathetic autonomic nervous system activity). Our
methods produced physiologically plausible data, and further, animals with
increased heart rates during testing were also more reactive to isolation from
their social partner and presentation of novel objects, though no relationship
was observed between reactivity and specific indices of parasympathetic or
sympathetic nervous system activity.

Inflammatory destruction of iron-rich myelin is characteristic of multiple
sclerosis (MS). Although iron is needed for oligodendrocytes to produce myelin
during development, its deposition has also been linked to neurodegeneration and 
inflammation, including in MS. We report perivascular iron deposition in multiple
sclerosis lesions that was mirrored in 72 lesions from 13 marmosets with
experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Iron accumulated mainly inside
microglia/macrophages from 6 weeks after demyelination. Consistently, expression 
of transferrin receptor, the brain's main iron-influx protein, increased as
lesions aged. Iron was uncorrelated with inflammation and postdated initial
demyelination, suggesting that iron is not directly pathogenic. Iron homeostasis 
was at least partially restored in remyelinated, but not persistently
demyelinated, lesions. Taken together, our results suggest that iron accumulation
in the weeks after inflammatory demyelination may contribute to lesion repair
rather than inflammatory demyelination per se.

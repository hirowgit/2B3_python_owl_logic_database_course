BACKGROUND: Marmosets are susceptible to dengue virus (DENV) infection. However, 
blood parameter data and clinical signs of DENV-infected marmosets are limited.
METHODS: Blood hematological and serum biochemical values were obtained from
twelve DENV-inoculated and four mock-infected marmosets. Additionally, body
temperature and activity level were determined.
RESULTS: Five DENV-inoculated marmosets demonstrated thrombocytopenia, nine
demonstrated leucopenia, and five demonstrated an increase in the levels of AST, 
ALT, LDH, and BUN. Additionally, seven DENV-inoculated marmosets demonstrated
clinical signs including fever and decreases in activity. None of the four
mock-inoculated marmosets demonstrated changes in either hematological or
biochemical parameters.
CONCLUSIONS: Marmosets inoculated with DENV exhibited clinical signs and changes 
in hematological and biochemical parameters. The results suggest that blood
parameter data and clinical signs could potentially be useful markers for
understanding the progress of DENV infection in studies using marmosets.

Common marmosets are suitable non-human primate models for many human diseases.
Standard values for blood parameters are required to evaluate physiological and
pathological situations. Two studies were conducted: study I to determine
standard values and study II to examine these under changed housing conditions.
In study I, all parameters for clinical chemistry were similar in range for both 
genders with these specifics: male marmosets had significantly higher total and
LDL cholesterol levels than females, whereas the mean corpuscular volume and the 
mean corpuscular haemoglobin were significantly lower than in females. In study
II, glucose, lymphocytes and salivary cortisol were significantly lower, and
faecal cortisol was increased during the change of housing conditions. In
conclusion, standard values for haematology and clinical chemistry for the common
marmoset were determined. Further on, parameters that are influenced by
relocation stress and its importance for experimental results are described.

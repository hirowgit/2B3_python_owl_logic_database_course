Two-photon imaging in behaving animals has revealed neuronal activities related
to behavioral and cognitive function at single-cell resolution. However,
marmosets have posed a challenge due to limited success in training on motor
tasks. Here we report the development of protocols to train head-fixed common
marmosets to perform upper-limb movement tasks and simultaneously perform
two-photon imaging. After 2-5 months of training sessions, head-fixed marmosets
can control a manipulandum to move a cursor to a target on a screen. We conduct
two-photon calcium imaging of layer 2/3 neurons in the motor cortex during this
motor task performance, and detect task-relevant activity from multiple neurons
at cellular and subcellular resolutions. In a two-target reaching task, some
neurons show direction-selective activity over the training days. In a short-term
force-field adaptation task, some neurons change their activity when the force
field is on. Two-photon calcium imaging in behaving marmosets may become a
fundamental technique for determining the spatial organization of the cortical
dynamics underlying action and cognition.

Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is an important mosquito-borne veterinary and
human pathogen that has caused large outbreaks of severe disease throughout
Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. Currently, no licensed vaccine or therapeutics 
exists to treat this potentially deadly disease. The explosive nature of RVFV
outbreaks and the severe consequences of its accidental or intentional
introduction into RVFV-free areas provide the impetus for the development of
novel vaccine candidates for use in both livestock and humans. Rationally
designed vaccine candidates using reverse genetics have been used to develop
deletion mutants of two known RVFV virulence factors, the NSs and NSm genes.
These recombinant viruses were demonstrated to be protective and immunogenic in
rats, mice, and sheep, without producing clinical illness in these animals. Here,
we expand upon those findings and evaluate the single deletion mutant (ΔNSs
rRVFV) and double deletion mutant (ΔNSs-ΔNSm rRVFV) vaccine candidates in the
common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a non-human primate (NHP) model resembling 
severe human RVF disease. We demonstrate that both the ΔNSs and ΔNSs-ΔNSm rRVFV
vaccine candidates were found to be safe and immunogenic in the current study.
The vaccinated animals received a single dose of vaccine that led to the
development of a robust antibody response. No vaccine-induced adverse reactions, 
signs of clinical illness or infectious virus were detected in the vaccinated
marmosets. All vaccinated animals that were subsequently challenged with RVFV
were protected against viremia and liver disease. In summary, our results provide
the basis for further development of the ΔNSs and ΔNSs-ΔNSm rRVFV as safe and
effective human RVFV vaccines for this significant public health threat.

BACKGROUND: Although repeated exposure to cocaine can induce hypervigilance and
conditioned-place-preference (CPP) in nonhuman primates (NHPs), more detailed
analyses are warranted since the outcome can be influenced by different factors.
METHODS: We evaluated in marmoset monkeys (Callithrix penicillata): (1) the onset
time-course and dose-dependent (3 or 7mg/kg; i.p.) profile of their
hypervigilance and CPP response to repeated cocaine exposure; (2) whether these
behavioral measures are still detectable after a 15-day no-drug period; (3) the
relationship between their hypervigilance and CPP responses; and (4) if these
behavioral changes correlate with pre- and post-drug behaviors (i.e., vigilance, 
locomotion, exploration), and/or first response to cocaine.
RESULTS: Hypervigilance had a slow-onset, was only effective with the 7mg/kg dose
of cocaine, lacked long-term conditioned effects and was not related to the
initial cocaine response or pre-drug behaviors, regardless of the dose tested.
CPP was promptly induced with the 3 and 7mg/kg doses, and had a dose-dependent
long-term effect and negative correlation with pre-drug locomotion and
exploration. Hypervigilance and CPP were not significantly correlated.
CONCLUSIONS: Although hypervigilance and CPP were induced, they had distinct
temporal and dose-dependent profiles, and were not equally co-expressed in the
same marmoset. Also, in NHPs, pre-drug locomotion and exploration were predictive
of the low-dose CPP response.

Mammalian spermatogenesis has been investigated extensively in rodents and a
strictly controlled developmental process has been defined at cellular and
molecular levels. In comparison, primate spermatogenesis has been far less well
characterized. However, important differences between primate and rodent
spermatogenesis are emerging so it is not always accurate to extrapolate findings
in rodents to primate systems. Here, we performed an extensive immunofluorescence
study of spermatogenesis in neonatal, juvenile, and adult testes in the common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) to determine primate-specific patterns of gene
expression that underpin primate germ cell development. Initially we
characterized adult spermatogonia into two main classes; mitotically active
C-KIT(+)Ki67(+) cells and mitotically quiescent SALL4(+)PLZF(+)LIN28(+)DPPA4(+)
cells. We then explored the expression of a set of markers, including
PIWIL1/MARWI, VASA, DAZL, CLGN, RanBPM, SYCP1 and HAPRIN, during germ cell
differentiation from early spermatocytes through round and elongating spermatids,
and a clear program of gene expression changes was determined as development
proceeded. We then examined the juvenile marmoset testis. Markers of gonocytes
demonstrated two populations; one that migrates to the basal membrane where they 
form the SALL4(+) or C-KIT(+) spermatogonia, and another that remains in the
lumen of the seminiferous tubule. This later population, historically identified 
as pre-spermatogonia, expressed meiotic and apoptotic markers and were eliminated
because they appear to have failed to correctly migrate. Our findings provide the
first platform of gene expression dynamics in adult and developing germ cells of 
the common marmoset. Although we have characterized a limited number of genes,
these results will facilitate primate spermatogenesis research and understanding 
of human reproduction.

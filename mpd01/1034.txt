Cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis, an Old World Monkey) have been widely
used as a non-human primate model in preclinical studies because of their genetic
and physiological similarity to humans. This trend has been followed by common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus, a New World Monkey). However, drug-metabolism
properties in these non-human primates have not been fully understood due to
limited information on cytochrome P450 (P450) enzymes, major drug-metabolizing
enzymes in humans. Multiple forms of cynomolgus monkey P450 enzymes have been
identified and characterized in comparison to those of humans, including a
cynomolgus monkey specific form, P450 2C76. Similarly, marmoset P450 1A/B, 2A,
2C, 2D, and 4F enzymes were recently identified and characterized to understand
drug metabolism properties. In this research update, updates for marmoset,
cynomolgus monkey, and human P450 cDNAs are provided. Marmoset and cynomolgus
monkey P450 enzymes showed high sequence homology to their human counterparts and
generally had similar substrate recognition functionality to human P450 enzymes; 
however, they also possibly contribute to limited specific differences in drug
oxidative metabolism partly due to small differences in amino acid residues.
These findings provide a foundation for successful use of non-human primates as
preclinical models and will help to further understand molecular mechanisms of
human P450 function. In addition to the P450 enzymes, flavin-containing
monooxygenases, another monooxygenase family, in these non-human primates have
been found to be involved in the oxidation of a variety of compounds associated
with pharmacological and/or toxicological effects in humans and are also
described.

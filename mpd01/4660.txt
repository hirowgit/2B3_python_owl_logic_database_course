Undifferentiated carcinoma of the nasal tissues in the common marmoset.

Baskerville M, Baskerville A, Manktelow BW.

The occurrence of undifferentiated carcinoma of the nasal tissues in 3 adult
marmosets is described. The tumours appeared to arise from the respiratory
epithelium of the turbinate bones and nasal septum. They were poorly
differentiated, invaded the paranasal sinuses and hard palate and metastasized to
the lungs or liver.

Nasal and intrathalamic inoculations of primates with Tacaribe virus: protection 
against Argentine hemorrhagic fever and absence of neurovirulence.

Samoilovich SR, Pecci Saavedra J, Frigerio MJ, Weissenbacher MC.

Callithrix jacchus marmosets were inoculated by different routes with two stocks 
of Tacaribe virus, one from suckling mouse brain and another from human diploid
MRC5 cells. All 12 primates inoculated by nasal route developed neutralizing
serum antibodies without any clinical signs. All 6 primates receiving the mouse
brain-Tacaribe virus were protected against lethal challenge with pathogenic XJ
strain of Junin virus, while protection was also conferred in 4 out of 6 primates
receiving the diploid cell-Tacaribe virus stock. Intramuscular (i.m.) inoculation
also elicited antibodies and conferred protection to 4 primates receiving the
diploid cell-virus stock. Intrathalamic (i.t.) inoculation of mouse brain-virus
stock caused no clinical signs or histopathologic changes in groups of 3 primates
each examined on days 33 and 90 post-infection (p.i.). All primates developed
antibody response, but no virus could be detected in their brain. Thus, Tacaribe 
virus proved harmless and immunogenic in Callithrix jacchus and protected most
marmosets against challenge with the lethal XJ strain of Junin virus.

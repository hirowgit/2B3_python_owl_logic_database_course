The administration of antigens in soluble form can induce antigen-specific immune
tolerance and suppress experimental autoimmune diseases. In a marmoset model of
multiple sclerosis induced by myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG),
marmosets tolerized to MOG were protected against acute disease, but after
tolerization treatment a lethal demyelinating disorder emerged. In these animals,
MOG-specific T cell proliferative responses were transiently suppressed, cytokine
production was shifted from a T helper type 1 (TH1) to a TH2 pattern, and titers 
of autoantibodies to MOG were enhanced. Thus, immune deviation can increase
concentrations of pathogenic autoantibodies and in some circumstances exacerbate 
autoimmune disease.

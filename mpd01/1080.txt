Genetic polymorphisms in the repeat upstream region of the serotonin transporter 
gene (SLC6A4) are associated with individual differences in stress reactivity,
vulnerability to affective disorders, and response to pharmacotherapy. However,
the molecular, neurodevelopmental and psychopharmacological mechanisms underlying
the link between SLC6A4 polymorphisms and the emotionally vulnerable phenotype
are not fully understood. Thus, using the marmoset monkey Callithrix jacchus we
characterize here a new neurobiological model to help to address these questions.
We first sequenced the marmoset SLC6A4 promoter and identified a double
nucleotide polymorphism (-2053AC/CT) and two single-nucleotide polymorphisms
(-2022C/T and -1592G/C) within the repeat upstream region. We showed their
association with gene expression using in vivo quantitative PCR and with
affective behavior using a primate test of anxiety (human intruder test). The
low-expressing haplotype (AC/C/G) was linked with high anxiety while the
high-expressing one (CT/T/C) was associated with an active coping strategy in
response to threat. Pharmacological challenge with an acute dose of the selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitor, citalopram, revealed a genotype-dependent
behavioral response. While individuals homozygous for the high anxiety-related
haplotype AC/C/G exhibited a dose-dependent, anxiogenic response, individuals
homozygous for the low anxiety-related haplotype CT/T/C showed an opposing,
dose-dependent anxiolytic effect. These findings provide a novel genetic and
behavioral primate model to study the molecular, neurodevelopmental, and
psychopharmacological mechanisms that underlie genetic variation-associated
complex behaviors, with specific implications for the understanding of normal and
abnormal serotonin actions and the development of personalized pharmacological
treatments for psychiatric disorders.

BACKGROUND: Hypothalamic kisspeptin-kisspeptin receptor signalling in primates
ensures the successful progression into puberty during development and
maintenance of reproductive capacity during adulthood. Human testis has been
shown to express high-to-moderate levels of kisspeptin and kisspeptin receptor
gene expression. In this study, we aimed at characterizing the localization of
kisspeptin and kisspeptin receptor in adult primate testis tissue.
METHODS: Immunocytochemistry was performed on paraffin-embedded testicular
sections from adult rhesus monkeys and from common marmoset monkeys.
RESULTS: Kisspeptin receptor was detected in Sertoli cells in the periphery of
the seminiferous tubules in adult testes of both species. In contrast, kisspeptin
was not localized in the seminiferous epithelium and was detected only in the
interstitial compartment of the adult rhesus monkey testis.
CONCLUSION: Kisspeptin receptor and kisspeptin are localized in the testis of Old
World and New World primates.

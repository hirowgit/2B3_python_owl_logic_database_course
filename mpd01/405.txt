Callithrix jacchus and C. penicillata marmosets are invasive to the state of Rio 
de Janeiro, Brazil, threatening the native and vulnerable C. aurita. Both
invasive species can be hosts of Trypanosoma cruzi, T. minasense, T. rangeli and 
T. devei. We aim to investigate the occurrence of trypanosomatids in Callithrix
sp. from Jardim Botânico do Rio de Janeiro, located in a central and populous
area of the city. Fifteen marmosets were captured. Blood samples were collected
for light microscopy and molecular genetics analysis. Parasites morphometric
values were evaluated for species identification. DNA was extracted from blood
samples by phenol-chloroform method, for partial amplification of the 18S rRNA
gene. PCR products were sequenced and aligned using BLAST®. A maximum likelihood 
phylogenetic tree was constructed to analyze the proximity between the observed
sequences. By light microscopy, trypomastigotes were detected in five of the
fifteen marmosets. Morphometric measurements and size polymorphism corresponded
to those previously described for T. minasense. The DNA sequences of
approximately 600 base pairs of the 18S rRNA gene were obtained for three samples
with 99% identity with T. minasense sequence, forming a cluster in the
phylogenetic tree and corroborating morphometric analysis. Trypanosoma minasense 
is a highly specific parasite to non-human primates considered as non-pathogenic.
There is no evidence of infection in humans and these parasite findings from
invasive marmosets do not support additional risks for the native species.

Oxytocin (OXT) is an important neuromodulator of social behaviors via activation 
of both oxytocin receptors (OXTR) and vasopressin (AVP) 1a receptors (AVPR1a).
Marmosets are neotropical primates with a modified OXT ligand (Pro8-OXT), and
this ligand shows significant coevolution with traits including social monogamy
and litter size. Pro8-OXT produces more potent and efficacious responses at
primate OXTR and stronger behavioral effects than the consensus mammalian OXT
ligand (Leu8-OXT). Here, we tested whether OXT/AVP ligands show differential
levels of crosstalk at primate AVPR1a. We measured binding affinities and Ca2+
signaling responses of AVP, Pro8-OXT and Leu8-OXT at human, macaque, and marmoset
AVPR1a. We found that AVP binds with higher affinity than OXT across AVPR1a, and 
marmoset AVPR1a show a 10-fold lower OXT binding affinity compared to human and
macaque AVPR1a. Both Leu8-OXT and Pro8-OXT produce a less efficacious response
than AVP at human AVPR1a and higher efficacious response than AVP at marmoset
AVPR1a. These data suggest that OXT might partially antagonize endogenous human
AVPR1a signaling and enhance marmoset AVPR1a signaling. These findings aid in
further understanding inconsistencies observed following systemic intranasal
administration of OXT and provide important insights into taxon-specific
differences in nonapeptide ligand/receptor coevolution and behavior.

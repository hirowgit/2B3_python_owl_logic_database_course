Effects of fibre on digestibility and passage time in callithricidae.

Krombach F, Flurer C, Zucker H.

The effects of fibre in a pelleted diet on food intake, digestibility of crude
fibre, dry matter and energy, on passage time and consistency of faeces were
studied in 2 species of Callithricidae, Callithrix jacchus and Saguinus
fuscicollis. Coarse cellulose, microcellulose, wheat bran and shrimp meal (chitin
= crude fibre) were tested in diets containing 2,4 and 6% total crude fibre,
respectively. Digestibility and passage time were determined by inclusion of 0.5%
Cr2O3 in the diet. Both celluloses had little influence on the digestibility of
energy and dry matter. Digestibility of crude fibre was very low. Wheat bran led 
to evident depression of energy and dry matter digestibility. High digestibility 
of crude fibre occurred at the higher levels of inclusion in the diet. Shrimp
meal was highly digested with little influence on digestibility of energy and dry
matter, indicating considerable degradation of chitin. Wheat bran showed a marked
effect, while microcellulose had no effect on passage time, consistency and
volume of faeces.

Serum biochemical, hematological and body measurement data for common marmosets
(Callithrix jacchus jacchus).

Yarbrough LW, Tollett JL, Montrey RD, Beattie RJ.

Blood samples were drawn and body measurements taken from healthy adult and
juvenile common marmosets which had been housed under controlled environmental
conditions for a minimum of 2 years. Blood was analyzed for serum biochemical and
hematological constituents.

Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disease in which pigmented midbrain
neurons progressively die producing a dopamine (DA) deficit in the striatum which
manifests as an akinetic movement disorder. Experimentally induced striatal DA
depletion in animals is a valid model of parkinsonism. The capacity of certain
substances to damage catecholaminergic neurones has been used for a long time to 
produce DA deficiency in animals. This unit focuses on methods for inducing
parkinsonism using the neurotoxins MPTP and 6-hydroxy dopamine and methods for
evaluating the animals. Other models are briefly reviewed.

This basic protocol presents Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) transformation of B cells
to create a permanent cell line to provide cells for genetic and DNA analysis.
Virus stocks are prepared from cultures of an infected marmoset cell line in the 
first support protocol. Transformed cells may be analyzed immediately or frozen
for future use as described in the second support protocol.

We review here the distribution of S-cone signals and properties of S-cone
recipient receptive fields in subcortical pathways. Nearly everything we know
about S-cone signals in the subcortical visual system comes from the study of
visual systems in cats and primates (monkeys); in this review, we concentrate on 
results from macaque and marmoset monkeys. We discuss segregation of S-cone
recipient (blue-on and blue-off) receptive fields in the dorsal lateral
geniculate nucleus and describe their receptive field properties. We treat in
some detail the question of detecting weak S-cone signals as an introduction for 
newcomers to the field. Finally, we briefly consider the question on how S-cone
signals are distributed among nongeniculate targets.

Distribution of ciliated epithelial cells in the trachea of common marmosets
(Callithrix jacchus).

Hoffmann R, Braun A, Knauf S, Kaup FJ, Bleyer M.

BACKGROUND: The distribution of ciliated cells in the tracheal epithelium of
common marmosets was evaluated.
METHODS: Light and scanning electron microscopy of tracheal epithelium was
performed.
RESULTS: Ciliated cells were concentrated in cartilage-free areas and virtually
absent in cartilage-supported epithelial regions.
CONCLUSIONS: Heterogeneous distribution of ciliated cells in the trachea has to
be considered when using animal models for translational respiratory research
approaches.

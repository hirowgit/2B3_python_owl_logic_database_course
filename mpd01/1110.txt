Primates tend to be long-lived for their size with humans being the longest lived
of all primates. There are compelling reasons to understand the underlying
age-related processes that shape human lifespan. But the very fact of our long
lifespan that makes it so compelling, also makes it especially difficult to
study. Thus, in studies of aging, researchers have turned to non-human primate
models, including chimpanzees, baboons, and rhesus macaques. More recently, the
common marmoset, Callithrix jacchus, has been recognized as a particularly
valuable model in studies of aging, given its small size, ease of housing in
captivity, and relatively short lifespan. However, little is known about the
physiological changes that occur as marmosets age. To begin to fill in this gap, 
we utilized high sensitivity metabolomics to define the longitudinal biochemical 
changes associated with age in the common marmoset. We measured 2104 metabolites 
from blood plasma at three separate time points over a 17-month period, and we
completed both a cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis of the metabolome. We 
discovered hundreds of metabolites associated with age and body weight in both
male and female animals. Our longitudinal analysis identified age-associated
metabolic pathways that were not found in our cross-sectional analysis. Pathways 
enriched for age-associated metabolites included tryptophan, nucleotide, and
xenobiotic metabolism, suggesting these biochemical pathways might play an
important role in the basic mechanisms of aging in primates. Moreover, we found
that many metabolic pathways associated with age were sex specific. Our work
illustrates the power of longitudinal approaches, even in a short time frame, to 
discover novel biochemical changes that occur with age.

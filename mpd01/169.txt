Following lesions of the primary visual cortex (V1), the lateral geniculate
nucleus (LGN) undergoes substantial cell loss due to retrograde degeneration.
However, visually responsive neurons remain in the degenerated sector of LGN, and
these have been implicated in mediation of residual visual capacities that remain
within the affected sectors of the visual field. Using immunohistochemistry, we
compared the neurochemical characteristics of LGN neurons in V1-lesioned marmoset
monkeys (Callithrix jacchus) with those of non-lesioned control animals. We found
that GABAergic neurons form approximately 6.5% of the neuronal population in the 
normal LGN, where most of these cells express the calcium-binding protein
parvalbumin. Following long-term V1 lesions in adult monkeys, we observed a
marked increase (~ sevenfold) in the proportion of GABA-expressing neurons in the
degenerated sector of the LGN, indicating that GABAergic cells are less affected 
by retrograde degeneration in comparison with magno- and parvocellular projection
neurons. In addition, following early postnatal V1 lesions and survival into
adulthood, we found widespread expression of GABA in putative projection neurons,
even outside the degenerated sectors (lesion projection zones). Our findings show
that changes in the ratio of GABAergic neurons in LGN need to be taken into
account in the interpretation of the mechanisms of visual abilities that survive 
V1 lesions in primates.

The generation and culture of transgene-free induced pluripotent stem cells
(iPSCs) from the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) present unique challenges
due to the fact that the protocols developed for culture of human or mouse
pluripotent cells are not sufficiently optimized for this particular monkey
species. Here, we describe the procedures for the reprogramming of marmoset fetal
fibroblasts to pluripotency with self-replicating mRNAs using a two-step
approach, where intermediate primary colonies generated in the first
reprogramming step are converted in the second step to iPSCs with customized
marmoset culture medium. The resulting iPSCs are free of transgenes and can be
maintained in long-term culture in feeder-free conditions.

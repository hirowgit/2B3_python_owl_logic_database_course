A new approach to the role of noradrenaline in learning: problem-solving in the
marmoset after alpha-noradrenergic receptor blockade.

Ridley RM, Haystead TA, Baker HF, Crow TJ.

Nine marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) were tested on a variety of visual
discrimination learning tasks in a Wisconsin General Test Apparatus with or
without alpha-noradrenergic receptor blockade achieved by the administration of
aceperone. After aceperone, animals were found to be severely and consistently
impaired at learning the first task of each test session and to be impaired on
new and repeated reversal learning. They were, however, unimpaired on learning
another similar task in each test session and on performance of a well-learnt
task. Results were interpreted as evidence for defective association formation
which can be compensated for by suitable priming or practice.

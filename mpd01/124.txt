We report three cases of disseminated hyperinfection by Strongyloides in primates
Callithrix jacchus and Callithrix penicillata in captivity and with progressive
weight loss syndrome. Histopathological examination revealed severe lesions in
lungs, liver, and intestines with the presence of Strongyloides larvae and in a
generalized manner, including other organs such as the pancreas and heart.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-based episomal vector system enables persistent
transgene expression, which is advantageous for efficient derivation of
transgene-free induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) without viral transduction.
Here, we report establishment of an iPSC line from somatic fibroblasts of a
neonatal common marmoset monkey (marmoset; Callithrix jacchus) using an
all-in-one episomal vector that we newly developed. The established iPSC line,
named NM-iPS, showed standard characteristics of pluripotency such as
pluripotency-related marker expression, three germ layer differentiation, and
normal karyotype (2n = 46). The novel iPSC line would be a useful resource for
stem cell research using non-human primates.

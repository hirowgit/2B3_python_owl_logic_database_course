Mutations in non-coding regulatory DNA such as enhancers underlie a wide variety 
of diseases including developmental disorders and cancer. As enhancers rapidly
evolve, understanding their function and configuration in non-human disease
models can have important clinical applications. Here, we analyze enhancer
configurations in tissues isolated from the common marmoset, a widely used
primate model for human disease. Integrating these data with human and mouse
data, we find that enhancers containing trait-associated variants are
preferentially conserved. In contrast, most human-specific enhancers are highly
variable between individuals, with a subset failing to contact promoters. These
are located further away from genes and more often reside in inactive
B-compartments. Our data show that enhancers typically emerge as instable
elements with minimal biological impact prior to their integration in a
transcriptional program. Furthermore, our data provide insight into which trait
variations in enhancers can be faithfully modeled using the common marmoset.

The aim of this study was to establish a feasible and robust magnetic resonance
imaging protocol for the quantitative assessment of cardiac function in marmosets
and to present normal values of cardiac function across different ages from young
adult, middle-aged, to very old clinically healthy animals. Cardiac MRI of 33
anesthetized marmosets at the age of 2-15 years was performed at 9.4 T using
IntraGate-FLASH that operates without any ECG-triggering and breath holding.
Normalized to post-mortem heart weight, the left ventricular end-diastolic volume
(LV-EDV) was significantly reduced in older marmosets. The LV end-systolic volume
(LV-ESV) and the LV stroke volume (LV-SV) showed a similar trend while the LV
ejection fraction (LV-EF) and wall thickening remained unchanged. Similar
observations were made for the right ventricle. Moreover, the total ventricular
myocardial volume was lower in older monkeys while no significant difference in
heart weight was found. In conclusion, IntraGate-FLASH allowed for quantification
of left ventricular cardiac function but seems to underestimate the volumes of
the right ventricle. Although less strong and without significant sex
differences, the observed age related changes were similar to previously reported
findings in humans supporting marmosets as a model system for age related
cardiovascular human diseases.

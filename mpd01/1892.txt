A first case of spontaneous opening of congenitally fused labia (CFL phenotype)
in a captive common marmoset followed by pregnancy and birth is presented here.
The occurrence of this phenotype has been previously published in captive
marmosets, but so far the etiology is unknown.

The red-green axis of colour vision evolved recently in primate evolutionary
history. Signals serving red-green colour vision travel together with signals
serving spatial vision, in the parvocellular (PC) division of the subcortical
visual pathway. However, the question of whether receptive fields of PC pathway
cells are specialized to transmit red-green colour signals remains unresolved. We
addressed this question in single-cell recordings from the lateral geniculate
nucleus of anaesthetized marmosets. Marmosets show a high proportion of
dichromatic (red-green colour-blind) individuals, allowing spatial and colour
tuning properties of PC cells to be directly compared in dichromatic and
trichromatic visual systems. We measured spatial frequency tuning for sine
gratings that provided selective stimulation of individual photoreceptor types.
We found that in trichromatic marmosets, the foveal visual field representation
is dominated by red-green colour-selective PC cells. Colour selectivity of PC
cells is reduced at greater eccentricities, but cone inputs to centre and
surround are biased to create more selectivity than predicted by a purely 'random
wiring' model. Thus, one-to-one connections in the fovea are sufficient, but not 
necessary, to create colour-selective responses. The distribution of spatial
tuning properties for achromatic stimuli shows almost complete overlap between PC
cells recorded in dichromatic and trichromatic marmosets. These data indicate
that transmission of red-green colour signals has been enabled by centre-surround
receptive fields of PC cells, and has not altered the capacity of PC cells to
serve high-acuity vision at high stimulus contrast.

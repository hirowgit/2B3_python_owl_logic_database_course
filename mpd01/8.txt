BACKGROUND: The common marmoset is widely used in current biomedical research for
various research fields. We observed macrocytic anemia in a perinatal common
marmoset with gradual weight loss and diarrhea. The objective of this case report
is to describe the diagnosis and treatment of macrocytic anemia in a perinatal
common marmoset.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 7-year-old female common marmoset showed clinical signs of
gradual weight loss and intermittent diarrhea beginning 3 months after giving
birth. Macrocytic anemia was diagnosed due to a decreased red blood cell (RBC)
count, low hemoglobin level, and increased mean corpuscular volume (MCV).
Multivitamins containing cobalamin and folate were administered for 7 days, and
the patient's RBC count recovered to near the normal range with this treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Macrocytic anemia can be diagnosed by evaluating the MCV on a
complete blood count (CBC) and cobalamin or folate levels and be treated by
supplementation with cobalamin and folate. Such supplements may be needed during 
pregnancy and lactation in female common marmosets and/or in animals with chronic
diarrhea.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is quickly gaining traction as a premier
neuroscientific model. However, considerable progress is still needed in
understanding the functional and structural organization of the marmoset brain to
rival that documented in longstanding preclinical model species, like mice, rats,
and Old World primates. To accelerate such progress, we present the Marmoset
Functional Brain Connectivity Resource (marmosetbrainconnectome.org), currently
consisting of over 70 h of resting-state fMRI (RS-fMRI) data acquired at 500 µm
isotropic resolution from 31 fully awake marmosets in a common stereotactic
space. Three-dimensional functional connectivity (FC) maps for every cortical and
subcortical gray matter voxel are stored online. Users can instantaneously view, 
manipulate, and download any whole-brain functional connectivity (FC) topology
(at the subject- or group-level) along with the raw datasets and preprocessing
code. Importantly, researchers can use this resource to test hypotheses about FC 
directly - with no additional analyses required - yielding whole-brain
correlations for any gray matter voxel on demand. We demonstrate the resource's
utility for presurgical planning and comparison with tracer-based neuronal
connectivity as proof of concept. Complementing existing structural connectivity 
resources for the marmoset brain, the Marmoset Functional Brain Connectivity
Resource affords users the distinct advantage of exploring the connectivity of
any voxel in the marmoset brain, not limited to injection sites nor constrained
by regional atlases. With the entire raw database (RS-fMRI and structural images)
and preprocessing code openly available for download and use, we expect this
resource to be broadly valuable to test novel hypotheses about the functional
organization of the marmoset brain.

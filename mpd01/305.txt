The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a New World primate that is becoming 
increasingly popular as a preclinical model. To assess functional connectivity
(FC) across the marmoset brain, resting-state functional MRI (RS-fMRI) is often
performed under isoflurane anesthesia to avoid the effects of motion,
physiological stress, and training requirements. In marmosets, however, it
remains unclear how isoflurane anesthesia affects patterns of FC. Here, we
investigated the effects of isoflurane on FC when delivered with either medical
air or 100% pure oxygen, two canonical methods of inhalant isoflurane anesthesia 
delivery. The results demonstrated that when delivered with either medical air or
100% oxygen, isoflurane globally decreased FC across resting-state networks that 
were identified in awake marmosets. Generally, although isoflurane globally
decreased FC in resting-state networks, the spatial structure of the networks was
preserved. Outside of the context of RS networks, we indexed pair-wise functional
connectivity between regions across the brain and found that isoflurane
substantially altered interhemispheric and thalamic FC. Taken together, these
findings indicate that RS-fMRI under isoflurane anesthesia is useful to evaluate 
the global structure of functional networks, but may obfuscate important nodes of
some network components when compared to data acquired in fully awake marmosets.

The neocortex has expanded during mammalian evolution. Overexpression studies in 
developing mouse and ferret neocortex have implicated the human-specific gene
ARHGAP11B in neocortical expansion, but the relevance for primate evolution has
been unclear. Here, we provide functional evidence that ARHGAP11B causes
expansion of the primate neocortex. ARHGAP11B expressed in fetal neocortex of the
common marmoset under control of the gene's own (human) promoter increased the
numbers of basal radial glia progenitors in the marmoset outer subventricular
zone, increased the numbers of upper-layer neurons, enlarged the neocortex, and
induced its folding. Thus, the human-specific ARHGAP11B drives changes in
development in the nonhuman primate marmoset that reflect the changes in
evolution that characterize human neocortical development.

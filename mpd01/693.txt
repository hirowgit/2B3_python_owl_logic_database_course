During its most recent outbreak across the Americas, Zika virus (ZIKV) was
surprisingly shown to cause fetal loss and congenital malformations in acutely
and chronically infected pregnant women. However, understanding the underlying
pathogenesis of ZIKV congenital disease has been hampered by a lack of relevant
in vivo experimental models. Here we present a candidate New World monkey model
of ZIKV infection in pregnant marmosets that faithfully recapitulates human
disease. ZIKV inoculation at the human-equivalent of early gestation caused an
asymptomatic seroconversion, induction of type I/II interferon-associated genes
and proinflammatory cytokines, and persistent viremia and viruria. Spontaneous
pregnancy loss was observed 16-18 days post-infection, with extensive active
placental viral replication and fetal neurocellular disorganization similar to
that seen in humans. These findings underscore the key role of the placenta as a 
conduit for fetal infection, and demonstrate the utility of marmosets as a highly
relevant model for studying congenital ZIKV disease and pregnancy loss.

Although feline platynosomosis has been commonly reported in several parts of the
world, the taxonomy and epidemiological chain related to cat liver flukes remain 
controversial. In this study, nuclear ribosomal ITS, 28S, and mitochondrial cox1 
sequences obtained for Platynosomum illiciens from cat, marmoset, lizard, and
snail found naturally infected in Brazil reveal no significant molecular
differences between these isolates. Moreover, sequence data confirm that
Brazilian P. illiciens from different hosts is conspecific with parasites
obtained from cats in Vietnam, supporting wide distribution of the species. The
lack of pronounced specificity of P. illiciens to definitive hosts is confirmed
here for the first time using molecular approach. The results are discussed in
context of the epizootology of platynosomosis.

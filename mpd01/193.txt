The pathological changes underlying gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction in
Parkinson's disease (PD) are poorly understood and the symptoms remain
inadequately treated. In this study we compared the functional and neurochemical 
changes in the enteric nervous system in the colon of adult, L-DOPA-responsive,
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated common marmoset, with
naïve controls. Measurement of mucosal vectorial ion transport, spontaneous
longitudinal smooth muscle activity and immunohistochemical assessment of
intrinsic innervation were each performed in discrete colonic regions of naïve
and MPTP-treated marmosets. The basal short circuit current (Isc) was lower in
MPTP-treated colonic mucosa while mucosal resistance was unchanged. There was no 
difference in basal cholinergic tone, however, there was an increased excitatory 
cholinergic response in MPTP-treated tissues when NOS was blocked with
L-Nω-nitroarginine. The amplitude and frequency of spontaneous contractions in
longitudinal smooth muscle as well as carbachol-evoked post-junctional
contractile responses were unaltered, despite a decrease in choline
acetyltransferase and an increase in the vasoactive intestinal polypeptide neuron
numbers per ganglion in the proximal colon. There was a low-level inflammation in
the proximal but not the distal colon accompanied by a change in α-synuclein
immunoreactivity. This study suggests that MPTP treatment produces long-term
alterations in colonic mucosal function associated with amplified muscarinic
mucosal activity but decreased cholinergic innervation in myenteric plexi and
increased nitrergic enteric neurotransmission. This suggests that long-term
changes in either central or peripheral dopaminergic neurotransmission may lead
to adaptive changes in colonic function resulting in alterations in ion transport
across mucosal epithelia that may result in GI dysfunction in PD.

BACKGROUND: Biomedical research has recently focused on developing new models of 
human disease by implementing genome-editing strategies in non-human primates
(NHPs) to introduce relevant gene mutations. There is a need to establish
objective semen evaluation methods to select sires for in vitro fertilization to 
perform germline editing in embryos.
METHODS: Sperm motility kinematic parameters were evaluated using a
computer-assisted semen analysis (CASA) instrument for rhesus macaques (Macaca
mulatta), cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis), and common marmosets
(Callithrix jacchus).
RESULTS: Normative sperm kinematic parameters were established, revealing
differences between marmosets and macaques. The impact of season on rhesus
macaque sperm motility was modest, where changes in sperm motility related to
season were dependent on the individual male.
CONCLUSIONS: These data provide a baseline of normative kinematic parameters for 
three captive NHP species, in which implementation of CASA may serve as a tool to
evaluate NHP semen quality.

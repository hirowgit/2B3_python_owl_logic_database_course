Nefazodone is an anti-depressant that interacts with a wealth of pharmacological 
targets, including some that may exert anti-dyskinetic and anti-psychotic effects
in Parkinson's disease (PD), notably serotonin 1A and 2A receptors. In this
study, we sought to determine the effect of nefazodone on
L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA)-induced dyskinesia and psychosis-like
behaviours (PLBs) in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine
(MPTP)-lesioned primate. Six common marmosets developed parkinsonism following
administration of MPTP, after which they were treated chronically with L-DOPA to 
induce stable dyskinesia and PLBs. In behavioural experiments, nefazodone (0.01, 
0.1 and 1 mg/kg) or vehicle was administered in combination with L-DOPA and its
effects on dyskinesia, PLBs and parkinsonian disability were assessed. The
addition of nefazodone 0.01, 0.1 and 1 mg/kg to L-DOPA reduced the severity of
peak dose dyskinesia by ≈ 21%, ≈ 39% and ≈ 42% (all P < 0.05), while it did not
have any significant effect on PLBs, when compared to L-DOPA/vehicle.
Parkinsonian disability was not affected by any dose of nefazodone. Our results
suggest that nefazodone may be effective to alleviate L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia
in PD, while it may not exert any beneficial effect on dopaminergic psychosis.

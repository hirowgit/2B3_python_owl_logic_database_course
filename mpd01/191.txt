Antagonising the serotonin 2A (5-HT2A) receptor is an efficacious way to
alleviate dyskinesia and psychosis in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, previous
research indicates that there might be a limit to the effects conferred by this
approach. 5-HT2A receptors were shown to form hetero-dimers with metabotropic
glutamate 2 (mGlu2) receptors, in which 5-HT2A blockade and mGlu2 activation
elicit equivalent effects at the downstream signalling level. We have previously 
shown that mGlu2 activation reduces both dyskinesia and psychosis-like behaviours
(PLBs) induced by L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA), in the
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-lesioned primate. Here, we
hypothesised that concurrent 5-HT2A antagonism and mGlu2 activation would provide
greater anti-dyskinetic and anti-psychotic benefits than either approach alone.
We conducted 3 series of experiments in the MPTP-lesioned marmoset. In the first 
series of experiments, the mGlu2 positive allosteric modulator LY-487,379 and the
5-HT2A antagonist EMD-281,014, either alone or in combination, were added to
l-DOPA. In the second series of experiments, the mGlu2/3 orthosteric agonist
LY-354,740 and EMD-281,014, either alone or in combination, were added to l-DOPA.
In the last series of experiments, we investigated whether mGlu2 blockade would
diminish the effects of antagonising 5-HT2A receptors. To this end, the mGlu2/3
orthosteric antagonist LY-341,495 and EMD-281,014, either alone or in
combination, were added to l-DOPA. We found that the anti-dyskinetic effect of
the combination LY-487,379/EMD-281,014 was greater than the ones conferred by
LY-487,379 (by 35%, P < 0.05) and EMD-281,014 (by 38%, P < 0.01). The
anti-dyskinetic and anti-psychotic effects of the combination
LY-354,740/EMD-281,014 were also greater than the ones conferred by LY-354,740
(by 57% for dyskinesia and 54% for PLBs, both P < 0.001) and EMD-281,014 (by 61% 
for dyskinesia and 53% for PLBs, both P < 0.001). The anti-parkinsonian action of
l-DOPA was maintained with all treatments. Lastly, the addition of LY-341,495
abolished the therapeutic effects of EMD-281,014 on dyskinesia and PLBs. Our
results suggest that mGlu2 activation may enhance the anti-dyskinetic and
anti-psychotic effects of 5-HT2A blockade and could provide relief to PD patients
with dyskinesia and psychotic symptoms beyond what can be achieved with current
therapies.

Multi-modal neuroimaging projects such as the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and 
UK Biobank are advancing our understanding of human brain architecture, function,
connectivity, and their variability across individuals using high-quality
non-invasive data from many subjects. Such efforts depend upon the accuracy of
non-invasive brain imaging measures. However, 'ground truth' validation of
connectivity using invasive tracers is not feasible in humans. Studies using
nonhuman primates (NHPs) enable comparisons between invasive and non-invasive
measures, including exploration of how "functional connectivity" from fMRI and
"tractographic connectivity" from diffusion MRI compare with long-distance
connections measured using tract tracing. Our NonHuman Primate Neuroimaging &
Neuroanatomy Project (NHP_NNP) is an international effort (6 laboratories in 5
countries) to: (i) acquire and analyze high-quality multi-modal brain imaging
data of macaque and marmoset monkeys using protocols and methods adapted from the
HCP; (ii) acquire quantitative invasive tract-tracing data for cortical and
subcortical projections to cortical areas; and (iii) map the distributions of
different brain cell types with immunocytochemical stains to better define brain 
areal boundaries. We are acquiring high-resolution structural, functional, and
diffusion MRI data together with behavioral measures from over 100 individual
macaques and marmosets in order to generate non-invasive measures of brain
architecture such as myelin and cortical thickness maps, as well as functional
and diffusion tractography-based connectomes. We are using classical and
next-generation anatomical tracers to generate quantitative connectivity maps
based on brain-wide counting of labeled cortical and subcortical neurons,
providing ground truth measures of connectivity. Advanced statistical modeling
techniques address the consistency of both kinds of data across individuals,
allowing comparison of tracer-based and non-invasive MRI-based connectivity
measures. We aim to develop improved cortical and subcortical areal atlases by
combining histological and imaging methods. Finally, we are collecting genetic
and sociality-associated behavioral data in all animals in an effort to
understand how genetic variation shapes the connectome and behavior.

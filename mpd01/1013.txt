The rodent ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra pars compacta (SNC) 
contain dopamine neurons intermixed with glutamate neurons (expressing vesicular 
glutamate transporter 2; VGluT2), which play roles in reward and aversion.
However, identifying the neuronal compositions of the VTA and SNC in higher
mammals has remained challenging. Here, we revealed VGluT2 neurons within the VTA
and SNC of nonhuman primates and humans by simultaneous detection of VGluT2 mRNA 
and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH; for identification of dopamine neurons). We found
that several VTA subdivisions share similar cellular compositions in nonhuman
primates and humans; their rostral linear nuclei have a high prevalence of VGluT2
neurons lacking TH; their paranigral and parabrachial pigmented nuclei have
mostly TH neurons, and their parabrachial pigmented nuclei have dual VGluT2-TH
neurons. Within nonhuman primates and humans SNC, the vast majority of neurons
are TH neurons but VGluT2 neurons were detected in the pars lateralis
subdivision. The demonstration that midbrain dopamine neurons are intermixed with
glutamate or glutamate-dopamine neurons from rodents to humans offers new
opportunities for translational studies towards analyzing the roles that each of 
these neurons play in human behavior and in midbrain-associated illnesses such as
addiction, depression, schizophrenia, and Parkinson's disease.

The hypolipemic effect of K12.148, a new hypolipemic compound, was examined in
normolipemic rats, marmosets and pigs. It could be demonstrated that this
compound reduced serum lipids, and in particular serum cholesterol, very
effectively in all tested animal species. The analysis of the lipids of the pig
give evidence that the hypocholesterolemic effect is due to a reduction of LDL
only. In vitro experiments with rat liver homogenates suggest that the
hypocholesterolemic effect is brought about by the inhibition of hepatic
cholesterol synthesis.

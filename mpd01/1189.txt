INTRODUCTION: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative
disorder characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons as well as the
presence of proteinaceous inclusions named Lewy bodies. α-synuclein (α-syn) is a 
major constituent of Lewy bodies, and the first disease-causing protein
characterized in PD. Several α-syn-based animal models of PD have been developed 
to investigate the pathophysiology of PD, but none of them recapitulate the full 
picture of the disease. Ageing is the most compelling and major risk factor for
developing PD but its impact on α-syn toxicity remains however unexplored. In
this study, we developed and exploited a recombinant adeno-associated viral (AAV)
vector of serotype 9 overexpressing mutated α-syn to elucidate the influence of
ageing on the dynamics of PD-related neurodegeneration associated with α-syn
pathology in different mammalian species.
RESULTS: Identical AAV pseudotype 2/9 vectors carrying the DNA for human mutant
p.A53T α-syn were injected into the substantia nigra to induce neurodegeneration 
and synucleinopathy in mice, rats and monkeys. Rats were used first to validate
the ability of this serotype to replicate α-syn pathology and second to
investigate the relationship between the kinetics of α-syn-induced nigrostriatal 
degeneration and the progressive onset of motor dysfunctions, strikingly
reminiscent of the impairments observed in PD patients. In mice, AAV2/9-hα-syn
injection into the substantia nigra was associated with accumulation of α-syn and
phosphorylated hα-syn, regardless of mouse strain. However, phenotypic mutants
with either accelerated senescence or resistance to senescence did not display
differential susceptibility to hα-syn overexpression. Of note, p-α-syn levels
correlated with nigrostriatal degeneration in mice. In monkeys, hα-syn-induced
degeneration of the nigrostriatal pathway was not affected by the age of the
animals. Unlike mice, monkeys did not exhibit correlations between levels of
phosphorylated α-syn and neurodegeneration.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, AAV2/9-mediated hα-syn induces robust nigrostriatal
neurodegeneration in mice, rats and monkeys, allowing translational comparisons
among species. Ageing, however, neither exacerbated nigrostriatal
neurodegeneration nor α-syn pathology per se. Our unprecedented multi-species
investigation thus favours the multiple-hit hypothesis for PD wherein ageing
would merely be an aggravating, additive, factor superimposed upon an independent
disease process.

Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is associated with a mortality rate of
>35%. We previously showed that MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) could infect human
macrophages and dendritic cells and induce cytokine dysregulation. Here, we
further investigated the interplay between human primary T cells and MERS-CoV in 
disease pathogenesis. Importantly, our results suggested that MERS-CoV
efficiently infected T cells from the peripheral blood and from human lymphoid
organs, including the spleen and the tonsil. We further demonstrated that
MERS-CoV infection induced apoptosis in T cells, which involved the activation of
both the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathways. Remarkably, immunostaining
of spleen sections from MERS-CoV-infected common marmosets demonstrated the
presence of viral nucleoprotein in their CD3(+) T cells. Overall, our results
suggested that the unusual capacity of MERS-CoV to infect T cells and induce
apoptosis might partly contribute to the high pathogenicity of the virus.

Ascorbic acid requirement and assessment of ascorbate status in the common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).

Flurer CI, Kern M, Rambeck WA, Zucker H.

Marmosets can tolerate an ascorbic acid (AA) deficiency for several weeks without
clinical symptoms. After being fed an AA-free diet for 3 months, nonspecific
deficiency symptoms became obvious. Different dietary levels of AA resulted in
corresponding serum ascorbate levels. The kidney threshold of AA in marmosets is 
comparable to that in humans. When the minimal AA requirement is defined as the
amount that is necessary to maintain a serum AA level above the kidney threshold,
then about 20 mg AA/kg body weight is needed. This intake was achieved in our
trial with a diet containing 500 ppm AA. Thus, the AA requirement of marmosets is
severalfold higher than the AA requirement of humans.

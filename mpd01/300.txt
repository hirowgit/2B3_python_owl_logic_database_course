The aim of this study was to establish a feasible and robust magnetic resonance
imaging protocol for the quantitative assessment of cardiac function in marmosets
and to present normal values of cardiac function across different ages from young
adult, middle-aged, to very old clinically healthy animals. Cardiac MRI of 33
anesthetized marmosets at the age of 2-15 years was performed at 9.4 T using
IntraGate-FLASH that operates without any ECG-triggering and breath holding.
Normalized to post-mortem heart weight, the left ventricular end-diastolic volume
(LV-EDV) was significantly reduced in older marmosets. The LV end-systolic volume
(LV-ESV) and the LV stroke volume (LV-SV) showed a similar trend while the LV
ejection fraction (LV-EF) and wall thickening remained unchanged. Similar
observations were made for the right ventricle. Moreover, the total ventricular
myocardial volume was lower in older monkeys while no significant difference in
heart weight was found. In conclusion, IntraGate-FLASH allowed for quantification
of left ventricular cardiac function but seems to underestimate the volumes of
the right ventricle. Although less strong and without significant sex
differences, the observed age related changes were similar to previously reported
findings in humans supporting marmosets as a model system for age related
cardiovascular human diseases.

Marmoset wasting syndrome (MWS) is clinically characterized by progressive weight
loss. Although morbidity and mortality of MWS are relatively high in captive
marmosets, its causes remain unknown. Lipid mediators are bioactive metabolites
which are produced from polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as arachidonic acid
(AA) and eicosapentaenoic acid. These lipid metabolites regulate a wide range of 
inflammatory responses and they are excreted into the urine. As urinary lipid
profiles reflect systemic inflammatory conditions, we comprehensively measured
the levels of 141 types of lipid metabolites in the urines obtained from healthy 
common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) (N = 7) or marmosets with MWS (N = 7). We
found that 41 types of metabolites were detected in all urine samples of both
groups. Among them, AA-derived metabolites accounted for 63% (26/41 types) of all
detected metabolites. Notably, the levels of AA-derived prostaglandin (PG) E2,
PGF2α, thromboxane (TX) B2 and F2-isoprostanes significantly increased in the
urine samples of marmosets with MWS. In this study, we found some urinary lipid
metabolites which may be involved in the development of MWS. Although the cause
of MWS remains unclear, our findings may provide some insight into understanding 
the mechanisms of development of MWS.

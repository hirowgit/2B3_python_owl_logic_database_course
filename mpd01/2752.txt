The invasiveness of biomedical experiments on laboratory animals should be
limited to the greatest extent possible yet without sacrificing the quality of
the data collected. To this end, refinement techniques can be used. In the
present work, we describe some of these techniques, focussing on the familiarity 
of the experimental environment, alternative sampling techniques (including the
use of positive training), telemetry, and methods for improving ethological
experiments. As a model, we have chosen the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus),
which is frequently used in biomedical research.

In this paper, we discuss issues concerning the welfare of non-human primates
used in laboratory research from an eco-ethological standpoint and suggest means 
of improving welfare. Following a brief review of the use of non-human primates
in European countries and of the legislation that governs this use, we illustrate
how a thorough eco-ethological knowledge of the species being studied can play a 
vital role in improving both its conditions and the quality of the experimental
protocols, arguing that the animal's quality of life is closely linked to the
quality of data. As a model for describing environmental enrichment techniques,
we have used the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).

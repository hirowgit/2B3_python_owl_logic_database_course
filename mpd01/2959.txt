Transpositions of primate-specific Alu elements were applied as molecular
cladistic markers in a phylogenetic analysis of South American primates.
Seventy-four human and platyrrhine loci containing intronic Alu elements were PCR
screened in various New World monkeys and the human outgroup to detect the
presence of orthologous retrotransposons informative of New World monkey
phylogeny. Six loci revealed size polymorphism in the amplification pattern,
indicating a shared derived character state due to the presence of orthologous
Alu elements confirmed by subsequent sequencing. Three markers corroborate (1)
New World monkey monophyly and one marker supports each of the following
callitrichine relationships: (2) Callithrix and Cebuella are more closely related
to each other than to any other callitrichine, (3) the callitrichines form a
monophyletic clade including Callimico, and (4) the next living relatives to the 
callitrichines are Cebus, Saimiri, and Aotus.

We investigated modulations by stimulus components placed outside of the
classical receptive field in the primary auditory cortex (A1) of awake marmosets.
Two classes of neurons were identified using single tone stimuli: neurons with
single-peaked frequency tuning characteristics (147/185, 80%) and neurons with
multipeaked frequency tuning characteristics (38/185, 20%), referred to as
single- and multipeaked units, respectively. Each class of neurons was further
studied using two-tone paradigms in which the frequency, intensity, and timing of
the second tone were systematically varied while a unit was driven by the first
tone placed at a unit's characteristic frequency (CF) if it was single-peaked or 
at one of multiple spectral peaks if it was multipeaked. The main findings were: 
1) excitatory spectral peaks in the frequency tuning of the multipeaked units
were often harmonically related. 2) Multipeaked units showed facilitation in
their responses to combinations of two harmonically related tones placed at the
spectral peaks of their frequency tuning. The two-tone facilitation was strongest
for the simultaneously presented tones. 3) In 76 of 113 single-peaked units
studied using the two-tone paradigm, facilitatory and/or inhibitory modulations
by distant off-CF tones were observed. This distant inhibition differed from
flanking (or side-band) inhibitions near CF. 4) In single-peaked units, the
distant off-CF inhibitions were dominated by tones at frequencies that were
harmonically related to the CF of a unit, whereas the facilitation by off-CF
tones was observed for a wide range of frequencies. And 5) in both single- and
multipeaked units, sound levels of two interacting tones determined whether the
two tones produced excitation or inhibition. The largest facilitation was
achieved by using two tones at their corresponding preferred sound levels.
Together, these findings suggest that extracting or rejecting harmonically
related components embedded in complex sounds may represent fundamental signal
processing properties in different classes of A1 neurons.

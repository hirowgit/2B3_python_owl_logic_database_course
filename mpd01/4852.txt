Experimental infection of Callithrix Jacchus marmosets with Herpesvirus ateles,
Herpesvirus saimiri, and Epstein Barr virus.

We inoculated common marmosets (Callithrix Jacchus) with Herpesvirus ateles
(HVA), Herpesvirus saimiri (HVS), and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). HVA-induced
tumors contained several cell types, including giant cells reminiscent of the
Sternberg-Reed cells observed in human Hodgkin's disease. HVS and EBV did not
induce tumors, although HVS was present in lymphocytes and elicited a strong
antibody response. EBV elicited only a variable antibody response. We feel that
more common marmosets should be used to determine if the pathologic and
immunologic lesions caused by HVA would be a suitable animal model for Hodgkin's 
disease and/or other malignant lymphomas of man. Inconsistency in the induction
of tumors by EBV and HVS in common marmosets suggets that this species may be a
different type of model for human cancer research than the cottontop marmoset,
which is the most susceptible animal host for EBV and HVS oncogenesis.

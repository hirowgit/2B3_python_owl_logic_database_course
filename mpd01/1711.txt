The draft genome sequences of several primates are available, providing insights 
into evolutionary and anthropological research. However, genomic resources from
New World monkeys are conspicuously lacking. To date, the genomes of only two
platyrrhine species, the common marmoset and the Bolivian squirrel monkey, have
been fully sequenced. This is especially limiting for comparative genomics
research, considering that New World monkeys are the most speciose primate group,
and platyrrhine genetic diversity is comparable to that of the catarrhines (i.e. 
apes and Old World monkeys). Here, we present the generation and annotation of
numerous sequence reads from the genomes of Spider monkey (Ateles belzebuth), Owl
monkey (Aotus lemurinus) and Uakari (Cacajao calvus), representing the three
platyrrhine families, Atelidae, Cebidae and Pitheciidae, respectively. These
sequencing reads were developed from gDNA shotgun libraries containing over 3000 
individual sequences with an average length of 726 bps. Of these sequences, 1220 
contain <20% repeats, and thus are potentially highly useful phylogenetic markers
for other platyrrhine species. Among them, a large number of sequencing reads
were found to match unique regions within the human (2462 sequences) and the
marmoset (2829 sequences) genomes. In particular, the majority of these
sequencing reads are from putatively neutrally evolving intergenic regions. Thus,
they are likely to be highly informative for inferring neutral evolutionary
patterns and genomic evolution for other New World monkeys.

The common marmoset is a new world primate belonging to the Callitrichidae family
weighing between 350 and 400 g. The marmoset has been shown to be an outstanding 
model for studying aging, reproduction, neuroscience, toxicology, and infectious 
disease. With regard to their susceptibility to infectious agents, they are
exquisite NHP models for viral, protozoan and bacterial agents, as well as
prions. The marmoset provides the advantages of a small animal model in high
containment coupled with the immunological repertoire of a nonhuman primate and
susceptibility to wild type, non-adapted viruses.

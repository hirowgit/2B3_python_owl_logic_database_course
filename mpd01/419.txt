Across vertebrates, progressive changes in vocal behavior during postnatal
development are typically attributed solely to developing neural circuits. How
the changing body influences vocal development remains unknown. Here we show that
state changes in the contact vocalizations of infant marmoset monkeys, which
transition from noisy, low frequency cries to tonal, higher pitched vocalizations
in adults, are caused partially by laryngeal development. Combining analyses of
natural vocalizations, motorized excised larynx experiments, tensile material
tests and high-speed imaging, we show that vocal state transition occurs via a
sound source switch from vocal folds to apical vocal membranes, producing louder 
vocalizations with higher efficiency. We show with an empirically based model of 
descending motor control how neural circuits could interact with changing
laryngeal dynamics, leading to adaptive vocal development. Our results emphasize 
the importance of embodied approaches to vocal development, where exploiting
biomechanical consequences of changing material properties can simplify motor
control, reducing the computational load on the developing brain.

The recent reemergence of yellow fever virus (YFV) in Brazil has raised serious
concerns due to the rapid dissemination of the virus in the southeastern region. 
To better understand YFV genetic diversity and dynamics during the recent
outbreak in southeastern Brazil, we generated 18 complete and nearly complete
genomes from the peak of the epidemic curve from nonhuman primates (NHPs) and
human infected cases across the Espírito Santo and Rio de Janeiro states. Genomic
sequencing of 18 YFV genomes revealed the estimated timing, source, and likely
routes of yellow fever virus transmission and dispersion during one of the
largest outbreaks ever registered in Brazil. We showed that during the recent
epidemic, YFV was reintroduced from Minas Gerais to the Espírito Santo and Rio de
Janeiro states multiple times between 2016 and 2019. The analysis of data from
portable sequencing could identify the corridor of spread of YFV. These findings 
reinforce the idea that continued genomic surveillance strategies can provide
information on virus genetic diversity and transmission dynamics that might
assist in understanding arbovirus epidemics.IMPORTANCE Arbovirus infections in
Brazil, including yellow fever, dengue, zika, and chikungunya, result in
considerable morbidity and mortality and are pressing public health concerns.
However, our understanding of these outbreaks is hampered by the limited
availability of genomic data. In this study, we investigated the genetic
diversity and spatial distribution of YFV during the current outbreak by
analyzing genomic data from areas in southeastern Brazil not covered by other
previous studies. To gain insights into the routes of YFV introduction and
dispersion, we tracked the virus by sequencing YFV genomes sampled from nonhuman 
primates and infected patients from the southeastern region. Our study provides
an understanding of how YFV initiates transmission in new Brazilian regions and
illustrates that genomics in the field can augment traditional approaches to
infectious disease surveillance and control.

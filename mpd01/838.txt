The common marmoset has recently gained a great deal of attention as an
experimental primate model for biological science and medical research. To use
the common marmoset for development of novel treatments and rehabilitation for
locomotor disorders, it is crucial to understand fundamental baseline
characteristics of locomotion in this species. Therefore, in the present study we
performed kinematic and kinetic analyses of quadrupedal locomotion in this
animal. A total of 14 common marmosets walking quadrupedally along a walkway were
analyzed using synchronized high-speed cameras, with two force platforms set in
the walkway. Our results demonstrated that the marmoset uses a lateral sequence
walking pattern, in contrast to the macaque and other primates, which usually
adopt a diagonal sequence pattern. Furthermore, peak vertical ground reaction
force on the forelimb was larger than that on the hindlimb. The rate of energy
recovery for quadrupedal walking in the common marmoset was much smaller than
that in the macaque, indicating that the marmoset generally utilizes bouncing
mechanics in locomotion, even though the duty factor is >0.5. This description of
locomotor characteristics of intact marmosets may serve as a basis for
comparative analyses of changes in gait due to rehabilitation and regenerative
treatments.

Head turning experiments are widely used to test the cognition of both human
infants and non-human animal species. Monitoring head turns allows researchers to
non-invasively assess attention to acoustic or visual stimuli. In the majority of
head turning experiments, the head direction analyses have been accomplished
manually, which is extremely labor intensive and can be affected by subjectivity 
or other human errors and limitations. In the current study, we introduce an
open-source computer program for measuring head directions of freely moving
animals including common marmoset monkeys (Callithrix jacchus), American
alligators (Alligator mississippiensis), and Mongolian gerbils (Meriones
unguiculatus) to reduce human effort and time in video coding. We also illustrate
an exemplary framework for an animal head turning experiment with common marmoset
monkeys. This framework incorporates computer-aided processes of data
acquisition, preprocessing, and analysis using the aforementioned software and
additional open-source software and hardware.

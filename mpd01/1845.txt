We have recently reported the discovery of the new benzhydrol template, which has
a highly potent inhibitory activity for squalene synthase, as typified by
compound 1 (SSI IC(50)=0.85 nM). However, it was composed of a pair of easy
rotatable atropisomers. In the effort to fix the isomerization, a highly potent
alkoxy-aminobenzhydrol scaffold was developed. Some of these acquired compounds
demonstrating strong cholesterol synthesis inhibitory activities in a rat hepatic
cell. Moreover, two of the series compounds exhibited specific plasma
lipid-lowering effects in in vivo animal models.

This study examines the test-retest reliability of distortion-product otoacoustic
emissions (DPOAEs) in ketamine-anesthetized common marmosets (Callithrix
jacchus). DPOAE gain functions were measured at 16 f(2)-frequencies between 3 and
24 kHz. Test-retest reliability was assessed at the following time intervals: (1)
Interleaved, in which two gain functions were obtained at each frequency before
advancing to the next frequency, (2) Immediate, wherein one gain function was
collected at all f(2)-frequencies and the retest was immediately performed
without removing the probe tip, (3) Short-term, in which the retest followed a
10-min period with the probe removed, and (4) Long-term, wherein the retest was
performed at least one week after the initial test. Reliability was assessed
using four correlation coefficients used in the literature. Test-retest
reliability was best in the interleaved interval and worst in the short-term
interval. In general, reliability was best when primary-tone levels were high.
Correlation coefficients decreased at frequencies above 12-kHz in the short-term 
and long-term intervals, but the decrease was more substantial in females than in
males in the long-term interval. At frequencies below 12 kHz, same-day
measurements (2, 3) were less repeatable, regardless of whether the probe was
removed, which may be due to time under anesthesia. These results have
implications for DPOAE studies where repeated measures are required and when
treatment or group differences are small.

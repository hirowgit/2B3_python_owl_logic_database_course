BACKGROUND: The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a small, New World
primate that is used extensively in biomedical and behavioral research. This
short-lived primate, with its small body size, ease of handling, and docile
temperament, has emerged as a valuable model for aging and neurodegenerative
research. A growing body of research has indicated exercise, aerobic exercise
especially, imparts beneficial effects to normal aging. Understanding the
mechanisms underlying these positive effects of exercise, and the degree to which
exercise has neurotherapeutic effects, is an important research focus. Thus,
developing techniques to engage marmosets in aerobic exercise would have great
advantages.
NEW METHOD: Here we describe the marmoset exercise ball (MEB) paradigm: a safe
(for both experimenter and subjects), novel and effective means to engage
marmosets in aerobic exercise. We trained young adult male marmosets to run on
treadmills for 30 min a day, 3 days a week.
RESULTS: Our training procedures allowed us to engage male marmosets in this
aerobic exercise within 4 weeks, and subjects maintained this frequency of
exercise for 3 months.
COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: To our knowledge, this is the first described
method to engage marmosets in aerobic exercise. A major advantage of this
exercise paradigm is that while it was technically forced exercise, it did not
appear to induce stress in the marmosets.
CONCLUSIONS: These techniques should be useful to researchers wishing to address 
physiological responses of exercise in a marmoset model.

There is an emerging interest in brain-mapping projects in countries across the
world, including the USA, Europe, Australia and China. In 2014, Japan started a
brain-mapping project called Brain Mapping by Integrated Neurotechnologies for
Disease Studies (Brain/MINDS). Brain/MINDS aims to map the structure and function
of neuronal circuits to ultimately understand the vast complexity of the human
brain, and takes advantage of a unique non-human primate animal model, the common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). In Brain/MINDS, the RIKEN Brain Science Institute 
acts as a central institute. The objectives of Brain/MINDS can be categorized
into the following three major subject areas: (i) structure and functional
mapping of a non-human primate brain (the marmoset brain); (ii) development of
innovative neurotechnologies for brain mapping; and (iii) human brain mapping;
and clinical research. Brain/MINDS researchers are highly motivated to identify
the neuronal circuits responsible for the phenotype of neurological and
psychiatric disorders, and to understand the development of these devastating
disorders through the integration of these three subject areas.

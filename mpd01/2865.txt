The present study describes the distribution of tyrosine hydroxylase
(TH)-immunoreactive (IR) elements in the olfactory bulb of the common marmoset
monkey (Callithrix jacchus), a primate species by immunohistochemistry. We
identified six layers of the olfactory bulb of the common marmoset monkey in
sections stained with cresyl violet. The majority of TH-IR cells were found in
the glomerular layer. A few TH-IR cells were present in the external plexiform
and granule cell layers. TH-IR fibers were identified in all layers of the
olfactory bulb. The density of these nerve fibers was high in the internal
plexiform and granule cell layers. The results in the olfactory bulb of the
common marmoset monkey are generally similar to previous reports in some mammals.
These data suggest that TH in the olfactory bulb of the common marmoset monkey
may play a role in olfactory transmission via the glomeruli like in other
mammals.

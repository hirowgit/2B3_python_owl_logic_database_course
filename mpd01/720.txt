Investigating the evolution of human speech is difficult and controversial
because human speech surpasses nonhuman primate vocal communication in scope and 
flexibility [1-3]. Monkey vocalizations have been assumed to be largely innate,
highly affective, and stereotyped for over 50 years [4, 5]. Recently, this
perception has dramatically changed. Current studies have revealed distinct
learning mechanisms during vocal development [6-8] and vocal flexibility,
allowing monkeys to cognitively control when [9, 10], where [11], and what to
vocalize [10, 12, 13]. However, specific call features (e.g., duration,
frequency) remain surprisingly robust and stable in adult monkeys, resulting in
rather stereotyped and discrete call patterns [14]. Additionally, monkeys seem to
be unable to modulate their acoustic call structure under reinforced conditions
beyond natural constraints [15, 16]. Behavioral experiments have shown that
monkeys can stop sequences of calls immediately after acoustic perturbation but
cannot interrupt ongoing vocalizations, suggesting that calls consist of single
impartible pulses [17, 18]. Using acoustic perturbation triggered by the vocal
behavior itself and quantitative measures of resulting vocal adjustments, we show
that marmoset monkeys are capable of producing calls with durations beyond the
natural boundaries of their repertoire by interrupting ongoing vocalizations
rapidly after perturbation onset. Our results indicate that marmosets are capable
of interrupting vocalizations only at periodic time points throughout calls,
further supported by the occurrence of periodically segmented phees. These ideas 
overturn decades-old concepts on primate vocal pattern generation, indicating
that vocalizations do not consist of one discrete call pattern but are built of
many sequentially uttered units, like human speech.

Bioluminescence is a natural light source based on luciferase catalysis of its
substrate luciferin. We performed directed evolution on firefly luciferase using 
a red-shifted and highly deliverable luciferin analog to establish AkaBLI, an
all-engineered bioluminescence in vivo imaging system. AkaBLI produced emissions 
in vivo that were brighter by a factor of 100 to 1000 than conventional systems, 
allowing noninvasive visualization of single cells deep inside freely moving
animals. Single tumorigenic cells trapped in the mouse lung vasculature could be 
visualized. In the mouse brain, genetic labeling with neural activity sensors
allowed tracking of small clusters of hippocampal neurons activated by novel
environments. In a marmoset, we recorded video-rate bioluminescence from neurons 
in the striatum, a deep brain area, for more than 1 year. AkaBLI is therefore a
bioengineered light source to spur unprecedented scientific, medical, and
industrial applications.

Animal models have been critical in building evidence that the prenatal
experience and intrauterine environment are capable of exerting profound and
permanent effects on metabolic health through developmental programming of
obesity. However, despite physiological and evolutionary similarities, nonhuman
primate models are relatively rare. The common marmoset monkey ( Callithrix
jacchus) is a New World monkey that has been used as a biomedical model for well 
more than 50 years and has recently been framed as an appropriate model for
exploring early-life impacts on later health and disease. The spontaneous,
multifactorial, and early-life development of obesity in the common marmoset make
it a valuable research model for advancing our knowledge about the role of the
prenatal and placental mechanisms involved in developmental programming of
obesity. This paper provides a brief overview of obesity in the common marmoset, 
followed by a discussion of marmoset reproduction and placental characteristics. 
We then discuss the occurrence and utility of variable intrauterine environments 
in developmental programming in marmosets. Evidence of developmental programming 
of obesity will be given, and finally, we put forward future directions and
innovations for including the placenta in developmental programming of obesity in
the common marmoset.

Phylogenetic classification of six novel species belonging to the genus
Bifidobacterium comprising Bifidobacterium anseris sp. nov., Bifidobacterium
criceti sp. nov., Bifidobacterium imperatoris sp. nov., Bifidobacterium italicum 
sp. nov., Bifidobacterium margollesii sp. nov. and Bifidobacterium parmae sp.
nov.

Six Bifidobacterium strains, i.e., Goo31D, Ham19E, Rab10A, Tam1G, Uis4E and
Uis1B, were isolated from domestic goose (Anser domesticus), European hamster
(Cricetus cricetus), European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), emperor tamarin
(Saguinus imperator) and pygmy marmoset (Callithrix pygmaea). Cells are
Gram-positive, non-motile, non-sporulating, facultative anaerobic and fructose
6-phosphate phosphoketolase-positive. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA,
ITS-, multilocus- sequences and the core genome revealed that bifidobacterial
strains Goo31D, Ham19E, Rab10A, Tam1G, Uis4E and Uis1B exhibit close phylogenetic
relatedness with Bifidobacterium choerinum LMG 10510, Bifidobacterium hapali DSM 
100202, Bifidobacterium saguini DSM 23967 and Bifidobacterium stellenboschense
DSM 23968. Genotyping based on the genome sequence of the isolated strains
combined with phenotypic analyses, clearly show that these strains are distinct
from each of the type strains of the so far recognized Bifidobacterium species.
Thus, Bifidobacterium anseris sp. nov. (Goo31D=LMG 30189T=CCUG 70960T),
Bifidobacterium criceti sp. nov. (Ham19E=LMG 30188T=CCUG 70962T), Bifidobacterium
imperatoris sp. nov. (Tam1G=LMG 30297T=CCUG 70961T), Bifidobacterium italicum sp.
nov. (Rab10A=LMG 30187T=CCUG 70963T), Bifidobacterium margollesii sp. nov.
(Uis1B=LMG 30296T=CCUG 70959T) and Bifidobacterium parmae sp. nov. (Uis4E=LMG
30295T=CCUG 70964T) are proposed as novel Bifidobacterium species.

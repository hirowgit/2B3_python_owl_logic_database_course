BACKGROUND: Neotropical primates are important sylvatic hosts of Trypanosoma
cruzi, the etiological agent of Chagas disease. Infection is often subclinical,
but severe disease has been described in both free-ranging and captive primates. 
Panstrongylus megistus, a major T. cruzi vector, was found infesting a
small-primate unit at Brasília zoo (ZooB), Brazil. ZooB lies close to a
gallery-forest patch where T. cruzi circulates naturally. Here, we combine
parasitological and molecular methods to investigate a focus of T. cruzi
infection involving triatomine bugs and Neotropical primates at a zoo located in 
the Brazilian Savannah.
METHODS: We assessed T. cruzi infection in vectors using optical microscopy
(n = 34) and nested PCR (n = 50). We used quantitative PCR (qPCR) to examine
blood samples from 26 primates and necropsy samples from two primates that died
during the study. We determined parasite lineages in five vectors and two
primates by comparing glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (G6pi) gene sequences.
RESULTS: Trypanosoma cruzi was found in 44 vectors and 17 primates (six genera
and eight species); one Mico chrysoleucus and one Saguinus niger had high
parasitaemias. Trypanosoma cruzi DNA was detected in three primates born to
qPCR-negative mothers at ZooB and in the two dead specimens. One Callithrix
geoffroyi became qPCR-positive over a two-year follow-up. All G6pi sequences
matched T. cruzi lineage TcI.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings strongly suggest vector-borne T. cruzi transmission
within a small-primate unit at ZooB - with vectors, and perhaps also parasites,
presumably coming from nearby gallery forest. Periodic checks for vectors and
parasites would help eliminate T. cruzi transmission foci in captive-animal
facilities. This should be of special importance for captive-breeding programs
involving endangered mammals, and would reduce the risk of accidental T. cruzi
transmission to keepers and veterinarians.

Primates tend to be long-lived for their size with humans being the longest lived
of all primates. There are compelling reasons to understand the underlying
age-related processes that shape human lifespan. But the very fact of our long
lifespan that makes it so compelling, also makes it especially difficult to
study. Thus, in studies of aging, researchers have turned to non-human primate
models, including chimpanzees, baboons, and rhesus macaques. More recently, the
common marmoset, Callithrix jacchus, has been recognized as a particularly
valuable model in studies of aging, given its small size, ease of housing in
captivity, and relatively short lifespan. However, little is known about the
physiological changes that occur as marmosets age. To begin to fill in this gap, 
we utilized high sensitivity metabolomics to define the longitudinal biochemical 
changes associated with age in the common marmoset. We measured 2104 metabolites 
from blood plasma at three separate time points over a 17-month period, and we
completed both a cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis of the metabolome. We 
discovered hundreds of metabolites associated with age and body weight in both
male and female animals. Our longitudinal analysis identified age-associated
metabolic pathways that were not found in our cross-sectional analysis. Pathways 
enriched for age-associated metabolites included tryptophan, nucleotide, and
xenobiotic metabolism, suggesting these biochemical pathways might play an
important role in the basic mechanisms of aging in primates. Moreover, we found
that many metabolic pathways associated with age were sex specific. Our work
illustrates the power of longitudinal approaches, even in a short time frame, to 
discover novel biochemical changes that occur with age.

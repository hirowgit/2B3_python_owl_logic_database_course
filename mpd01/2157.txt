BACKGROUND: Animal models of human brain disorders often have to rely on
non-human primates because of their immunological, physiological, and cognitive
similarities to humans.
METHODS: Localized proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy was performed to assess
cerebral metabolite profiles of male common marmoset monkeys in vivo and to
determine putative alterations of adult brain metabolism in response to
intrauterine hyperexposure to the synthetic glucocorticoid hormone dexamethasone.
RESULTS: Excellent spectral quality allowed for absolute quantification of the
concentrations of major metabolites in predominantly white matter, gray matter,
and thalamus. Marmoset monkeys intrauterinely hyperexposed to dexamethasone
revealed normal neurochemical profiles at adulthood.
CONCLUSIONS: Prenatally applied dexamethasone does not lead to persistent
metabolic alterations affecting adult brain integrity.

The response of the classical receptive field of visual neurons can be suppressed
by stimuli that, when presented alone, cause no change in the discharge rate.
This suppression reveals the presence of an extraclassical receptive field
(ECRF). In recordings from the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of a New World
primate, the marmoset, we characterize the mechanisms that contribute to the ECRF
by measuring their spatiotemporal tuning during prolonged exposure to a
high-contrast grating (contrast adaptation). The ECRF was strongest in
magnocellular cells, where contrast adaptation reduced suppression from the ECRF:
adaptation of the ECRF transferred across spatial frequency, temporal frequency, 
and orientation, but not across space. This implies that the ECRF of LGN cells
comprises multiple adaptable mechanisms, each broadly tuned but spatially
localized, and consistent with a retinal origin. Signals from the ECRF saturated 
at high contrasts, and so adaptation of one part of the ECRF brought into its
operating range signals from other parts of the visual field. Although the ECRF
is adaptable, its major impact during contrast adaptation to a spatially extended
pattern was to reduce visual response and hence reduce a neuron's susceptibility 
to contrast adaptation; in normal viewing, a major role of the ECRF might be to
protect visual sensitivity in scenes dominated by high contrast.

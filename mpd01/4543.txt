Effects of arecoline and pilocarpine on learning ability in marmosets pretreated 
with hemicholinium-3.

Ridley RM, Baker HF, Drewett B.

Common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) were trained to perform serial reversal
position discrimination tasks in a Wisconsin General Test Apparatus.
Intraventricular injection of hemicholinium-3 4 h before testing resulted in a
profound impairment of position discrimination learning which could be overcome
by the intramuscular administration of low doses of the muscarinic agonists,
arecoline or pilocarpine.

Local myotoxicity of ketamine hydrochloride in the marmoset.

Davy CW, Trennery PN, Edmunds JG, Altman JF, Eichler DA.

An investigation of raised plasma aspartate aminotransferase (AST) in marmosets
after intramuscular ketamine injection suggested a local myotoxicity. This was
confirmed by a range of histopathological findings from myofibrillar striation
loss to necrosis. In addition to the elevations in AST levels, creatine kinase
and the lactate dehydrogenase-5 isoenzyme levels were elevated. It was further
demonstrated that, although the physical properties of the injectable solution
(pH, osmolality) and to a lesser extent the injection procedure itself caused
slight changes in plasma enzyme levels, the ketamine was predominantly
responsible for the lesion. No hepatic interactions were seen. This effect should
be taken into consideration when this anaesthetic is used in the marmoset if the 
primary objectives of the experiment entail routine blood analyses.

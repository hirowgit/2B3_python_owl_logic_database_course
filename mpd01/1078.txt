Methylmercury (MeHg) is known to selectively damage the calcarine and precentral 
cortices along deep sulci and fissures in adult cases, but the detailed mechanism
is still unclear. This study aims to identify and analyze the differential
proteome expression in two regions of the cerebrum (the frontal lobe and the
occipital lobe including the calcarine sulcus) of the common marmoset exposed to 
MeHg using a shot-gun proteomic approach. A total of 1045 and 1062 proteins were 
identified in the frontal lobe (FL) and occipital lobe (OL), of which, 62 and 89 
proteins were found significantly changed with MeHg exposure. Functional
enrichment/depletion analysis showed that the lipid metabolic process and
proteolysis were affected in both two lobes. Functional changes in FL were
characterized in cell cycle and cell division, sulfur compound metabolic process,
microtubule-based process and glycerolipid metabolic process. In comparison,
proteins were enriched in the functions of transport, carbohydrate metabolic
process, chemical caused homeostasis and regulation of body fluid levels in OL.
Pathway analysis predicted that vasopressin-regulated water reabsorption was
disturbed in MeHg-treated FL. Our results showed that MeHg induced regional
specific protein changes in FL and OL but with similar endpoint effects such as
energy diminish and disruption of water transport. APOE and GPX1 were shown to be
possible key proteins targeted by MeHg leading to multiple functional changes in 
OL. This is the first report of the whole proteome changes of primate cerebrum
for MeHg neurotoxicity, and the results will contribute to the understanding of
molecular basis of MeHg intoxication in humans.

INTRODUCTION: Insight into susceptibility mechanisms underlying Parkinson's
disease (PD) would aid the understanding of disease etiology, enable target
finding and benefit the development of more refined disease-modifying strategies.
METHODS: We used intermittent low-dose MPTP (0.5 mg/kg/week) injections in
marmosets and measured multiple behavioral and neurochemical parameters.
Genetically diverse monkeys from different breeding families were selected to
investigate inter- and intrafamily differences in susceptibility to MPTP
treatment.
RESULTS: We show that such differences exist in clinical signs, in particular
nonmotor PD-related behaviors, and that they are accompanied by differences in
neurotransmitter levels. In line with the contribution of a genetic component,
different susceptibility phenotypes could be traced back through genealogy to
individuals of the different families.
CONCLUSION: Our findings show that low-dose MPTP treatment in marmosets
represents a clinically relevant PD model, with a window of opportunity to
examine the onset of the disease, allowing the detection of individual
variability in disease susceptibility, which may be of relevance for the
diagnosis and treatment of PD in humans.

Understanding masseter muscle (MM) innervation is critical for the study of
cell-specific mechanisms of pain induced by temporomandibular disorder (TMDs) or 
after facial surgery. Here, we identified trigeminal (TG) sensory neuronal
subtypes (MM TG neurons) innervating MM fibers, masseteric fascia, tendons, and
adjusted tissues. A combination of patch clamp electrophysiology and
immunohistochemistry (IHC) on TG neurons back-traced from reporter mouse MM found
nine distinct subtypes of MM TG neurons. Of these neurons, 24% belonged to
non-peptidergic IB-4+/TRPA1- or IB-4+/TRPA1+ groups, while two TRPV1+ small-sized
neuronal groups were classified as peptidergic/CGRP+ One small-sized CGRP+
neuronal group had a unique electrophysiological profile and were recorded from
Nav1.8- or trkC+ neurons. The remaining CGRP+ neurons were medium-sized, could be
divided into Nav1.8-/trkC- and Nav1.8low/trkC+ clusters, and showed large
5HT-induced current. The final two MM TG neuronal groups were trkC+ and had no
Nav1.8 and CGRP. Among MM TG neurons, TRPV1+/CGRP- (somatostatin+), tyrosine
hydroxylase (TH)+ (C-LTMR), TRPM8+, MrgprA3+, or trkB+ (Aδ-LTMR) subtypes have
not been detected. Masseteric muscle fibers, tendons and masseteric fascia in
mice and the common marmoset, a new world monkey, were exclusively innervated by 
either CGRP+/NFH+ or CGRP-/NFH+ medium-to-large neurons, which we found using a
Nav1.8-YFP reporter, and labeling with CGRP, TRPV1, neurofilament heavy chain
(NFH) and pgp9.5 antibodies. These nerves were mainly distributed in tendon and
at junctions of deep-middle-superficial parts of MM. Overall, the data presented 
here demonstrates that MM is innervated by a distinct subset of TG neurons, which
have unique characteristics and innervation patterns.

Adeno-associated virus 6 (AAV6) has been proposed as a potential vector candidate
for specific gene expression in pain-related dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, 
but this has not been confirmed in nonhuman primates. The aim of our study was to
analyze the transduction efficiency and target specificity of this viral vector
in the common marmoset by comparing it with those in the rat. When green
fluorescent protein-expressing serotype-6 vector was injected into the sciatic
nerve, the efficiency of gene expression in DRG neurons was comparable in both
species. We found that the serotype-6 vector was largely specific to the
pain-related ganglion neurons in the marmoset, as well as in the rat, whereas the
serotype-9 vector resulted in contrasting effects in the two species. Neither
AAV6 nor AAV9 resulted in DRG toxicity when administered via the sciatic nerve,
suggesting this as a safer route of sensory nerve transduction than the currently
used intrathecal or intravenous administrative routes. Furthermore, the AAV6
vector could be an optimal serotype for gene therapy for human chronic pain that 
has a minimal effect on other somatosensory functions of DRG neurons.

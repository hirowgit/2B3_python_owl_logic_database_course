Contraception is an important population control method for the colony management
of primates housed in captivity. Etonogestrel (ENG) implants (i.e., Implanon®)
are a widely used progestin-based contraceptive in common marmosets (Callithrix
jacchus) with the theoretical advantages of being reversible and long-acting.
However, no dose and efficacy data are available yet. Therefore, data from 52
adult female marmosets contracepted with ENG (one-fourth or one-third of an
implant) housed at the Biomedical Primate Research Centre (BPRC, Rijswijk, The
Netherlands) over the past 18 years were analyzed. Using an electronic database, 
a retrospective longitudinal cohort study was conducted to calculate the
reproductive data before, during and after ENG use. The data show an
effectiveness in preventing pregnancy of 99%. The implant was effective within
one week after insertion. Unintended pregnancies did occur, but in 60% of these
cases, the animals were already pregnant at the time of implant insertion. In
these cases, healthy offspring were born despite the use of the implant. No
stillbirths, neonatal deaths or maternal deaths could be linked to ENG use. After
implant removal, 83% of the animals delivered healthy offspring. No difference in
contraception efficacy was observed between the use of one-fourth or one-third of
an implant. ENG achieved a contraceptive protection exceeding 99% and was shown
to be reversible concerning fertility. To our knowledge, this is the first
detailed analysis on the use of ENG in marmosets.

Alginate as a versatile naturally occurring biomaterial has found widespread use 
in the biomedical field due to its unique features such as biocompatibility and
biodegradability. The ability of its semipermeable hydrogels to provide a
favourable microenvironment for clinically relevant cells made alginate
encapsulation a leading technology for immunoisolation, 3D culture,
cryopreservation as well as cell and drug delivery. The aim of this work is the
evaluation of structural properties and swelling behaviour of the core-shell
capsules for the encapsulation of multipotent stromal cells (MSCs), their 3D
culture and cryopreservation using slow freezing. The cells were encapsulated in 
core-shell capsules using coaxial electrospraying, cultured for 35 days and
cryopreserved. Cell viability, metabolic activity and cell-cell interactions were
analysed. Cryopreservation of MSCs-laden core-shell capsules was performed
according to parameters pre-selected on cell-free capsules. The results suggest
that core-shell capsules produced from the low viscosity high-G alginate are
superior to high-M ones in terms of stability during in vitro culture, as well as
to solid beads in terms of promoting formation of viable self-assembled cellular 
structures and maintenance of MSCs functionality on a long-term basis. The
application of 0.3 M sucrose demonstrated a beneficial effect on the integrity of
capsules and viability of formed 3D cell assemblies, as compared to 10% dimethyl 
sulfoxide (DMSO) alone. The proposed workflow from the preparation of core-shell 
capsules with self-assembled cellular structures to the cryopreservation appears 
to be a promising strategy for their off-the-shelf availability.

Limited access to primary tissue from various nonhuman primate (NHP) species
represents a significant unmet need that hampers progress in understanding unique
cellular diversity and gene regulation of specific tissues and organs in stem
cell translational research. Most comparative biology studies have been limited
to using postmortem tissue usually frozen specimens with limited utility for
research. The generation of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines from
somatic cells, such as adult skin or blood cells, offers an alternative to
invasive and ethically controversial interventions for acquiring tissue.
Pluripotent iPSCs have virtually an unlimited capacity to proliferate and
differentiate into all cell types of the body. We are generating high-quality
validated NHP iPSC lines to offer to scientific community and facilitate their
research programs. We use the non-integrative episomal vector system to generate 
iPSCs from NHP skin biopsies. In this chapter we describe the validation of NHP
iPSC lines by confirming pluripotency and their propensity to differentiate into 
all three germ layers ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm according to established
standards and measurable limits for a set of marker genes incorporated into a
scorecard.

Chitin is a polymer of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc) and a main constituent of 
insects' exoskeleton. Insects are rich in protein with high energy conversion
efficiency. Recently, we have reported that acidic chitinases (Chia) act as
digestive enzymes in mouse, pig and chicken (omnivorous) but not in dog
(carnivorous) and bovine (herbivorous), indicating that feeding behavior affects 
Chia expression levels, and determines chitin digestibility in the particular
animals. Common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) belongs to New World monkey family 
and provides a potential bridge between mouse models and human diseases. Common
marmoset is an insectivorous nonhuman primate with unknown expression levels and 
enzymatic functions of the Chia homologue, CHIA. Here, we report that common
marmoset highly expresses pepsin-, trypsin- and chymotrypsin-resistant CHIA in
the stomach. We show that CHIA is most active at pH 2.0 and degrades chitin and
mealworm shells into GlcNAc dimers under gastrointestinal conditions. Although
common marmoset and crab-eating monkey (Old World monkey) have two CHIA genes in 
their genomes, they primarily express one gene in the stomach. Thus, this study
is the first to investigate expression levels and enzymatic functions of CHIA in 
a New World primate, contributing to the understanding of dietary adaptation and 
digestion in this taxon.

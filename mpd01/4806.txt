The maturation and aging of the vertebrae of marmosets.

Bernick S, Cailliet R, Levy B.

This study deals with the growth, maturation, and age changes to the
cartilaginous end-plates of vertebrae from marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) varying
in age from birth to 10 years. The cartilaginous end-plate is divided into an
inner growth layer and an outer articular zone that abuts against the
intervertebral disc. The growth cartilage gradually narrows and disappears by 1
year of age, when the animal reaches physical maturity. The articular cartilage
undergoes changes in collagen and ground substance that leads to its
calcification. There was a progressive resorption of the calcified articular
cartilage beginning at 3 years of age and continuing throughout the aging period.
In the vertebrae of 8- and 10-year-old animals, only a thin layer of calcified
cartilage separates the disc from the underlying bone.

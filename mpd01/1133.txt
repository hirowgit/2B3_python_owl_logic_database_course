The first draft of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) genome was published 
by the Marmoset Genome Sequencing and Analysis Consortium. The draft was based on
whole-genome shotgun sequencing, and the current assembly version is
Callithrix_jacches-3.2.1, but there still exist 187,214 undetermined gap regions 
and supercontigs and relatively short contigs that are unmapped to chromosomes in
the draft genome. We performed resequencing and assembly of the genome of common 
marmoset by deep sequencing with high-throughput sequencing technology. Several
different sequence runs using Illumina sequencing platforms were executed, and
181 Gbp of high-quality bases including mate-pairs with long insert lengths of 3,
8, 20, and 40 Kbp were obtained, that is, approximately 60× coverage. The
resequencing significantly improved the MGSAC draft genome sequence. The N50 of
the contigs, which is a statistical measure used to evaluate assembly quality,
doubled. As a result, 51% of the contigs (total length: 299 Mbp) that were
unmapped to chromosomes in the MGSAC draft were merged with chromosomal contigs, 
and the improved genome sequence helped to detect 5,288 new genes that are
homologous to human cDNAs and the gaps in 5,187 transcripts of the Ensembl gene
annotations were completely filled.

High-resolution metabolomics has created opportunity to integrate nutrition and
metabolism into genetic studies to improve understanding of the diverse radiation
of primate species. At present, however, there is very little information to help
guide experimental design for study of wild populations. In a previous
non-targeted metabolomics study of common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus), Rhesus 
macaques, humans, and four non-primate mammalian species, we found that essential
amino acids (AA) and other central metabolites had interspecies variation similar
to intraspecies variation while non-essential AA, environmental chemicals and
catabolic waste products had greater interspecies variation. The present study
was designed to test whether 55 plasma metabolites, including both nutritionally 
essential and non-essential metabolites and catabolic products, differ in
concentration in common marmosets and humans. Significant differences were
present for more than half of the metabolites analyzed and included AA, vitamins 
and central lipid metabolites, as well as for catabolic products of AA,
nucleotides, energy metabolism and heme. Three environmental chemicals were
present at low nanomolar concentrations but did not differ between species. Sex
and age differences in marmosets were present for AA and nucleotide metabolism
and warrant additional study. Overall, the results suggest that quantitative,
targeted metabolomics can provide a useful complement to non-targeted
metabolomics for studies of diet and environment interactions in primate
evolution.

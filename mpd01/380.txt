BACKGROUND: For the diagnosis and treatment of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma
(ATLL) caused by human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) are required
therapeutic modalities urgently. Non-human primate models for ATLL would provide 
a valuable information for clinical studies. We did a pilot study to establish an
ATLL non-human primate model using common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus).
METHODS: We inoculated HTLV-1-producing MT-2 cells into 9-month-old marmosets,
either intraperitoneally or intravenously. We next administrated MT-2 cells into 
13-month-old marmosets under cyclosporine A (CsA) treatment to promote infection.
HTLV-1 infection was determined by measuring HTLV-1 antibody titer in the common 
marmosets.
RESULTS: The HTLV-1 antibody titer increased in the intraperitoneally inoculated 
marmoset with or without CsA treatment, and it kept over five 5 years though
proviral copy number (proviral load, PVL) remained low throughout the study.
CONCLUSION: We obtained HTLV-1 asymptomatic carriers of common marmosets by
inoculating MT-2 cells.

BACKGROUND: Non-human primates (NHPs) are susceptible to dogs' attacks, events
that may cause muscle damage along with stress, and could be in some extent
compatible with capture myopathy, a syndrome that results in myoglobinuria and
renal damage.
METHODS: We aimed to evaluate by histopathology pre-existing lesions and
subsequent sequelae related to dogs' attacks, acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and
myoglobinuria, as well as the usefulness of Pearls Stain and IHC to diagnose it. 
Histopathology was performed in available organs, and sections of kidney
submitted to Prussian blue stain and myoglobin immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: During January 2014-June 2016, 16/145 (11%) of NHPs received by Adolfo
Lutz Institute, Brazil were reported as attacked by dogs. A high frequency of
young and debilitated animals was found. Myoglobinuria was observed in more than 
half animals (9/16; 56.2%), from which (5/9; 55.5%) presented ATN.
CONCLUSIONS: Kidney lesions are plausible findings in NHPs attacked by dogs.

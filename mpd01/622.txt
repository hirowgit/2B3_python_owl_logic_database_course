Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in common marmosets is a
translationally relevant model of the chronic neurologic disease multiple
sclerosis. Following the introduction of a new dietary supplement in our
purpose-bred marmoset colony, the percentage of marmosets in which clinically
evident EAE could be induced by sensitization against recombinant human myelin
oligodendrocyte glycoprotein in IFA decreased from 100 to 65%. The reduced EAE
susceptibility after the dietary change coincided with reduced Callitrichine
herpesvirus 3 expression in the colony, an EBV-related γ1-herpesvirus associated 
with EAE. We then investigated, in a controlled study in marmoset twins, which
disease-relevant parameters were affected by the dietary change. The selected
twins had been raised on the new diet for at least 12 mo prior to the study. In
twin siblings reverted to the original diet 8 wk prior to EAE induction, 100%
disease prevalence (eight out of eight) was restored, whereas in siblings
remaining on the new diet the EAE prevalence was 75% (six out of eight). Spinal
cord demyelination, a classical hallmark of the disease, was significantly lower 
in new-diet monkeys than in monkeys reverted to the original diet. In new-diet
monkeys, the proinflammatory T cell response to recombinant human myelin
oligodendrocyte glycoprotein was significantly reduced, and RNA-sequencing
revealed reduced apoptosis and enhanced myelination in the brain. Systematic
typing of the marmoset gut microbiota using 16S rRNA sequencing demonstrated a
unique, Bifidobacteria-dominated composition, which changed after disease
induction. In conclusion, targeted dietary intervention exerts positive effects
on EAE-related parameters in multiple compartments of the marmoset's
gut-immune-CNS axis.

Epstein-Barr virus-encoded RNAs (EBER1 and EBER2) are two highly abundant,
non-protein coding RNAs consistently expressed in all EBV infected cells, but
their function remains poorly understood. Conventional in situ hybridization
studies have indicated that these RNAs are present exclusively in the nucleus. We
have recently demonstrated that EBERs can be excreted from infected cells via
exosomes. However, the details of the steps involved in their excretion remain
unknown. In this study, we aimed to directly track the journey of EBERs from the 
nucleus to the excretory exosomes of EBV immortalized B-lymphocytes. Using a
combination of molecular and novel immuno-gold labelled electron microscopy (EM) 
based techniques, we demonstrate the presence of EBERs, not only in the nucleus, 
but also in the cytoplasm of EBV infected B cell lines. EBERs were also seen in
exosomes shed from infected cells along with the EBER binding protein La. Our
results show, for the first time, that at least a proportion of EBERs are
transported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm where they appear to be loaded into
multi-vesicular bodies for eventual excretion via exosomes.

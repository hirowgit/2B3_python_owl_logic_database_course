Common marmosets have been used extensively in biomedical research and the recent
advent of techniques to generate transgenic marmosets has accelerated the use of 
this model. New methods that efficiently assess the degree of cognitive function 
in common marmosets are needed in order to establish their suitability as
non-human primate models of higher brain function disorders. Here, we have
developed a new apparatus suitable for testing the cognitive functions of common 
marmosets. Utilizing a mini laptop PC with a touch-sensitive screen as the main
component, the apparatus is small and lightweight and can be easily attached to
the home cages. The ease of designing and testing new paradigms with the flexible
software is another advantage of this system. We have tested visual
discrimination and its reversal tasks using this apparatus and confirmed its
efficacy.

We examined multiunit responses to tones and to 1/3 and 2/3 octave band-pass
noise (BPN) in the marmoset primary auditory cortex (A1) and the caudomedial belt
(CM). In both areas, BPN was more effective than tones, evoking multiunit
responses at lower intensity and across a wider frequency range. Typically, the
best responses to BPN remained at the characteristic frequency. Additionally, in 
both areas responses to BPN tended to be of greater magnitude and shorter latency
than responses to tones. These effects are consistent with the integration of
more excitatory inputs driven by BPN than by tones. While it is generally thought
that single units in A1 prefer narrow band sounds such as tones, we found that
best responses for multi units in both A1 and CM were obtained with noises of
narrow spectral bandwidths.

BACKGROUND: Pseudotyping of a lentiviral vector with fusion glycoproteins
composed of rabies virus glycoprotein (RVG) and vesicular stomatitis virus
glycoprotein (VSVG) segments achieves high gene transfer efficiency through
retrograde transport in the nervous system. In our previous study, we determined 
the junction of RVG/VSVG segments of glycoproteins that enhances the transduction
efficiency of the neuron-specific retrograde gene transfer (NeuRet) vector
(termed fusion glycoprotein type E or FuG-E).
NEW METHOD: We aimed to optimize the amino acid residue at position 440 in the
membrane-proximal region of FuG-E to improve the efficiency of retrograde gene
transfer in the brain.
RESULTS: We constructed variants of FuG-E with 18 kinds of single amino acid
substitutions at residue 440 to generate lentiviral vectors pseudotyped with
these variants, and tested in vivo gene transfer of the vectors in the mouse
brain. The FuG-E (P440E) variant, in which proline was substituted by glutamate
at residue 440 in FuG-E, showed the greatest retrograde gene transfer efficiency 
in the brain, bearing the property of the NeuRet vector. The FuG-E (P440E)
pseudotype also displayed efficient retrograde gene transfer in the common
marmoset brain.
COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: The NeuRet vector with the FuG-E (P440E)
variant demonstrated higher retrograde gene transfer efficiency into different
neural pathways compared with the parental FuG-E vector.
CONCLUSIONS: The FuG-E (P440E) pseudotype provides a powerful tool to investigate
neural circuit mechanisms underlying various brain functions and for gene therapy
trials of neurological and neurodegenerative diseases.

BACKGROUND: The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is one of the most studied
Neotropical primates regarding reproduction. However, little has been reported on
the black-tufted-ear marmoset (Callithrix penicillata), which may produce fertile
hybrids with other Callithrix. This is the first study to evaluate sperm freezing
from black-tufted-ear marmoset.
METHODS: Testicles from all animals were measured, and semen was collected by
penile vibrostimulation. Samples were analyzed after collection, after chilling
and addition of glycerol, and after thawing.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Fresh semen from both species was similar in many
aspects. Additionally, there is a relationship between total motility, plasma
membrane integrity, and acrosome integrity observed in sperm samples from both
species. We managed to evaluate fresh and thawed sperm with suitable methods for 
use under zoo or field conditions. However, TEST egg yolk with glycerol at 4% and
6% concentration was not effective for sperm protection in both species during
cryopreservation.

Centromere protein B (CENP-B) is one of the major proteins involved in centromere
formation, binding to centromeric repetitive DNA by recognizing a 17 bp motif
called the CENP-B box. Hominids (humans and great apes) carry large numbers of
CENP-B boxes in alpha satellite DNA (AS, the major centromeric repetitive DNA of 
simian primates). Only negative results have been reported regarding the presence
of the CENP-B box in other primate taxa. Consequently, it is widely believed that
the CENP-B box is confined, within primates, to the hominids. We report here that
the common marmoset, a New World monkey, contains an abundance of CENP-B boxes in
its AS. First, in a long contig sequence we constructed and analysed, we
identified the motif in 17 of the 38 alpha satellite repeat units. We then
sequenced terminal regions of additional clones and found the motif in many of
them. Immunostaining of marmoset cells demonstrated that CENP-B binds to DNA in
the centromeric regions of chromosomes. Therefore, functional CENP-B boxes are
not confined to hominids. Our results indicate that the efficiency of
identification of the CENP-B box may depend largely on the sequencing methods
used, and that the CENP-B box in centromeric repetitive DNA may be more common
than researchers previously thought.

Common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) are an important NHP model for the study of
human aging and age-related diseases. However, the full potential of marmosets as
a research model has not been realized due to a lack of evidence-based,
standardized procedures for their captive management, especially regarding diet
and feeding husbandry. In the present study, we conducted a high-resolution
metabolomics analysis of plasma from marmosets from a 3-mo dietary crossover
study to determine whether significant metabolic differences occur with a
semisynthetic chemically defined (purified) diet as needed for controlled
nutrition research. Marmosets were fed a standard, diverse-ingredient diet,
followed by a semisynthetic purified diet, and then were switched back to the
standard diet. The standard diet used in this analysis was specific to the animal
facility, but it is similar in content to the diets currently used for other
marmoset colonies. High-resolution metabolomics of plasma with liquid
chromatography-mass spectrometry and bioinformatics was used to measure metabolic
differences. The concentration of the essential amino acids methionine,
leucine/isoleucine, lysine, and threonine were higher when marmosets were fed the
purified diet. In contrast, phenylalanine concentrations were higher during
exposure to the standard diet. In addition, metabolic pathway enrichment and
analysis revealed differences among metabolites associated with dopamine
metabolism and the carnitine shuttle. These results show that diet-associated
differences in metabolism occur in marmosets and suggest that additional
nutritional studies with detailed physiologic characterization are needed to
optimize standard and purified diets for common marmosets.

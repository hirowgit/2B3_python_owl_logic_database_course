The efficiency of most of the new antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) on clinical trials
still falls short the success reported in pre-clinical studies, possibly because 
the validity of the animal models is insufficient to fully represent the human
pathology. To improve the translational value for testing AEDs, we propose the
use of non-human primates. Here, we suggest that triggering limbic seizures with 
low doses of PTZ in pilocarpine-treated marmosets might provide a more effective 
basis for the development of AED. Marmosets with epileptic background were more
susceptible to seizures induced by PTZ, which were at least 3 times longer and
more severe (about 6 times greater frequency of generalized seizures) in
comparison to naïve peers. Accordingly, PTZ-induced seizures were remarkably less
attenuated by AEDs in epileptic than naïve marmosets. While phenobarbital
(40mg/kg) virtually abolished seizures regardless of the animal's background,
carbamazepine (120mg/kg) and valproic acid (400mg/kg) could not prevent
PTZ-induced seizures in epileptic animals with the same efficiency as observed in
naïve peers. VPA was less effective regarding the duration of individual seizures
in epileptic animals, as assessed in ECoG (p=0.05). Similarly following CBZ
treatment, the behavioral manifestation of generalized seizures lasted longer in 
epileptic (p<0.05), which were also more frequent than in the naïve group
(p<0.05). As expected, epileptic marmosets experiencing stronger seizures showed 
more NPY- and ΔFosB-immunostained neurons in a number of brain areas associated
with the generation and spread of limbic seizures. Our results suggest that PTZ
induced seizures over an already existing epileptic background constitutes a
reliable and controllable mean for the screening of new AEDs.

BACKGROUND: This study determined the pharmacokinetics of the contrast agent
gadobutrol in marmosets by quantitative MRI to derive guidelines for neuroimaging
protocols.
METHODS: Local concentrations of gadobutrol were determined from consecutive
gradient echo-based mapping of the relaxation rate R1 on a clinical 3T MRI
scanner. Half-time of renal elimination was measured after injection of a triple 
dose of gadobutrol (0.3 mmol/kg) into the saphenous vein. A first-order
single-compartment model was fitted to the measured R1 values and verified by
blood analysis.
RESULTS: Slow injection (1.5 minutes) resulted in an elimination half-time of
26±4 minutes. After bolus injection (15 seconds), elimination was much slower
(62±8 minutes) with 45% larger distribution volumes. Importantly, more gadobutrol
entered the cerebrospinal fluid.
CONCLUSIONS: Slow injection and a latency of about 20 minutes are recommended to 
avoid extravasation. Application of a triple dose of gadobutrol compensates for
the fast elimination in healthy marmosets.

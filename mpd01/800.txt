:  Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania sp. are important protozoan parasites for
humans and animals in the Americas, causing Chagas disease and cutaneous or
visceral leishmaniasis, respectively. These vector-borne diseases affect
permanent and transient populations in developing tropical countries that exhibit
favorable conditions for the perpetuation of the parasite cycle. Our objective
was to investigate the occurrence of infection with these parasites in wild
animals from urban rainforest fragments in the city of Salvador, the largest city
in the northeast region of Brazil. Sixty-five wild animals were captured,
clinically examined, and sampled for parasite detection by PCR and culture. Ten
different mammalian genera were identified, being 58% (38/65) marsupials. The
prevalence of T. cruzi and Leishmania sp. infections was 13% and 43%,
respectively. Both parasites were detected by PCR in 11% (7/65), three of which
were also double infected as determined by culture. Among the 28 animals found
infected with at least one parasite (43%, 28/65), 68% (19/28) were marsupials,
two specimens were Callithrix sp. (7%), and one was Trinomys sp. (3%). Most
infected animals (89%) had no clinical signs of disease. We found that healthy
free-living animals from urban rainforest fragments harbored pathogenic
trypanosomatids and should be included in epidemiology studies of diseases in big
cities in tropical countries, as these cities grow and engulf rainforest
remnants.

Viruses express several classes of non-coding RNAs; the functions and mechanisms 
by which most of these act are unknown. Herpesvirus saimiri, a γ-herpesvirus that
establishes latency in the T cells of New World primates and has the ability to
cause aggressive leukaemias and lymphomas in non-natural hosts, expresses seven
small nuclear uracil-rich non-coding RNAs (called HSURs) in latently infected
cells. These HSURs associate with Sm proteins, and share biogenesis and
structural features with cellular Sm-class small nuclear RNAs. One of these HSURs
(HSUR2) base-pairs with two host cellular microRNAs (miR-142-3p and miR-16) but
does not affect their abundance or activity, which suggests that its interactions
with them perform alternative functions. Here we show that HSUR2 also base-pairs 
with mRNAs in infected cells. We combined in vivo psoralen-mediated RNA-RNA
crosslinking and high-throughput sequencing to identify the mRNAs targeted by
HSUR2, which include mRNAs that encode retinoblastoma and factors involved in p53
signalling and apoptosis. We show that HSUR2 represses the expression of target
mRNAs and that base-pairing between HSUR2 and miR-142-3p and miR-16 is essential 
for this repression, suggesting that HSUR2 recruits these two cellular microRNAs 
to its target mRNAs. Furthermore, we show that HSUR2 uses this mechanism to
inhibit apoptosis. Our results uncover a role for this viral Sm-class RNA as a
microRNA adaptor in the regulation of gene expression that follows precursor mRNA
processing.

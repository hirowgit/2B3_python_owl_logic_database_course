Human alphaherpesvirus 1 (HuAHV1) causes fatal neurologic infections in captive
New World primates. To determine risks for interspecies transmission, we examined
data for 13 free-ranging, black-tufted marmosets (Callithrix penicillata) that
died of HuAHV1 infection and had been in close contact with humans in anthropized
areas in Brazil during 2012-2019. We evaluated pathologic changes in the
marmosets, localized virus and antigen, and assessed epidemiologic features. The 
main clinical findings were neurologic signs, necrotizing meningoencephalitis,
and ulcerative glossitis; 1 animal had necrotizing hepatitis. Transmission
electron microscopy revealed intranuclear herpetic inclusions, and immunostaining
revealed HuAHV1 and herpesvirus particles in neurons, glial cells, tongue mucosal
epithelium, and hepatocytes. PCR confirmed HuAHV1 infection. These findings
illustrate how disruption of the One Health equilibrium in anthropized
environments poses risks for interspecies virus transmission with potential
spillover not only from animals to humans but also from humans to free-ranging
nonhuman primates or other animals.

Chronic gastrointestinal (GI) diseases are the most common diseases in captive
common marmosets. To understand the role of the microbiome in GI diseases, we
characterized the gut microbiome of 91 healthy marmosets (303 samples) and 59
marmosets diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (200 samples). Healthy 
marmosets exhibited "humanized," Bacteroidetes-dominant microbiomes. After up to 
2 years of standardized diet, housing and husbandry, marmoset microbiomes could
be classified into four distinct marmoset sources based on Prevotella and
Bacteroides levels. Using a random forest (RF) model, marmosets were classified
by source with an accuracy of 93% with 100% sensitivity and 95% specificity using
abundance data from 4 Prevotellaceae amplicon sequence variants (ASVs), as well
as single ASVs from Coprobacter, Parabacteroides, Paraprevotella,
Phascolarctobacterium, Oribacterium and Fusobacterium. A single dysbiotic IBD
state was not found across all marmoset sources, but IBD was associated with
lower alpha diversity and a lower Bacteroides:Prevotella copri ratio within each 
source. IBD was highest in a Prevotella-dominant cohort, and consistent with
Prevotella-linked diseases, pro-inflammatory genes in the jejunum were
upregulated. RF analysis of serum biomarkers identified serum calcium, hemoglobin
and red blood cell (RBC) counts as potential biomarkers for marmoset IBD. This
study characterizes the microbiome of healthy captive common marmosets and
demonstrates that source-specific microbiomes can be retained despite
standardized diets and husbandry practices. Marmosets with IBD had decreased
alpha diversity and a shift in the ratio of Bacteroides:Prevotella copri compared
to healthy marmosets.

Matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors of general formula (1) were synthesised by a 
route involving an Ireland-Claisen rearrangement which enables systematic
modification of the substituent alpha to the hydroxamic acid. An analogue (12c)
possessing an alpha-cyclopentyl group is a potent broad spectrum inhibitor that
displays high and sustained blood levels following oral dosing in both the rat
and marmoset ex-vivo bioassays. This compound and analogues are also potent
inhibitors of TNF alpha release.

The two geminal ethyl groups in the succinic acid moiety of CGP57698
(4-[3-(7-fluoro-2-quinolinyl-methoxy)phenyl-amino]-2,2-diethyl-4-oxo- butanoic
acid) are responsible for the high in vitro and in vivo potency of this
peptidoleukotriene antagonist of the quinoline type. The synthesis and structure 
activity relationships of CGP57698 and its analogs are described.

Ten Bifidobacterium strains, i.e., 6T3, 64T4, 79T10, 80T4, 81T8, 82T1, 82T10,
82T18, 82T24, and 82T25, were isolated from mantled guereza (Colobus guereza),
Sumatran orangutan (Pongo abeli), silvery marmoset (Mico argentatus), golden lion
tamarin (Leontopithecus rosalia), pied tamarin (Saguinus bicolor), and common
pheasant (Phaisanus colchinus). Cells are Gram-positive, non-motile,
non-sporulating, facultative anaerobic, and fructose 6-phosphate
phosphoketolase-positive. Phylogenetic analyses based on the core genome
sequences revealed that isolated strains exhibit close phylogenetic relatedness
with Bifidobacterium genus members belonging to the Bifidobacterium bifidum,
Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium pullorum, and Bifidobacterium tissieri
phylogenetic groups. Phenotypic characterization and genotyping based on the
genome sequences clearly show that these strains are distinct from each of the
type strains of the so far recognized Bifidobacterium species. Thus, B. phasiani 
sp. nov. (6T3 = LMG 32224T = DSM 112544T), B. pongonis sp. nov. (64T4 = LMG
32281T = DSM 112547T), B. saguinibicoloris sp. nov. (79T10 = LMG 32232T = DSM
112543T), B. colobi sp. nov. (80T4 = LMG 32225T = DSM 112552T), B. simiiventris
sp. nov. (81T8 = LMG 32226T = DSM 112549T), B. santillanense sp. nov. (82T1 = LMG
32284T = DSM 112550T), B. miconis sp. nov. (82T10 = LMG 32282T = DSM 112551T), B.
amazonense sp. nov. (82T18 = LMG 32297T = DSM 112548T), pluvialisilvae sp. nov.
(82T24 = LMG 32229T = DSM 112545T), and B. miconisargentati sp. nov. (82T25 = LMG
32283T = DSM 112546T) are proposed as novel Bifidobacterium species.

Nonhuman primates (NHP) are important translational models for cardiac aging. To 
assess progress in this research area and to provide a reference for other
investigators, we identified papers indexed in PubMed to determine what species, 
ages, outcomes, treatments, and approaches have been studied. Since 1983, 33
studies of cardiac aging in NHP have been published. Of these, 27 used species of
macaque, 6 baboon, 1 vervet, 1 orangutan, and 1 marmoset (some studies were
multispecies). Common research approaches were echocardiography, ECG, and
histology of the left ventricle. Only 10 studies performed sex-based analyses.
The average age of the oldest macaque studied was 26 y. The reported mean
lifespan of macaques in captivity is around 30 y. The age of the oldest baboon
studied was 24 y. Baboons in captivity are reported to live on average to 21 y.
Twelve studies took a "life course" approach, studying animals of a wide range of
ages from less than or equal to 10 y through the late teens to thirties, and
employing analyses designed to show change over time. Keeping NHP into old age is
a major challenge for biomedical research. The ideal design is to start
monitoring in early life and to track how cardiac structure and function change
with age. Important issues for future research are an increased focus on
life-course approaches, investment in existing life-course NHP cohorts, better
reporting of study sample characteristics, more molecular studies to identify
genetic risk factors and mechanisms, attention to sex as a biological variable, a
move away from descriptive reports to mechanistic studies, development of
biomarkers to predict disease risk, and exploration of interventions that are
implemented early in life to prevent or delay age-related disease later in life. 
Reducing exposure to early life adversity, identifying early-life biomarkers of
aging and age-related disease, and early treatment can contribute to longer
health span.

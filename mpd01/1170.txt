Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) continues to be a threat 
to human health in the Middle East. Development of countermeasures is ongoing;
however, an animal model that faithfully recapitulates human disease has yet to
be defined. A recent study indicated that inoculation of common marmosets
resulted in inconsistent lethality. Based on these data we sought to compare two 
isolates of MERS-CoV. We followed disease progression in common marmosets after
intratracheal exposure with: MERS-CoV-EMC/2012, MERS-CoV-Jordan-n3/2012, media,
or inactivated virus. Our data suggest that common marmosets developed a mild to 
moderate non-lethal respiratory disease, which was quantifiable by computed
tomography (CT), with limited other clinical signs. Based on CT data, clinical
data, and virological data, MERS-CoV inoculation of common marmosets results in
mild to moderate clinical signs of disease that are likely due to manipulations
of the marmoset rather than as a result of robust viral replication.

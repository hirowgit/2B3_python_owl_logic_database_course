Fabry disease is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by the deficiency of
α-galactosidase A. Enzyme deficiency results in a progressive decline in renal
and cardiac function, leading to cardiomyopathy and end-stage renal disease.
Current treatments available, including enzyme replacement therapies, have
provided significant benefit to patients; however, unmet medical needs remain.
mRNA therapy, with drug-like properties, has the unique ability to produce
therapeutic proteins endogenously. Here we describe the sustained delivery of
therapeutic human α-galactosidase protein in vivo via nanoparticle-formulated
mRNA in mouse and non-human primate, with a demonstration of efficacy through
clinically relevant biomarker reduction in a mouse Fabry disease model.
Multi-component nanoparticles formulated with lipids and lipid-like materials
were developed for the delivery of mRNA encoding human α-galactosidase protein.
Upon delivery of human GLA mRNA to mice, serum GLA protein levels reached as high
as ∼1,330-fold over normal physiological values.

The relationship between socially monogamous mates is dynamic and regulated by
neurobiological influences. Research in rodent models has indicated a key role
for the neurotransmitter dopamine (DA) and its receptors (DAR) in mediating the
formation and maintenance of monogamous bonds. DAR activation was
pharmacologically manipulated in marmosets housed in long-term pairs. Marmosets
exposed to DAR manipulation were tested in a partner preference test under two
social conditions: one in which their mate could visually observe their
interactions with an opposite-sex individual, and one in which their pair mate
could not visually observe these interactions. Marmosets displayed a spatial
preference for the mate compared to an unfamiliar conspecific, however, they
displayed a sexual preference for an unfamiliar conspecific over their mate. D1R 
manipulation had no impact on marmoset partner preference. However, activation of
D2Rs reduced the time marmosets spent in contact with either stimulus animal,
indicating a decrease in social interest, but did not reduce time spent in
proximity to the stimulus animals nor number of sexual solicitations.
Additionally, social context (visibility of the mate) did not influence marmoset 
behavior. These findings suggest that D2Rs may be involved in regulating
generalized, but not partner-specific, social interest in marmoset monkeys.

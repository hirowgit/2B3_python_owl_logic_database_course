The distribution of mossy fiber terminals in the regio inferior of the
hippocampus of Callithrix jacchus was studied by means of Timm's method. The
topographic distribution of Timm-positive zones in the hilus, in the
suprapyramidal and intrapyramidal areas of the CA3 subfield is described. A
Timm-positive reaction in intragranular strips and supragranular zones, the
presence of Timm-negative zones in the infragranular border of the fascia dentata
were found in this species. A comparison between mossy fiber distribution in
Callithrix jacchus and that in human was carried out in an attempt to identify
interspecies differences in the mossy fiber system in the hippocampus of
primates. The hypothesis of a possible functional relevance of the supra- and
intrapyramidal mossy fiber terminals on the control of hippocampal pyramidal
neurons is expressed.

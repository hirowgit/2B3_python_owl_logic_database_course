Previous studies have demonstrated that single neurons in the central nucleus of 
the inferior colliculus (ICC) are sensitive to multiple sound localization cues. 
We investigated the hypothesis that ICC neurons are specialized to encode
multiple sound localization cues that are aligned in space (as would naturally
occur from a single broadband sound source). Sound localization cues including
interaural time differences (ITDs), interaural level differences (ILDs), and
spectral shapes (SSs) were measured in a marmoset monkey. Virtual space methods
were used to generate stimuli with aligned and misaligned combinations of cues
while recording in the ICC of the same monkey. Mutual information (MI) between
spike rates and stimuli for aligned versus misaligned cues were compared. Neurons
with best frequencies (BFs) less than âˆ¼11 kHz mostly encoded information about a 
single sound localization cue, ITD or ILD depending on frequency, consistent with
the dominance of ear acoustics by either ITD or ILD at those frequencies. Most
neurons with BFs >11 kHz encoded information about multiple sound localization
cues, usually ILD and SS, and were sensitive to their alignment. In some neurons 
MI between stimuli and spike responses was greater for aligned cues, while in
others it was greater for misaligned cues. If SS cues were shifted to lower
frequencies in the virtual space stimuli, a similar result was found for neurons 
with BFs <11 kHz, showing that the cue interaction reflects the spectra of the
stimuli and not a specialization for representing SS cues. In general the results
show that ICC neurons are sensitive to multiple localization cues if they are
simultaneously present in the frequency response area of the neuron. However, the
representation is diffuse in that there is not a specialization in the ICC for
encoding aligned sound localization cues.

Prolonged exposure to an effective stimulus generally reduces the sensitivity of 
neurons early in the visual pathway. Yet eye and head movements bring about
frequent changes in the retinal image, and it is less clear that exposure to
brief presentations will produce similar desensitization. To address this, we
made extracellular recordings from single neurons in the lateral geniculate
nucleus of anesthetized marmosets, a New World primate. We measured the contrast 
response for drifting gratings before and after 0.5-s exposure to a high-contrast
drifting grating, a stationary grating, or a blank screen. Prior exposure to the 
drifting grating reduced the contrast sensitivity of cells in the magnocellular
pathway, on average by 23%; this reduction remained strong when the adapting and 
test stimuli were separated by 0.4 s. Exposure to a stationary grating of the
preferred spatial phase did not change the contrast response; exposure to the
opposite spatial phase did. None of the brief adaptors reduced the sensitivity of
parvocellular cells. We conclude that brief periods of high contrast, such as
those that would be expected to occur during a normal visual fixation, are
sufficient to reduce the sensitivity of magnocellular-pathway cells.

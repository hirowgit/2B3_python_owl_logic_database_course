The mediodorsal thalamus (MD) is a higher-order nucleus located within the
central thalamus in many mammalian species. Emerging evidence from MD lesions and
tracer injections suggests that the MD is reciprocally connected to the
prefrontal cortex (PFC) and plays an essential role in specific cognitive
processes and tasks. MD subdivisions (medial, central, and lateral) are poorly
segregated at the molecular level in rodents, leading to a lack of MD
subdivision-specific Cre driver mice. Moreover, this lack of molecular
identifiers hinders MD subdivision- and cell-type-specific circuit formation and 
function analysis. Therefore, using publicly available databases, we explored
molecules separately expressed in MD subdivisions. In addition to MD subdivision 
markers, we identified several genes expressed in a subdivision-specific
combination and classified them. Furthermore, after developing medial MD (MDm) or
central MD (MDc) region-specific Cre mouse lines, we identified diverse region-
and layer-specific PFC projection patterns. Comparison between classified MD
marker genes in mice and common marmosets, a nonhuman primate model, revealed
diverging gene expression patterns. These results highlight the species-specific 
organization of cell types and their projections in the MD thalamus.

Cynomolgus macaque (Macaca fascicularis) and common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus)
have been widely used in human biomedical research. Long-standing primate genome 
assemblies used the human genome as a reference for ordering and orienting the
assembled fragments into chromosomes. Here we performed de novo genome assembly
of these two species without any human genome-based bias observed in the genome
assemblies released earlier. We assembled PacBio long reads, and the resultant
contigs were scaffolded with Hi-C data, which were further refined based on Hi-C 
contact maps and alternate de novo assemblies. The assemblies achieved scaffold
N50 lengths of 149 Mb and 137 Mb for cynomolgus macaque and common marmoset,
respectively. The high fidelity of our assembly is also ascertained by BAC-end
concordance in common marmoset. Our assembly of cynomolgus macaque outperformed
all the available assemblies of this species in terms of contiguity. The
chromosome-scale genome assemblies produced in this study are valuable resources 
for non-human primate models and provide an important baseline in human
biomedical research.

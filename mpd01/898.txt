Wasting marmoset syndrome (WMS) has high incidence and mortality rates and is one
of the most important problems in captive common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus)
colonies. Despite several reports on WMS, little information is available
regarding its reliable treatment. We previously reported that marmosets with WMS 
had high serum levels of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9). MMP9 is thought to be
a key enzyme in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease, the main disease 
state of WMS, and is activated by plasmin, a fibrinolytic factor. In a previous
study, treating mice with an antibody to inhibit plasmin prevented the
progression of inflammatory bowel disease. Here we examined the efficacy of
tranexamic acid, a commonly used plasmin inhibitor, for the treatment of WMS,
with supportive measures including amino acid and iron formulations. Six colony
marmosets with WMS received tranexamic acid therapy with supportive measures for 
8 wk. The body weight, Hct, and serum albumin levels of these 6 marmosets were
increased and serum MMP9 levels decreased after this regimen. Therefore,
tranexamic acid therapy may be a new and useful treatment for WMS.

Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are capable of providing an unlimited
source of cells from all three germ layers and germ cells. The derivation and
usage of iPSCs from various animal models may facilitate stem cell-based therapy,
gene-modified animal production, and evolutionary studies assessing interspecies 
differences. However, there is a lack of species-wide methods for deriving iPSCs,
in particular by means of non-viral and non-transgene-integrating (NTI)
approaches. Here, we demonstrate the iPSC derivation from somatic fibroblasts of 
multiple mammalian species from three different taxonomic orders, including the
common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) in Primates, the dog (Canis lupus
familiaris) in Carnivora, and the pig (Sus scrofa) in Cetartiodactyla, by
combinatorial usage of chemical compounds and NTI episomal vectors.
Interestingly, the fibroblasts temporarily acquired a neural stem cell-like state
during the reprogramming. Collectively, our method, robustly applicable to
various species, holds a great potential for facilitating stem cell-based
research using various animals in Mammalia.

A crucial component of social cognition is to observe and understand the social
interactions of other individuals. A promising nonhuman primate model for
investigating the neural basis of social interaction observation is the common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a small New World primate that shares a rich
social repertoire with humans. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance
imaging acquired at 9.4 T to map the brain areas activated by social interaction 
observation in awake marmosets. We discovered a network of subcortical and
cortical areas, predominately in the anterior lateral frontal and medial frontal 
cortex, that was specifically activated by social interaction observation. This
network resembled that recently identified in Old World macaque monkeys. Our
findings suggest that this network is largely conserved between New and Old World
primates and support the use of marmosets for studying the neural basis of social
cognition.

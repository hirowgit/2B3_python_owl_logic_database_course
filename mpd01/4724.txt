Respiratory disease associated with parainfluenza Type I (Sendai) virus in a
colony of marmosets (Callithrix jacchus).

Flecknell PA, Parry R, Needham JR, Ridley RM, Baker HF, Bowes P.

An outbreak of acute respiratory disease was observed in a colony of marmosets
(Callithrix jacchus). Parainfluenza Type I (Sendai) virus was isolated from the
lungs and from throat swabs of 2 animals which showed clinical signs of disease. 
A rising titre of serum neutralizing antibody to the virus isolated was detected 
in several affected animals. Approximately 50% of the colony showed clinical
signs of disease, and 3 animals died. The duration of illness ranged from 3 to 16
days.

Histopathology of experimental Legionnaires' disease in guinea pigs, rhesus
monkeys and marmosets.

Baskerville A, Fitzgeorge RB, Broster M, Hambleton P.

Guinea pigs, rhesus monkeys and marmosets were infected with L. pneumophila in
small particle aerosols. Fever and acute fibrinopurulent pneumonia resulted. The 
lesions involved distal lung tissue only, spreading from terminal and respiratory
bronchioles and producing heavy infiltration of alveoli by polymorphs and
macrophages and widespread exudation of oedema fluid and fibrin. Lesions were not
found in extra-pulmonary sites.

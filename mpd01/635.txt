Effort-based decision-making paradigms have recently been used to measure
motivation in healthy subjects and patients with neuropsychiatric disorders. In
the present study, we developed a novel effort-discounting paradigm using a
touch-panel system in common marmosets. Marmosets were trained to choose between 
a low-reward (a piece of cake) requiring low-effort (one touch response) versus
high-reward (three pieces of cake) requiring one of three different effort levels
(one, two, or four touch responses). Because the number of trials per session was
kept constant, the selection of the high-reward choice was always the optimal
strategy to receive the maximum number of rewards. Marmosets' high-reward rates
were reduced as the physical effort requirement was increased, when they were
tested using effort discounting in either ascending or descending order of effort
intensity. It indicates that marmosets' decisions could be attributable to
cost-benefit evaluation, but not to their fatigue or satisfaction with the reward
during the progression of the paradigm. The high dose of dopamine D₁ receptor
antagonist SCH-39166 (0.03 mg/kg) reduced the high-reward choice rate, only when 
more effort was required to obtain the high-reward than the low-reward. On the
other hand, the D₂ receptor antagonist raclopride (0.01 and 0.03 mg/kg)
unexpectedly did not affect the high-reward choice rate, but the high dose did
increase omission rate. Our finding suggests that dopamine D₁ receptor signaling 
may play a more important role in effort-based decision making than D₂ receptor
signaling in marmosets. Our novel behavioral paradigm would be useful in
translational research focused on motivational deficits. (PsycINFO Database

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Bupropion is an atypical antidepressant and smoking
cessation aid associated with wide intersubject variability. This study compared 
the formation kinetics of three phase I metabolites (hydroxybupropion,
threohydrobupropion, and erythrohydrobupropion) in human, marmoset, rat, and
mouse liver microsomes. The objective was to establish suitability and
limitations  for subsequent use of nonclinical species to model bupropion central
nervous system (CNS) disposition in humans.
METHODS: Hepatic microsomal incubations were conducted separately for the R- and 
S-bupropion enantiomers, and the formation of enantiomer-specific metabolites was
determined using LC-MS/MS. Intrinsic formation clearance (CLint) of metabolites
across the four species was determined from the formation rate versus substrate
concentration relationship.
RESULTS: The total clearance of S-bupropion was higher than that of R-bupropion
in monkey and human liver microsomes. The contribution of hydroxybupropion to the
total racemic bupropion clearance was 38%, 62%, 17%, and 96% in human, monkey,
rat, and mouse, respectively.  In the same species order, threohydrobupropion
contributed 53%, 23%, 17%, and 3%, and erythrohydrobupropion contributed 9%, 14%,
66%, and 1.3%, respectively, to racemic bupropion clearance.
CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate that phase I metabolism in monkeys best
approximates that observed in humans, and support the preferred use of this
species to investigate possible pharmacokinetic factors that influence the CNS
disposition of bupropion and contribute to its high intersubject variability.

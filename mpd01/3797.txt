In isozyme systems in general, the pattern of tissue-dependent expression of a
given type of isozyme is uniform in various mammalian species. In contrast, a
major cytosolic aldehyde dehydrogenase isozyme, termed ALDH1, which is strongly
expressed in the livers of humans and other mammals, is hardly detectable in rat 
liver. Thirteen nucleotides existing in the 5'-promoter region of human,
marmoset, and mouse ALDH1 genes are absent in the four rat strains examined. When
the 13 nucleotides were deleted from a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase
expression construct, which contained the 5'-promoter region of the human ALDH1
gene and a low-background promoterless chloramphenicol acetyltransferase
expression vector, the expression activity was severely diminished in human
hepatic cells. Thus, deletion of the 13 nucleotides in the promoter region of the
gene can account for the lack of ALDH1 expression in rat liver.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Bupropion is an atypical antidepressant and smoking
cessation aid associated with wide intersubject variability. This study compared 
the formation kinetics of three phase I metabolites (hydroxybupropion,
threohydrobupropion, and erythrohydrobupropion) in human, marmoset, rat, and
mouse liver microsomes. The objective was to establish suitability and
limitations  for subsequent use of nonclinical species to model bupropion central
nervous system (CNS) disposition in humans.
METHODS: Hepatic microsomal incubations were conducted separately for the R- and 
S-bupropion enantiomers, and the formation of enantiomer-specific metabolites was
determined using LC-MS/MS. Intrinsic formation clearance (CLint) of metabolites
across the four species was determined from the formation rate versus substrate
concentration relationship.
RESULTS: The total clearance of S-bupropion was higher than that of R-bupropion
in monkey and human liver microsomes. The contribution of hydroxybupropion to the
total racemic bupropion clearance was 38%, 62%, 17%, and 96% in human, monkey,
rat, and mouse, respectively.  In the same species order, threohydrobupropion
contributed 53%, 23%, 17%, and 3%, and erythrohydrobupropion contributed 9%, 14%,
66%, and 1.3%, respectively, to racemic bupropion clearance.
CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate that phase I metabolism in monkeys best
approximates that observed in humans, and support the preferred use of this
species to investigate possible pharmacokinetic factors that influence the CNS
disposition of bupropion and contribute to its high intersubject variability.

Rabies virus (RABV) does not persist in the environment as it is a very fragile
agent. The primary hosts are mammalian species in the orders Carnivora and
Chiroptera. Since the late 1980s, RABV has been isolated from non-human primates,
Callithrix jacchus (the white-tufted marmoset), in four coastal states (Rio
Grande do Norte, Ceará, Piauí and Pernambuco) in north-eastern Brazil, where this
species is indigenous. The original habitat of C. jacchus consisted of two
Brazilian biomes, the Atlantic Forest and the Caatinga. However, these marmosets 
have since adapted to other ecosystems as a result of human activities. Between
1988 and 1989, RABV isolates were obtained from white-tufted marmosets in the
state of Rio Grande do Norte, but antigenic and genetic identification studies
were not conducted at that time. In the following years, three additional states 
reported cases (Ceará, Piauí and Pernambuco). In two of these states (Ceará and
Piauí), human cases of rabies transmitted by marmosets were reported. According
to Brazilian Health Ministry data, at least 19 human cases in which this species 
was the source of infection were registered in between 1990 and 2016. Recent
findings in laboratory tests of 12 rabid samples from humans and marmosets and
the regional transmission among these animals for over 20 years, together with
the gradual increase in the affected geographic area, support the concept of the 
emergence of a new RABV reservoir. Regional tourism, the wild animal trade and
the cultural practice of maintaining these animals as pets, particularly in
coastal regions, appear to be major risk factors for the increase in human cases.
Additional epidemiological and ecological studies are required to better
understand local disease dynamics and to identify ideal opportunities for
prevention and control of this fatal infection.

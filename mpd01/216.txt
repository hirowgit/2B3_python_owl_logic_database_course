BACKGROUND: Anhedonia, the loss of pleasure in previously rewarding activities,
is a prominent feature of major depressive disorder and often resistant to
first-line antidepressant treatment. A paucity of translatable cross-species
tasks to assess subdomains of anhedonia, including reward learning, presents a
major obstacle to the development of effective therapeutics. One assay of reward 
learning characterized by orderly behavioral and pharmacological findings in both
humans and rats is the probabilistic reward task. In this computerized task,
subjects make discriminations across numerous trials in which correct responses
to one alternative are rewarded more often (rich) than correct responses to the
other (lean). Healthy control subjects reliably develop a response bias to the
rich alternative. However, participants with major depressive disorder as well as
rats exposed to chronic stress typically exhibit a blunted response bias.
METHODS: The present studies validated a touchscreen-based probabilistic reward
task for the marmoset, a small nonhuman primate with considerable translational
value. First, probabilistic reinforcement contingencies were parametrically
examined. Next, the effects of ketamine (1.0-10.0 mg/kg), a US Food and Drug
Administration-approved rapid-acting antidepressant, and phencyclidine (0.01-0.1 
mg/kg), a pharmacologically similar N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist with
no known antidepressant efficacy, were evaluated.
RESULTS: Increases in the asymmetry of rich:lean probabilistic contingencies
produced orderly increases in response bias. Consistent with their respective
clinical profiles, ketamine but not phencyclidine produced dose-related increases
in response bias at doses that did not reduce task discriminability.
CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these findings confirm task and pharmacological
sensitivity in the marmoset, which may be useful in developing medications to
counter anhedonia across neuropsychiatric disorders.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common cause of cancer-related deaths largely due to
CRC liver metastasis (CRLM). Identification of targetable mechanisms continues
and includes investigations into the role of inflammatory pathways. Of interest, 
MAPK is aberrantly expressed in CRC patients, yet the activation status is not
defined. The present study assessed p38γ activation in CRC patients, cancer
cells, and tissues of cotton top tamarin (CTT) and common marmoset (CM). The
primate world is an overlooked resource as colitis-CRC-prone CTT are usually
inure to liver metastasis while CM develop colitis but not CRC. The results
demonstrate that p38γ protein and phosphorylation levels are significantly
increased in CRC patients compared to normal subjects and CTT. Furthermore, p38γ 
phosphorylation is significantly elevated in human CRC cells and hepatoblastoma
cells but not in CM colon. Additionally, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and
biliary glycoprotein (BGP) are induced in the CRC patients that showed p38γ
phosphorylation. Inhibition of p38 MAPK in CRC cells showed a significant decline
in cell growth with no effect on apoptosis or BGP level. Overall, p38γ is
activated in CRC tumorigenesis and likely involves CEA antigens during CRLM in
humans but not in the CTT or CM, that rarely develop CRLM.

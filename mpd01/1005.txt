PURPOSE: The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a New World primate of
increasing interest to neuroscience and in translational brain research. The
present work describes the design and implementation of individualized 8-channel 
receive-only radiofrequency (RF) coil arrays that provide whole-brain coverage
and allow anatomical and functional MRI experiments in conscious, awake
marmosets.
METHODS: The coil arrays were designed with their elements embedded inside
individualized restraint helmets. The size, geometry, and arrangement of the coil
elements were optimized to allow whole-brain coverage. Coil-to-coil decoupling
was achieved by a combination of geometric decoupling and low input impedance
preamplifiers. The performance of the embedded arrays was compared against that
of one 8-channel receive-only array built to fit the external surface of the
helmets.
RESULTS: Three individualized helmets with embedded coil arrays were built for
three marmosets. Whole-brain coverage was achieved with high sensitivity
extending over the entire cortex. Visual stimulation of conscious awake marmosets
elicited robust BOLD fMRI responses in both primary and higher order visual areas
of the occipitotemporal cortex.
CONCLUSION: The high sensitivity provided by embedded receive-only coil arrays
allows both anatomical and functional MRI data to be obtained with high spatial
resolution in conscious, awake marmosets. Magn Reson Med 78:387-398, 2017. © 2016

Common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) are frequently used for biomedical research
but can be afflicted with diarrhea-a serious and potentially lethal health
problem. Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) is thought to be the causative 
pathogen of hemorrhagic typhlocolitis in common marmosets, but the actual
incidence of the disease and the relationship between EPEC and hematochezia are
unknown. This study investigated the prevalence of EPEC infection in common
marmosets and the association between EPEC and hematochezia. A total of 230 stool
or rectal swab samples were collected from 230 common marmosets (98 clinically
healthy, 85 diarrhea, and 47 bloody stool samples) and tested by culture-based
detection and PCR amplification of VT1, VT2, LT, ST, eae, and bfp genes. Healthy 
animals were divided into three groups (n = 4 each for high and low concentration
groups and n = 2 as negative control), and those in the experimental groups were 
perorally inoculated with a 2-ml of suspension of EPEC R811 strain adjusted to 5 
× 108 (high concentration) and 5 × 104 (low concentration) CFU/ ml. Two animals
in each group were examined 3 and 14 days post-inoculation (DPI). EPEC was
detected in 10 of 98 clinically healthy samples (10.2%), 17 of 85 diarrhea
samples (20%), and all 47 bloody stool samples (100%), with a significant
difference detected between presence of EPEC and sample status (P < 0.01). Acute 
hematochezia was observed in all animals of the high-concentration group but not 
in other groups at 1 or 2 DPI. A histopathological examination revealed the
attachment of gram-negative bacilli to epithelial apical membranes and
desquamated epithelial cells in the cecum of animals in the high-concentration
group at 3 DPI. These findings suggest that EPEC is a causative agent of
hemorrhagic typhlocolitis in common marmosets.

Ebola virus (EBOV) causes a highly infectious and lethal hemorrhagic fever in
primates with high fatality rates during outbreaks and EBOV may be exploited as a
potential biothreat pathogen. There is therefore a need to develop and license
appropriate medical countermeasures against this virus. To determine whether the 
common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) would be an appropriate model to assess
vaccines or therapies against EBOV disease (EVD), initial susceptibility,
lethality and pathogenesis studies were performed. Low doses of EBOV-Kikwit,
between 4 and 27 times the 50% tissue culture infectious dose, were sufficient to
cause a lethal, reproducible infection. Animals became febrile between days 5 and
6, maintaining a high fever before succumbing to EVD between 6 and 8 days after
challenge. Typical signs of EVD were observed. Pathogenesis studies revealed that
virus was isolated from the lungs of animals beginning on day 3 after challenge
and from the liver, spleen and blood beginning on day 5. The most striking
features were observed in animals that succumbed to infection, including high
viral titers in all organs, increased levels of liver function enzymes and blood 
clotting times, decreased levels of platelets, multifocal moderate to severe
hepatitis, and perivascular edema.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common cause for sustained disability in
young adults, yet treatment options remain very limited. Although numerous
therapeutic approaches have been effective in rodent models of experimental
autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), only few proved to be beneficial in patients 
with MS. Hence, there is a strong need for more predictive animal models. Within 
the past decade, EAE in the common marmoset evolved as a potent, alternative
model for MS, with immunological and pathological features resembling more
closely the human disease. However, an often very rapid and severe disease course
hampers its implementation for systematic testing of new treatment strategies. We
here developed a new focal model of EAE in the common marmoset, induced by myelin
oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) immunization and stereotactic injections of
proinflammatory cytokines. At the injection site of cytokines, confluent
inflammatory demyelinating lesions developed that strongly resembled human MS
lesions. In a proof-of-principle treatment study with the immunomodulatory
compound laquinimod, we demonstrate that targeted EAE in marmosets provides a
promising and valid tool for preclinical experimental treatment trials in MS
research.

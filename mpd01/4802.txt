Husbandry and breeding of a newly-established colony of cotton-topped tamarins
(Saguinus oedipus oedipus).

Brand HM.

From November 1976 to February 1979 a total of 8 litters were born to 6 females. 
Of the 14 infants, 10 were successfully reared by their parents. Housing,
nutrition, a balance between environmental stability and stimulation, and female 
multiparity are seen as factors contributing to the breeding success of this
colony. A controlled male and female pairing programme provided information on
mating behavior and gestation length. One gestation of at least 166 days was
observed, longer than that of the common marmoset.

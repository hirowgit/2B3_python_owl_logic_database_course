Reproduction, infant survival and productivity of a colony of common marmosets
(Callithrix jacchus jacchus).

Poole TB, Evans RG.

Starting with 4 pairs of marmosets, 204 young were successfully reared during 6
years. They were kept in family groups of 2- 10. Litter size varied from 1-4;
singletons (2%), twins (35%), triplets (55%), and quadruplets (8%). The mean
annual increase of weaned young was 3.24 per pair. The median interbirth interval
was 154 days. Of 46 pairs of marmosets, 8 failed to produce young. Approximately 
11% of young born were stillborn and a further 32% of all young born died within 
3 weeks; perinatal mortality is largely a result of the failure of parents to
rear more than 2 young. In only 2 of 68 triplet births did the parents rear the
young unaided. 53% of young born were males but differential mortality reduced
the final sex ratio for live young to 50-5% males. Females did not accept and
rear the young after caesarian section. The linear regression of the growth curve
for 5-17 months (where y = weight in grams and x = months) could be expressed as 
y = 16.6x + 163.6. The data form 4 marmoset colonies are compared and the
relative efficiency of breeding methods discussed.

Schlafen11 (encoded by the SLFN11 gene) has been shown to inhibit the
accumulation of HIV-1 proteins. We show that the SLFN11 gene is under positive
selection in simian primates and is species-specific in its activity against
HIV-1. The activity of human Schlafen11 is relatively weak compared to that of
some other primate versions of this protein, with the versions encoded by
chimpanzee, orangutan, gibbon, and marmoset being particularly potent inhibitors 
of HIV-1 protein production. Interestingly, we find that Schlafen11 is functional
in the absence of infection and reduces protein production from certain non-viral
(GFP) and even host (Vinculin and GAPDH) transcripts. This suggests that
Schlafen11 may just generally block protein production from non-codon optimized
transcripts. Because Schlafen11 is an interferon-stimulated gene with a broad
ability to inhibit protein production from many host and viral transcripts, its
role may be to create a general antiviral state in the cell. Interestingly, the
strong inhibitors such as marmoset Schlafen11 consistently block protein
production better than weak primate Schlafen11 proteins, regardless of the virus 
or host target being analyzed. Further, we show that the residues to which
species-specific differences in Schlafen11 potency map are distinct from residues
that have been targeted by positive selection. We speculate that the positive
selection of SLFN11 could have been driven by a number of different factors,
including interaction with one or more viral antagonists that have yet to be
identified.

In primate retina, the midget, parasol, and small bistratified cell populations
form the large majority of ganglion cells. In addition, there is a variety of
low-density wide-field ganglion cell types that are less well characterized. Here
we studied retinal ganglion cells in the common marmoset, Callithrix jacchus,
using particle-mediated gene transfer. Ganglion cells were transfected with an
expression plasmid for the postsynaptic density 95-green fluorescent protein. The
retinas were processed with established immunohistochemical markers for bipolar
and/or amacrine cells to determine ganglion cell dendritic stratification. In
total over 500 ganglion cells were classified based on their dendritic field
size, morphology, and stratification in the inner plexiform layer. Over 17 types 
were distinguished, including midget, parasol, broad thorny, small bistratified, 
large bistratified, recursive bistratified, recursive monostratified, narrow
thorny, smooth monostratified, large sparse, giant sparse (melanopsin) ganglion
cells, and a group that may contain several as yet uncharacterized types.
Assuming each characterized type forms a hexagonal mosaic, the midget and parasol
cells account for over 80% of all ganglion cells in the central retina but only
∼50% of cells in the peripheral (>2 mm) retina. We conclude that the fovea is
dominated by midget and parasol cells, but outside the fovea the ganglion cell
diversity in marmoset is likely as great as that reported for nonprimate retinas.
Taken together, the ganglion cell types in marmoset retina resemble those
described previously in macaque retina with respect to morphology,
stratification, and change in proportion across the retina.

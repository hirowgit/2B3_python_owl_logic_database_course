Common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) developed high levels of viremia, clinical 
signs including fever, weight loss, a decrease in activity and hematuria upon
inoculation with dengue virus (DENV). Presence of DENV genome in urine samples
and pathological changes in kidneys were examined in the present study. Levels of
DENV genome were determined in 228 urine samples from 20 primary DENV-inoculated 
marmosets and in 56 urine samples from four secondary DENV-inoculated marmosets. 
DENV genome was detected in 75% (15/20) of marmosets after primary DENV
infection. No DENV genome was detected in urine samples from the marmosets with
secondary infection with homologous DENV (0%, 0/4). Two marmosets demonstrated
hematuria. Pathological analysis of the kidneys demonstrated non-suppressive
interstitial nephritis with renal tubular regeneration. DENV antigen-positive
cells were detected in kidneys. In human dengue virus infections, some patients
present renal symptoms. The results indicate that marmosets recapitulate some
aspects of the involvement of kidneys in human DENV infection, and suggest that
marmosets are potentially useful for the studies of the pathogenesis of DENV
infection, including kidneys.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is amply distributed in the Brazilian
Northeast, but little is known of its ecology in the semi-arid Caatinga
scrublands. The present study provides the first detailed data on the composition
of the diet of C. jacchus in Caatinga ecosystems, derived from observations at
four sites in the state of Sergipe. While exudate sources were gouged at all four
sites in a manner typical of the species, fruit was the principal component of
the diet at the main study site during most months, and a number of unusual items
were eaten, including leaves, and the reproductive parts of cacti and bromeliads.
These plants are rarely recorded in marmoset diets, but are common in caatinga
habitats. Leaves were ingested during 5 of the 8 months monitored at the main
study site, reaching 39.74% of the diet in 1 month, and appeared to be an
alternative fallback food to plant exudates during periods when fruit was scarce.
Three species of cactus provided both flowers and fruits, while the terrestrial
bromeliad, Encholirium spectabile, provided nectar (30.81% of the diet in
November). Approximately half of the plant species (and three families)
identified in this study had not been recorded previously in the diet of
Callithrix. Overall, the data suggest that, while the marmosets exploit the same 
types of plant foods in the Caatinga, the resource base is quite distinct from
that of the Atlantic Forest. Other differences, such as relatively small groups
and large home ranges, may contribute to divergent ecological patterns, which
require more systematic investigation. Am. J. Primatol. 75:333-341, 2013. © 2012

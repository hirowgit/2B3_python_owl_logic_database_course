Overview of viral oncology studies in Saguinus and Callithrix species.

Wolfe LG, Deinhardt F.

Marmoset monkeys are highly susceptible to tumor induction by type C sarcoma
viruses and primate lymphotropic herpeviruses. Six experimental models were
reviewed, three sarcoma models induced by Rous, feline or simian sarcoma viruses 
and three models of lymphoproliferative disease induced by Herpevirus saimiri, H.
ateles or Epstein-Barr virus. Relative susceptibility of cotton-topped (Saguinus 
oedipus oedipus), white-lipped (S. nigricollis, S. fuscicollis subspecies) and
commone (Callithrix jacchus jacchus) marmosets to the different viruses was
compared.

Interleukin-3 (IL-3) genes were cloned from chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), tamarin
(Saguinus oedipus) and marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) and expressed in COS cells. 
Although the IL-3 gene structure is well conserved in these primate species,
sequence analysis revealed extensive base substitutions. The chimpanzee IL-3
protein, which is highly homologous (98.5% identity) to human IL-3, stimulated
proliferation of human cells dependent on IL-3. In contrast, due to the numerous 
amino acid substitutions in the New World monkey IL-3 species, no stimulation of 
human cells was observed, illustrating the extensive evolutionary divergence of
IL-3.

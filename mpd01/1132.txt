The marmosets, tribe Callitrichini, are the most speciose clade in the subfamily 
Callitrichinae, containing 21 species. However, there is no consensus among
molecular and morphological systematists as to how many genera should be
recognized for the group. To test the morphological support for the alternative
generic classifications, this study presents a comprehensive phylogenetic
analysis. It is the first such analysis to include all 21 species and employ
continuous and discrete osteological, pelage and tegument, karyological and vocal
characters. This dataset was combined with nucleotide sequences from two
mitochondrial and four nuclear regions. Separate analyses showed that, among
morphological datasets, osteological characters were best at solving
relationships at more inclusive levels, whilst pelage characters were most
informative at the interspecific level. This suggests the presence of different
transformation rates for the two character sets. When a single most parsimonious 
tree was obtained using the 83-character matrix, three main clades were
identified, supporting the division of the marmosets into three genera:
Callithrix, Cebuella and Mico. The total evidence analysis that included an
additional 3481 molecular characters corroborated most of the morphology-based
clades and also supported a three-genus classification of the marmosets. This is 
the first morphological study to support an Amazonian marmoset clade
(Cebuella + Mico), which is also strongly supported in exclusively molecular
phylogenies, and to synonimize Callibella under Mico.

The first draft of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) genome was published 
by the Marmoset Genome Sequencing and Analysis Consortium. The draft was based on
whole-genome shotgun sequencing, and the current assembly version is
Callithrix_jacches-3.2.1, but there still exist 187,214 undetermined gap regions 
and supercontigs and relatively short contigs that are unmapped to chromosomes in
the draft genome. We performed resequencing and assembly of the genome of common 
marmoset by deep sequencing with high-throughput sequencing technology. Several
different sequence runs using Illumina sequencing platforms were executed, and
181 Gbp of high-quality bases including mate-pairs with long insert lengths of 3,
8, 20, and 40 Kbp were obtained, that is, approximately 60× coverage. The
resequencing significantly improved the MGSAC draft genome sequence. The N50 of
the contigs, which is a statistical measure used to evaluate assembly quality,
doubled. As a result, 51% of the contigs (total length: 299 Mbp) that were
unmapped to chromosomes in the MGSAC draft were merged with chromosomal contigs, 
and the improved genome sequence helped to detect 5,288 new genes that are
homologous to human cDNAs and the gaps in 5,187 transcripts of the Ensembl gene
annotations were completely filled.

We are currently living the advent of a new age for medicine in which basic
research is being quickly translated into marketable drugs, and the widespread
access to genomics data is allowing the design and implementation of personalized
solutions to medical conditions. Non-human primates (NHP) have gained an
essential role in drug discovery and safety testing due to their close
phylogenetic relationship to humans. In this study, a collection of well
characterized genes of the human immune system was used to define the
orthology-based immunome in four NHP species, with carefully curated annotations 
available based on multi-tissue RNA-seq datasets. A broad variation in the
frequency of expressed protein isoforms was observed between species. Finally,
this analysis also revealed the lack of expression of at least four different
chemokines in new-world primates. In addition, transcripts corresponding to four 
genes including interleukin 12 subunit alpha were expressed in humans but no
other primate species analyzed. Access to the non-human primate immunome is
available in http://www.fidic.org.co:90/proyecto/.

BACKGROUND: Objective gait evaluation in humans is used as a predictive
disability outcome measure as well as an indicator for intervention
effectiveness. Parallel methods of gait analysis in nonhuman primate models are
essential for clinical translation. The goal of this study was to first assess
whether marmosets' gait data could be reliably collected in a Noldus CatWalk
XT10.6 and second, establish a testing protocol to assess gait and the
intraindividual variability during repeated testing.
NEW METHOD: The CatWalk, originally developed for rodents, was modified and used 
to assess gait in eight adult common marmoset monkeys across multiple days and
trials. Data was first analyzed to identify valid runs. Repeated measures ANOVA
was completed for the following gait measures: mean base of support, average
stride length, average swing time, and average stance time.
RESULTS: Raters had a high level of concurrence of usable data across all trials 
with successful trials including four consecutive hindfoot footfalls, during a
continuous, uninterrupted segment of walking. A significant main effect of time
(p < 0.000) but not rater (p = 0.98) was present with significant interactions
for time by subject (p < 0.000), but not rater per subject (p = 0.538), time
(p = 0.186), or three-way interaction (p = 0.297).
COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHOD(S): Gait has been assessed using force-plate and 
video data. The CatWalk allowed reproducible, automated and translational
locomotor data to be collected at multiple time points with detailed analyses
that identified a diagonal gait pattern.
CONCLUSIONS: The CatWalk system, similar to those used in humans, can be
effectively used to quantify spatiotemporal characteristics of gait in the common
marmoset.

Experimental intranasal infection of marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) with calpox
virus results in fatal disease. Route and dose used for viral inoculation of the 
test animals mimics the natural transmission of smallpox, thus representing a
suitable model to study pathogenesis and to evaluate new vaccines against
orthopoxvirus infection. However, the pathogenic mechanisms leading to death are 
still unclear. Therefore, our study aimed at investigating the kinetics of
pathological alterations to clarify the pathogenesis in calpox virus infection.
Following intranasal inoculation with two different viral doses, common marmosets
were sacrificed on days 3, 5, 7, 10 and 12 post inoculation. Collected tissue was
screened using histopathology, immunohistochemistry, transmission electron
microscopy, and virological assays. Our data suggest that primary replication
took place in nasal and bronchial epithelia followed by secondary replication in 
submandibular lymph nodes and spleen. Parallel to viremia at day 7, virus was
detectable in many organs, mainly located in epithelial cells and macrophages, as
well as in endothelial cells. Based on the onset of clinical signs, the
histological and ultrastructural lesions and the immunohistochemical distribution
pattern of the virus, the incubation period was defined to last 11 days, which
resembles human smallpox. In conclusion, the data indicate that the calpox model 
is highly suitable for studying orthopoxvirus-induced disease.

The aim of this study was to reevaluate the ecology of an area in the Atlantic
Forest, southeast Brazil, where Chagas disease (CD) has been found to occur. In a
previous study, immediately after the occurrence of a CD case, we did not observe
any sylvatic small mammals or dogs with Trypanosoma cruzi cruzi infections, but
Triatoma vitticeps presented high T. c. cruzi infection rates. In this study, we 
investigated bats together with non-volant mammals, dogs, and triatomines to
explore other possible T. c. cruzi reservoirs/hosts in the area. Seventy-three
non-volant mammals and 186 bats were captured at three sites within the Guarapari
municipality, Espírito Santo state. Rio da Prata and Amarelos sites exhibited
greater richness in terms of non-volant mammals and bats species, respectively.
The marsupial Metachirus nudicaudatus, the rodent Trinomys paratus, and the bats 
Artibeus lituratus and Carollia perspicillata were the most frequently captured
species. As determined by positive hemocultures, only two non-volant mammals were
found to be infected by Trypanosoma species: Monodelphis americana, which was
infected by T. cascavelli, T. dionisii and Trypanosoma sp., and Callithrix
geoffroyi, which was infected by T. minasense. Bats presented T. c. cruzi TcI and
TcIII/V, T. c. marinkellei, T. dionisii, T. rangeli B and D, and Trypanosoma sp. 
infections. Seven dogs were infected with T. cruzi based only on serological
exams. The triatomines T. vitticeps and Panstrongylus geniculatus were found to
be infected by trypanosomes via microscopy. According to molecular
characterization, T. vitticeps specimens were infected with T. c. cruzi TcI,
TcII, TcIII/V, and TcIV, T. c. marinkellei and T. dionisii. We observed high
trypanosome diversity in a small and fragmented region of the Atlantic Forest.
This diversity was primarily maintained by bats and T. vitticeps. Our findings
show that the host specificity of the Trypanosoma genus should be thoroughly
reviewed. In addition, our data show that CD cases can occur without an enzootic 
cycle near residential areas.

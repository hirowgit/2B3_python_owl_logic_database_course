The magnitude of the 2013-2016 Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic enabled an
unprecedented number of viral mutations to occur over successive human-to-human
transmission events, increasing the probability that adaptation to the human host
occurred during the outbreak. We investigated one nonsynonymous mutation, Ebola
virus (EBOV) glycoprotein (GP) mutant A82V, for its effect on viral infectivity. 
This mutation, located at the NPC1-binding site on EBOV GP, occurred early in the
2013-2016 outbreak and rose to high frequency. We found that GP-A82V had
heightened ability to infect primate cells, including human dendritic cells. The 
increased infectivity was restricted to cells that have primate-specific NPC1
sequences at the EBOV interface, suggesting that this mutation was indeed an
adaptation to the human host. GP-A82V was associated with increased mortality,
consistent with the hypothesis that the heightened intrinsic infectivity of
GP-A82V contributed to disease severity during the EVD epidemic.

Primates of the genus Callithrix often obtain exudates from plants of the family 
Fabaceae. This study characterizes the chemical composition of exudates, and the 
anatomy and hystochemistry of the secretory ducts in the bark of Anadenanthera
peregrina (L.) Speg. var. peregrina (Fabaceae). Exudates from this tree species
represent an important component of the diet of hybrid marmosets, Callithrix spp.
(Primates: Cebidae). A. peregrina was selected as the focal study tree because it
is the only gum tree species exploited by Callithrix groups present within five
urban forest fragments in the municipality of Viçosa, Minas Gerais State, Brazil.
Gum samples were obtained directly from gouges made by the marmosets, while bark 
samples were obtained from A. peregrina plants, whether or not they were damaged 
by the marmosets. Constitutive secretory ducts were present in the bark of
ungouged A. peregrina, whereas, marmoset damage caused induced secretory duct
formation and an increase in the size of these ducts. The gum produced in the
gouges made by the marmosets and in ungouged plants reacted positively to tests
for polysaccharides, pectin, mucilage, and proteins. The gum from the gouges
exhibited high water (41.0%), carbohydrate (38.2%), protein (19.0%), and mineral 
(Ca 0.4% and K 0.3%) content. We argue that the relatively high calcium content
of A. peregrina gum plays an important nutritional role in, balancing a diet that
is otherwise rich in phosphorous and poor in calcium.

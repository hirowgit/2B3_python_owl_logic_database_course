Understanding the role of serotonin (or 5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) in aversive
processing has been hampered by the contradictory findings, across studies, of
increased sensitivity to punishment in terms of subsequent response choice but
decreased sensitivity to punishment-induced response suppression following gross 
depletion of central 5-HT. To address this apparent discrepancy, the present
study determined whether both effects could be found in the same animals by
performing localized 5-HT depletions in the amygdala or orbitofrontal cortex
(OFC) of a New World monkey, the common marmoset. 5-HT depletion in the amygdala 
impaired response choice on a probabilistic visual discrimination task by
increasing the effectiveness of misleading, or false, punishment and reward, and 
decreased response suppression in a variable interval test of punishment
sensitivity that employed the same reward and punisher. 5-HT depletion in the OFC
also disrupted probabilistic discrimination learning and decreased response
suppression. Computational modeling of behavior on the discrimination task showed
that the lesions reduced reinforcement sensitivity. A novel, unitary account of
the findings in terms of the causal role of 5-HT in the anticipation of both
negative and positive motivational outcomes is proposed and discussed in relation
to current theories of 5-HT function and our understanding of mood and anxiety
disorders.

Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating condition with no established
treatment. To better understand the pathology and develop a treatment modality
for SCI, an understanding of the physiological changes following SCI at the
molecular level is essential. However, studies on SCI have primarily used rodent 
models, and few studies have examined SCI in non-human primates. In this study,
we analyzed the temporal changes in gene expression patterns following SCI in
common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) using microarray analysis and mRNA deep
sequencing. This analysis revealed that, although the sequence of events is
comparable between primates and rodents, the inflammatory response following SCI 
is significantly prolonged and the onset of glial scar formation is temporally
delayed in primates compared with rodents. These observations indicate that the
optimal time window to treat SCI significantly differs among different species.
This study provides the first extensive analysis of gene expression following SCI
in non-human primates and will serve as a valuable resource in understanding the 
pathology of SCI.

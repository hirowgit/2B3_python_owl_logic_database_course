Human T-cell leukemia virus: transformation in vitro of nonhuman primate
T-lymphocytes and experimental inoculation of nonhuman primates.

Falk LA Jr, Byington R, Silva DP.

T-lymphocytes from three species of New World monkeys were susceptible to
transformation in vitro with human T-cell leukemia virus. Marmoset T-lymphocytes 
transformed in vitro with HVS or HVA, T-lymphotropic herpesviruses of New World
monkeys, were also transformed with HTLV resulting in doubly transformed T-cells.
This finding may provide a potential model for investigating the possible
interaction between a herpesvirus and T-lymphotropic retroviruses in the clinical
condition AIDS.

Presence of pH2-sensitive circulating interferon among Callithrix jacchus
marmosets.

Rhodes-Feuillette A, Mahouy G, Bellosguardo M, Gouget-Zalc C, Périès J.

Significant and relatively stable levels of serum-interferon were demonstrated in
a Callithrix jacchus population. This circulating interferon was acid-sensitive
in all cases, classifying it as immune or "gamma-type" interferon. Our results in
these hematopoietic chimeras suggest that the presence of immune-type or at least
pH 2-sensitive interferon could be related to the presence of two allogenic
lymphocyte populations in each marmoset.

Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in the common marmoset, a
small-bodied Neotropical primate, is a well-known and validated animal model for 
multiple sclerosis (MS). This model can be used for exploratory research, i.e.,
investigating the pathogenic mechanisms involved in MS, and applied research,
testing the efficacy of new potential drugs.In this chapter, we will describe a
method to induce EAE in the marmoset. In addition, we will explain the most
common immunological techniques involved in the marmoset EAE research, namely
isolation of mononuclear cells (MNC) from peripheral blood and lymphoid tissue,
assaying T cell proliferation by thymidine incorporation, MNC phenotyping by flow
cytometry, antibody measurement by ELISA, generation of B cell lines and
antigen-specific T cell lines, and assaying cytotoxic T cells.

Vocalizations of common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) were examined under
experimental situations related to fear or anxiety. When marmosets were isolated 
in an unfamiliar environment, they frequently vocalized "tsik-egg" calls, which
were the combination calls of 'tsik' followed by several 'egg'. Tsik-egg calls
were also observed after treatment with the anxiogenic drug FG-7142 (20mg/kg,
sc). In contrast, when marmosets were exposed to predatory stimuli as
fear-evoking situations, they frequently vocalized tsik solo calls as well as
tsik-egg calls. These results suggest that marmosets dissociate the vocalization 
of tsik-egg and tsik calls under conditions related to fear/anxiety; tsik-egg
solo vocalizations were emitted under anxiety-related conditions (e.g., isolation
and anxiogenic drug treatment), whereas a mixed vocalization of tsik-egg and tsik
was emitted when confronted with fear-provoking stimuli (i.e., threatening
predatory stimuli). Tsik-egg call with/without tsik can be used as a specific
vocal index of fear/anxiety in marmosets, which allows us to understand the
neural mechanism of negative emotions in primate.

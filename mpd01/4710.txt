An outbreak of Bordetella bronchiseptica pneumonia in a colony of common
marmosets (Callithrix jacchus).

Baskerville M, Wood M, Baskerville A.

An outbreak of Bordetella bronchiseptica pneumonia occurred in a breeding colony 
of common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus). 16 animals, all except one under 12
months of age, died suddenly. Extensive lesions of pneumonia and pleurisy were
found at necropsy and B. bronchiseptica was isolated from the nasopharynx,
trachea and lungs. Older animals had only a mild rhinitis. Colonization of the
nasal mucosa occurred in 71 of 156 marmosets.

Craniofacial growth in young marmosets (Callithrix jacchus).

Goss AN, White J, Townsend GC.

A cross-sectional study of craniofacial growth in young marmosets was performed. 
Selected linear craniofacial measurements were obtained from groups of 5 animals 
of each sex at 3 monthly intervals from birth to 1 year. These data provide a
baseline for comparison with other colonies and in the assessment of teratogens
on craniofacial development.

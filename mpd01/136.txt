Paraoxonase (PON) plays roles in the metabolism of organophosphate xenobiotics
and drugs. Despite the importance of marmosets for research into drug metabolism 
and pharmacokinetics, marmoset paraoxonase has not yet been fully characterized. 
Consequently, we identified the PON1 gene in the marmoset genome by sequence
homology analysis. Marmoset PON1 cDNA containing an open reading frame (1065 bp) 
was successfully cloned from marmoset liver by reverse transcription-polymerase
chain reaction. The deduced amino acid sequence (355 amino acids) has
approximately 93% identity with the human ortholog and contains important amino
acid residues for substrate binding and calcium ion coordination. According to a 
phylogenetic tree of PON1 amino acid sequences constructed using data from seven 
animal species, marmoset PON1 is closer to human PON1 than it is to the PON1
orthologs of experimental animals such as pigs, rabbits, rats, and mice. Marmoset
PON1 mRNA was predominantly expressed in liver among the five tissues examined.
Marmoset PON1 protein secreted into plasma was detected by immunoblotting. The
paraoxon-hydrolyzing activity in plasma was higher in marmosets than in humans.
Based on these data, we concluded that marmoset and human PON1 have similar
characteristics with regard to genomic structure, amino acid sequences, and
tissue distribution.

Gastrointestinal disease is a frequently encountered problem among captive common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) colonies. Management can be challenging due to the 
number of etiologies responsible for gastrointestinal disease in this species,
limitations on diagnostic capabilities, and lack of effective treatments.
Understanding commonly described GI diseases in the captive marmoset can provide 
insight on the impact these diseases have on research studies and aid in the
development of appropriate management strategies. A review of commonly
encountered GI disease processes as well as routinely implicated causes of GI
disease in the common marmoset are provided. Current strategies in clinical
management of GI disease in the common marmoset, including approaches to colony
health, diagnostic testing, and commonly employed treatments are discussed.

The life history of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) points to this
species as a premiere nonhuman primate aging model. In order to take advantage of
these features, we require an expanded and refined understanding of aging in this
species. The papers in this special issue move this field forward substantially
by providing exciting new findings about the aging of the common marmoset and the
potential this species offers for revealing aging's secrets and improving the
lives of aging humans.

Understanding the connectivity architecture of entire vertebrate brains is a
fundamental but difficult task. Here we present an integrated neuro-histological 
pipeline as well as a grid-based tracer injection strategy for systematic
mesoscale connectivity mapping in the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).
Individual brains are sectioned into ~1700 20 µm sections using the tape transfer
technique, permitting high quality 3D reconstruction of a series of histochemical
stains (Nissl, myelin) interleaved with tracer labeled sections. Systematic
in-vivo MRI of the individual animals facilitates injection placement into
reference-atlas defined anatomical compartments. Further, by combining the
resulting 3D volumes, containing informative cytoarchitectonic markers, with
in-vivo and ex-vivo MRI, and using an integrated computational pipeline, we are
able to accurately map individual brains into a common reference atlas despite
the significant individual variation. This approach will facilitate the
systematic assembly of a mesoscale connectivity matrix together with
unprecedented 3D reconstructions of brain-wide projection patterns in a primate
brain.

In combination with advances in analytical methods, resting-state fMRI is
allowing unprecedented access to a better understanding of the network
organization of the brain. Increasing evidence suggests that this architecture
may incorporate highly functionally connected nodes, or "hubs", and we have
recently proposed local functional connectivity density (lFCD) mapping to
identify highly-connected nodes in the human brain. Here, we imaged awake
nonhuman primates to test whether, like the human brain, the marmoset brain
contains FC hubs. Ten adult common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) were acclimated
to mild, comfortable restraint using individualized helmets. Following restraint 
training, resting BOLD data were acquired during eight consecutive 10 min scans
for each subject. lFCD revealed prominent cortical and subcortical hubs of
connectivity across the marmoset brain; specifically, in primary and secondary
visual cortices (V1/V2), higher-order visual association areas (A19M/V6[DM]),
posterior parietal and posterior cingulate areas (PGM and A23b/A31), thalamus,
dorsal and ventral striatal areas (caudate, putamen, lateral septal nucleus, and 
anterior cingulate cortex (A24a). lFCD hubs were highly connected to widespread
areas of the brain, and further revealed significant network-network
interactions. These data provide a baseline platform for future investigations in
a nonhuman primate model of the brain's network topology.

Antagonism of the dopamine D3 receptor is considered a promising strategy for the
treatment of cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia. We have
previously reported that the atypical antipsychotic blonanserin, a dopamine D2/D3
and serotonin 5-HT2A receptor antagonist, highly occupies dopamine D3 receptors
at its antipsychotic dose range in rats. In the present study, we evaluated the
effects of blonanserin on executive function in common marmosets using the object
retrieval with detour (ORD) task. The dopamine D3 receptor-preferring agonist
(+)-PD-128907 at 1mg/kg decreased success rate in the difficult trial, but not in
the easy trial. Since the difference between the two trials is only cognitive
demand, our findings indicate that excess activation of dopamine D3 receptors
impairs executive function in common marmosets. Blonanserin at 0.1mg/kg reversed 
the decrease in success rate induced by (+)-PD-128907 in the difficult trial.
This finding indicates that blonanserin has beneficial effect on executive
function deficit induced by activation of the dopamine D3 receptor in common
marmosets. Next, and based on the glutamatergic hypothesis of schizophrenia, the 
common marmosets were treated with the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor
antagonist ketamine. Ketamine at sub-anesthetic doses decreased success rate in
the difficult trial, but not in the easy trial. Blonanserin at 0.1mg/kg reversed 
the decrease in success rate induced by ketamine in the difficult trial. The
findings of this study suggest that blonanserin might have beneficial effect on
executive dysfunction in patients with schizophrenia.

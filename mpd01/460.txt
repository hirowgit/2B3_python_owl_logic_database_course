BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating and inflammatory disease
of the central nervous system. Its diagnosis is clinical, often confirmed by
magnetic resonance imaging. This image modality, however, is not ideal for
discrimination of demyelination in grey and white matter regions from
inflammatory lesions. Positron Emission Tomography (PET), using specific
radiopharmaceuticals, can be a tool to differentiate between these processes. The
radiopharmaceutical [11C]PIB is widely used for detection of β-amyloid plaques,
but has also been suggested for the analysis of myelin content due to its
consistent uptake in white matter. The aim of this study was to evaluate [11C]PIB
PET imaging as a tool for detecting demyelinated regions in white and grey matter
of non-human primate model of progressive MS.
METHODS: Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) was induced in marmosets
by injection of recombinant human myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (rhMOG)
emulsified in either Incomplete Freund's Adjuvant (IFA) or Complete Freund's
Adjuvant (CFA). [11C]PIB PET images were acquired prior to immunization
(baseline) and after symptoms were present (end of experiment). Brain tissue was 
isolated for histochemical analysis.
RESULTS: All rhMOG/IFA-treated and rhMOG/CFA-treated animals showed clinical
signs of EAE. The rhMOG/CFA group presented a significant [11C]PIB uptake
reduction only in the left motor cortex (9%, P = 0.011). For the rhMOG/IFA group,
significant decrease in [11C]PIB uptake was observed in the whole brain (15%,
P = 0.015), in the right hemisphere of body of corpus callosum (34%, P = 0.02),
splenium of corpus callosum (38%, P = 0.004), hippocampus (19%, P = 0.036), optic
tract (13%, P = 0.025), thalamus (14%, P = 0.041), Globus pallidus (23%,
P = 0.017), head of caudate nucleus (25%, P = 0.045), tail of caudate nucleus
(29%, P = 0.003), putamen (28%, P = 0.047) and left hemisphere of body of corpus 
callosum (14%, P = 0.037) and head of caudate nucleus (23%, P = 0.023). [11C]PIB 
uptake significantly correlated with luxol fast blue histology (myelin marker),
both in the rhMOG/IFA (r2= 0.32, P < 0.0001) and the rhMOG/CFA group (r2= 0.46, P
< 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: [11C]PIB PET imaging is an efficient tool for detecting demyelination
in grey and white matter, in a non-human primate model of progressive MS.

Selective blockade of serotonin 2A (5-HT2A) receptors is a promising strategy to 
reduce L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA)-induced dyskinesia and has shown
efficacy in a Phase III clinical trial for dopaminergic psychosis in Parkinson's 
disease (PD). However, pre-clinical and clinical evidence suggest that, while
this approach may be effective and well tolerated, there might be a ceiling
beyond which no further therapeutic benefit might be achieved. There is mounting 
evidence that 5-HT2A receptors form a functional hetero-complex with metabotropic
glutamate 2 (mGlu2) receptors, with antagonism of 5-HT2A receptors and activation
of mGlu2 receptors producing similar effects on the Gi/Gq signalling ratio at the
intra-cellular level. Based on this interaction between 5-HT2A and mGlu2
receptors, we hypothesised that activation of mGlu2 receptors would alleviate
dyskinesia and psychosis in PD. LY-354,740 is a selective mGlu2/3 orthosteric
agonist that was previously tested in the clinic. In experiments conducted in the
6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-lesioned rat and the
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-lesioned marmoset, we found
that mGlu2/3 activation with LY-354,740 significantly reduced the expression of
dyskinesia and psychosis-like behaviours, while simultaneously enhancing l-DOPA
therapeutic benefit. Moreover, mGlu2/3 activation with LY-354,740 attenuated the 
development of dyskinesia. These data indicate that activation of mGlu2/3
receptors is a therapeutic strategy that may provide relief for both motor
and-non-motor treatment-related complications in PD.

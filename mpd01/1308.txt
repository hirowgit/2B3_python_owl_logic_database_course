Induced pluripotent stem cells from nonhuman primates (NHPs) have unique roles in
cell biology and regenerative medicine. Because of the relatedness of NHPs to
humans, NHP iPS cells can serve as a source of differentiated derivatives that
can be used to address important questions in the comparative biology of
primates. Additionally, when used as a source of cells for regenerative medicine,
NHP iPS cells serve an invaluable role in translational experiments in cell
therapy. Reprogramming of NHP somatic cells requires the same conditions as
previously established for human cells. However, throughout the process, a
variety of modifications to the human cell protocols must be made to accommodate 
significant species differences.

Protocol for metagenomic virus detection in clinical specimens.

Sixty percent of emerging viruses have a zoonotic origin, making transmission
from animals a major threat to public health. Prompt identification and analysis 
of these pathogens are indispensable to taking action toward prevention and
protection of the affected population. We quantifiably compared classical and
modern approaches of virus purification and enrichment in theory and experiments.
Eventually, we established an unbiased protocol for detection of known and novel 
emerging viruses from organ tissues (tissue-based universal virus detection for
viral metagenomics [TUViD-VM]). The final TUViD-VM protocol was extensively
validated by using real-time PCR and next-generation sequencing. We could
increase the amount of detectable virus nucleic acids and improved the detection 
of viruses <75,000-fold compared with other tested approaches. This TUViD-VM
protocol can be used in metagenomic and virome studies to increase the likelihood
of detecting viruses from any biological source.

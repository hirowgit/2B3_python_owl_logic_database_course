The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a useful experimental animal to
evaluate the pharmacokinetics of drug candidates. Cytochrome P450 (P450) 2B
enzyme in marmoset livers has been identified; however, only limited information 
on the enzymatic properties and distribution has been available. Marmoset P450
2B6 amino acids showed high sequence identities (>86%) with those of primates
including humans and cynomolgus monkeys. Phylogenetic analysis using amino acid
sequences indicated that marmoset P450 2B6 was closer to human and cynomolgus
monkey P450 2B6 than to P450 2B orthologs of other species, including pigs, dogs,
rabbits and rodents. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis using
specific primers showed P450 2B6 mRNA predominantly expressed in livers among the
five marmoset tissues, similar to those of humans and cynomolgus monkeys.
Marmoset P450 2B6 heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli membranes oxidized
7-ethoxycoumarin, pentoxyresorufin, propofol and testosterone, at roughly similar
rates to those of humans and/or cynomolgus monkeys. A high capacity of marmoset
P450 2B6 with propofol 4-hydroxylation (at low ionic strength conditions) with a 
low Km value was relatively comparable to that for marmoset livers. These results
collectively indicated a high propofol 4-hydroxylation activity of P450 2B6
expressed in marmoset livers.

The common marmoset (CM; Callithrix jacchus) is a small New World monkey with a
high rate of pregnancy and is maintained in closed colonies as an experimental
animal species. Although CMs are used for immunological research, such as studies
of autoimmune disease and infectious disease, their immunological characteristics
are less defined than those of other nonhuman primates. We and others have
analyzed antigen recognition-related molecules, the development of hematopoietic 
stem cells (HSCs), and the molecules involved in the immune response. CMs
systemically express Caja-G, a major histocompatibility complex class I molecule,
and the ortholog of HLA-G, a suppressive nonclassical HLA class I molecule. HSCs 
express CD117, while CD34 is not essential for multipotency. CD117+ cells
developed into all hematopoietic cell lineages, but compared with human HSCs, B
cells did not extensively develop when HSCs were transplanted into an
immunodeficient mouse. Although autoimmune models have been successfully
established, sensitization of CMs with some bacteria induced a low protective
immunity. In CMs, B cells were observed in the periphery, but IgG levels were
very low compared with those in humans and mice. This evidence suggests that CM
immunity is partially suppressed systemically. Such immune regulation might
benefit pregnancy in CMs, which normally deliver dizygotic twins, the placentae
of which are fused and the immune cells of which are mixed. In this review, we
describe the CM immune system and discuss the possibility of using CMs as a model
of human immunity.

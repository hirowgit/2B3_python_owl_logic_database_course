Marmoset monkeys show high levels of proactive prosociality, a trait shared with 
humans, presumably because both species rely on allomaternal care. However, it is
not clear whether the proximate regulation of this convergent trait is also
similar, in particular with regard to intentionality, which is a defining
characteristic of prosocial behavior in the human literature. The aim of this
paper was to investigate whether marmoset monkeys' prosociality fulfils the
criteria of intentionality developed in primate communication research. The
results show that marmoset prosocial behavior (i) has some degree of flexibility,
since individuals can use multiple means to reach their goal and adjust them to
specific conditions, (ii) depends on the presence of an audience, i.e. potential 
recipients (social use), and (iii) is goal-directed, because (a) it continues
exactly until the putative goal is reached, and (b) individuals check back and
look at/for their partner when their prosocial actions do not achieve the
putative goal (i.e. if their actions don't lead to the expected outcome, this
elicits distinct reactions in the actor). These results suggest that marmoset
prosociality is under some degree of voluntary, intentional control. They are in 
line with other findings that marmosets perceive each other as intentional
agents, and only learn socially from actions that are perceived as intentional.
The most parsimonious conclusion is, therefore, that prosocial behavior is
fundamentally under voluntary control in marmosets, just as it is in humans, even
though our more sophisticated cognitive abilities allow for a far more complex
integration of prosociality into a broader variety of contexts and of behavioral 
goals.

BACKGROUND: Human chromosome 19 has many unique characteristics including gene
density more than double the genome-wide average and 20 large tandemly clustered 
gene families. It also has the highest GC content of any chromosome, especially
outside gene clusters. The high GC content and concomitant high content of
hypermutable CpG sites raises the possibility chromosome 19 exhibits higher
levels of nucleotide diversity both within and between species, and may possess
greater variation in DNA methylation that regulates gene expression.
RESULTS: We examined GC and CpG content of chromosome 19 orthologs across
representatives of the primate order. In all 12 primate species with suitable
genome assemblies, chromosome 19 orthologs have the highest GC content of any
chromosome. CpG dinucleotides and CpG islands are also more prevalent in
chromosome 19 orthologs than other chromosomes. GC and CpG content are generally 
higher outside the gene clusters. Intra-species variation based on SNPs in human 
common dbSNP, rhesus, crab eating macaque, baboon and marmoset datasets is most
prevalent on chromosome 19 and its orthologs. Inter-species comparisons based on 
phyloP conservation show accelerated nucleotide evolution for chromosome 19
promoter flanking and enhancer regions. These same regulatory regions show the
highest CpG density of any chromosome suggesting they possess considerable
methylome regulatory potential.
CONCLUSIONS: The pattern of high GC and CpG content in chromosome 19 orthologs,
particularly outside gene clusters, is present from human to mouse lemur
representing 74 million years of primate evolution. Much CpG variation exists
both within and between primate species with a portion of this variation
occurring in regulatory regions.

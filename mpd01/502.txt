Two strictly anaerobic strains (MB11T and MB56) were isolated from common
marmoset (Callithrixjacchus) faeces. Cells of the two strains were
Gram-stain-negative, pleomorphic short (strain MB11T) or long (strain MB56) rods.
Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that both
isolates were related to the genus Phascolarctobacterium. They had 16S rRNA gene 
sequences similarities lower than 93 % to previously described species,
Phascolarctobacterium faecium ACM 3679T and Phascolarctobacterium succinatutens
YIT 12067T, and 98.7 % between themselves. DNA-DNA hybridization values showed
that strains MB11T and MB56 were the same species. The genomic DNA G+C content of
strains MB11T and MB56 were 47.3-47.4 mol% and 47.7-48.0 mol%. The isolates had
different enzymatic activities compared with P. succinatutens JCM 16074T and
different major cellular fatty acids compared with P. faecium ACM 3679T.
Substrate availability revealed that they utilized not only succinate, but also
pyruvate. With pyruvate supplementation, they produced both propionate and
acetate, while only propionate production occured with succinate. As suggested by
the phylogenic and physiological properties of strains MB11T and MB56, we propose
the name Phascolarctobacteriumwakonense sp. nov. with the type strain MB11T (=JCM
32899T=DSM 107697T).

Networks of widely distributed regions populate human association cortex. One
network, often called the default network, is positioned at the apex of a
gradient of sequential networks that radiate outward from primary cortex. Here,
extensive anatomical data made available through the Marmoset Brain Architecture 
Project are explored to show a homologue exists in marmoset. Results reveal that 
a gradient of networks extend outward from primary cortex to progressively
higher-order transmodal association cortex in both frontal and temporal cortex.
The apex transmodal network comprises frontopolar and rostral temporal
association cortex, parahippocampal areas TH / TF, the ventral posterior midline,
and lateral parietal association cortex. The positioning of this network in the
gradient and its composition of areas make it a candidate homologue to the human 
default network. That the marmoset, a physiologically- and genetically-accessible
primate, might possess a default-network-like candidate creates opportunities for
study of higher cognitive and social functions.

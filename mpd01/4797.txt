Marmoset response to immunization with porcine zonae pellucidae. Measurement of
antibody activity with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

Fox LL, Gengozian N, Shivers CA, Sieg P.

An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect antibodies in
sera from a marmoset inoculated with porcine zonae. Antibodies which bound to
heat solubilized zonae immobilized in microtiter plates were detected by an
enzymatic reaction using goat antimarmoset IgG conjugated to alkaline
phosphatase. During a nine-week immunization period, the antibody response
profile as determined with the ELISA was parallel to that obtained with an
indirect immunofluorescent test on intact zonae. This procedure has certain
advantages over presently used methods of titrating anti-zona sera.

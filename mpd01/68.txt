The primary motor cortex (M1) is essential for voluntary fine-motor control and
is functionally conserved across mammals1. Here, using high-throughput
transcriptomic and epigenomic profiling of more than 450,000 single nuclei in
humans, marmoset monkeys and mice, we demonstrate a broadly conserved cellular
makeup of this region, with similarities that mirror evolutionary distance and
are consistent between the transcriptome and epigenome. The core conserved
molecular identities of neuronal and non-neuronal cell types allow us to generate
a cross-species consensus classification of cell types, and to infer conserved
properties of cell types across species. Despite the overall conservation,
however, many species-dependent specializations are apparent, including
differences in cell-type proportions, gene expression, DNA methylation and
chromatin state. Few cell-type marker genes are conserved across species,
revealing a short list of candidate genes and regulatory mechanisms that are
responsible for conserved features of homologous cell types, such as the
GABAergic chandelier cells. This consensus transcriptomic classification allows
us to use patch-seq (a combination of whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, RNA
sequencing and morphological characterization) to identify corticospinal Betz
cells from layer 5 in non-human primates and humans, and to characterize their
highly specialized physiology and anatomy. These findings highlight the robust
molecular underpinnings of cell-type diversity in M1 across mammals, and point to
the genes and regulatory pathways responsible for the functional identity of cell
types and their species-specific adaptations.

Understanding masseter muscle (MM) innervation is critical for the study of
cell-specific mechanisms of pain induced by temporomandibular disorder (TMDs) or 
after facial surgery. Here, we identified trigeminal (TG) sensory neuronal
subtypes (MM TG neurons) innervating MM fibers, masseteric fascia, tendons, and
adjusted tissues. A combination of patch clamp electrophysiology and
immunohistochemistry (IHC) on TG neurons back-traced from reporter mouse MM found
nine distinct subtypes of MM TG neurons. Of these neurons, 24% belonged to
non-peptidergic IB-4+/TRPA1- or IB-4+/TRPA1+ groups, while two TRPV1+ small-sized
neuronal groups were classified as peptidergic/CGRP+ One small-sized CGRP+
neuronal group had a unique electrophysiological profile and were recorded from
Nav1.8- or trkC+ neurons. The remaining CGRP+ neurons were medium-sized, could be
divided into Nav1.8-/trkC- and Nav1.8low/trkC+ clusters, and showed large
5HT-induced current. The final two MM TG neuronal groups were trkC+ and had no
Nav1.8 and CGRP. Among MM TG neurons, TRPV1+/CGRP- (somatostatin+), tyrosine
hydroxylase (TH)+ (C-LTMR), TRPM8+, MrgprA3+, or trkB+ (Aδ-LTMR) subtypes have
not been detected. Masseteric muscle fibers, tendons and masseteric fascia in
mice and the common marmoset, a new world monkey, were exclusively innervated by 
either CGRP+/NFH+ or CGRP-/NFH+ medium-to-large neurons, which we found using a
Nav1.8-YFP reporter, and labeling with CGRP, TRPV1, neurofilament heavy chain
(NFH) and pgp9.5 antibodies. These nerves were mainly distributed in tendon and
at junctions of deep-middle-superficial parts of MM. Overall, the data presented 
here demonstrates that MM is innervated by a distinct subset of TG neurons, which
have unique characteristics and innervation patterns.

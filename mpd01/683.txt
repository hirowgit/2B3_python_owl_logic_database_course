Morphological characterisation of the genital organs of primates may bring
significant contributions to the understanding of different reproductive
behaviours and support new conservation strategies. However, relevant or detailed
descriptions of genital morphology of several primate species are still lacking. 
This study describes the gross and microscopic anatomy of the internal and
external genitalia of Marca's marmoset (Mico marcai). The same organs described
in other primate species were identified here, but some anatomical
particularities were detected, such as absence of a dartos tunic, presence of a
vas deferens ampulla, absence of spongious erectile tissue in the pelvic urethra,
separation of prostate gland lobes by a longitudinal sulcus and lack of septation
in the corpus cavernosus and spongiosus at the level of the shaft and free
portion of the penis. Keratinised type 1 spicules arising from epidermal or
dermal projections were found in the free portion of the penis. Microscopic
analysis revealed a small bone (baculum) consisting of peripheral compact bone
and a central, non-ossified area filled with vascular tissue at the distal end of
this portion of the penis. Results of this study may support further comparative 
studies of primates' reproductive ecology.

Quantifying cortisol concentration in hair is a non-invasive biomarker of
long-term hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) activation, and thus can provide
important information on laboratory animal health. Marmosets (Callithrix jacchus)
and capuchins (Cebus apella) are New World primates increasingly used in
biomedical and neuroscience research, yet published hair cortisol concentrations 
for these species are limited. Review of the existing published hair cortisol
values from marmosets reveals highly discrepant values and the use of variable
techniques for hair collection, processing, and cortisol extraction. In this
investigation we utilized a well-established, standardized protocol to extract
and quantify cortisol from marmoset (n = 12) and capuchin (n = 4) hair. Shaved
hair samples were collected from the upper thigh during scheduled exams and
analyzed via methanol extraction and enzyme immunoassay. In marmosets, hair
cortisol concentration ranged from 2,710 to 6,267 pg/mg and averaged
4,070 ± 304 pg/mg. In capuchins, hair cortisol concentration ranged from 621 to
2,089 pg/mg and averaged 1,092 ± 338 pg/mg. Hair cortisol concentration was
significantly different between marmosets and capuchins, with marmosets having
higher concentrations than capuchins. The incorporation of hair cortisol analysis
into research protocols provides a non-invasive measure of HPA axis activity over
time, which offers insight into animal health. Utilization of standard protocols 
across laboratories is essential to obtaining valid measurements and allowing for
valuable future cross-species comparisons.

Gastrointestinal disease is a frequently encountered problem among captive common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) colonies. Management can be challenging due to the 
number of etiologies responsible for gastrointestinal disease in this species,
limitations on diagnostic capabilities, and lack of effective treatments.
Understanding commonly described GI diseases in the captive marmoset can provide 
insight on the impact these diseases have on research studies and aid in the
development of appropriate management strategies. A review of commonly
encountered GI disease processes as well as routinely implicated causes of GI
disease in the common marmoset are provided. Current strategies in clinical
management of GI disease in the common marmoset, including approaches to colony
health, diagnostic testing, and commonly employed treatments are discussed.

Blunted reward responsivity is associated with anhedonia in humans and is a core 
feature of depression. This protocol describes how to train the common marmoset, 
Callithrix jacchus, on an appetitive Pavlovian conditioning paradigm to measure
behavioral and cardiovascular correlates of anticipatory and consummatory phases 
of reward processing. We describe how to use intracerebral infusions to
manipulate brain regions whose activity is relevant to impaired reward processing
in depression and how the paradigm can be used to test antidepressant efficacy.
For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to
Alexander et al. (2019).

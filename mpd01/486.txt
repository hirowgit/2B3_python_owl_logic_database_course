The historical view of β-lactams as ineffective antimycobacterials has given way 
to growing interest in the activity of this class against Mycobacterium
tuberculosis (Mtb) in the presence of a β-lactamase inhibitor. However, most
antimycobacterial β-lactams kill Mtb only or best when the bacilli are
replicating. Here, a screen of 1904 β-lactams led to the identification of
cephalosporins substituted with a pyrithione moiety at C3' that are active
against Mtb under both replicating and nonreplicating conditions, neither
activity requiring a β-lactamase inhibitor. Studies showed that activity against 
nonreplicating Mtb required the in situ release of the pyrithione, independent of
the known class A β-lactamase, BlaC. In contrast, replicating Mtb could be killed
both by released pyrithione and by the parent β-lactam. Thus, the
antimycobacterial activity of pyrithione-containing cephalosporins arises from
two mechanisms that kill mycobacteria in different metabolic states.

A novel Bifidobacterium strain, MRM 9.3T, was isolated from a faecal sample of a 
baby common marmoset (Callithrixjacchus). Cells were Gram-stain-positive,
non-motile, non-sporulating, non-haemolytic, facultatively anaerobic and fructose
6-phosphate phosphoketolase-positive. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA
genes as well as multilocus sequences (representing hsp60, rpoB, clpC, dnaJ and
dnaG genes) and the core genomes revealed that strain MRM 9.3T exhibited
phylogenetic relatedness to Bifidobacterium myosotis DSM 100196T. Comparative
analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences confirmed the phylogenetic results showing
the highest gene sequence identity with strain B.ifidobacterium myosotis DSM
100196T (95.6 %). The average nucleotide identity, amino acid average identity
and in silico DNA-DNA hybridization values between MRM 9.3T and DSM 100196T were 
79.9, 72.1 and 28.5 %, respectively. Phenotypic and genotypic features clearly
showed that the strain MRM 9.3T represents a novel species, for which the name
Bifidobacterium jacchi sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is MRM 9.3T (=DSM
103362T =JCM 31788T).

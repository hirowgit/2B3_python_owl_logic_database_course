Induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells hold great promise for regenerative medicine
and the treatment of various diseases. Before proceeding to clinical trials, it
is important to test the efficacy and safety of iPS cell-based treatments using
experimental animals. The common marmoset is a new world monkey widely used in
biomedical studies. However, efficient methods that could generate iPS cells from
a variety of cells have not been established. Here, we report that marmoset cells
are efficiently reprogrammed into iPS cells by combining RNA transfection and
chemical compounds. Using this novel combination, we generate transgene
integration-free marmoset iPS cells from a variety of cells that are difficult to
reprogram using conventional RNA transfection method. Furthermore, we show this
is similarly effective for human and cynomolgus monkey iPS cell generation. Thus,
the addition of chemical compounds during RNA transfection greatly facilitates
reprogramming and efficient generation of completely integration-free safe iPS
cells in primates, particularly from difficult-to-reprogram cells.

Whole metagenome shotgun (WMGS) sequencing is a method that provides insights
into the genomic composition and arrangement of complex microbial consortia.
Here, we report how WMGS coupled with a cultivation approach allows the isolation
of novel bifidobacteria from animal fecal samples. A combination of in silico
analyses based on nucleotide and protein sequences facilitate the identification 
of genetic material belonging to putative novel species. Consequently, the
prediction of metabolic properties by in silico analyses permits the
identification of specific substrates that are then employed to isolate these
species through a cultivation method.

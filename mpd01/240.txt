During primate arboreal locomotion, substrate orientation modifies body axis
orientation and biomechanical contribution of fore- and hindlimbs. To
characterize the role of cortical oscillations in integrating these locomotor
demands, we recorded electrocorticographic activity from left dorsal premotor,
primary motor, and supplementary motor cortices of three common marmosets moving 
across a branch-like small-diameter pole, fixed horizontally or vertically.
Animals displayed behavioral adjustments to the task, namely, the horizontal
condition mainly induced quadrupedal walk with pronated/neutral forelimb
postures, whereas the vertical condition induced walk and bound gaits with
supinated/neutral postures. Examination of cortical activity suggests that β
(16-35 Hz) and γ (75-100 Hz) oscillations could reflect different processes in
locomotor adjustments. During task, modulation of γ ERS by substrate orientation 
(horizontal/vertical) and epoch (preparation/execution) suggests close tuning to 
movement dynamics and biomechanical demands. β ERD was essentially modulated by
gait (walk/bound), which could illustrate contribution to movement sequence and
coordination. At rest, modulation of β power by substrate orientation underlines 
its role in sensorimotor processes for postural maintenance.

The domestication syndrome refers to a set of traits that are the by-products of 
artificial selection for increased tolerance toward humans [1-3]. One hypothesis 
is that some species, like humans and bonobos, "self-domesticated" and have been 
under selection for that same suite of domesticated phenotypes [4-8]. However,
the evidence for this has been largely circumstantial. Here, we provide evidence 
that, in marmoset monkeys, the size of a domestication phenotype-a white facial
fur patch-is linked to their degree of affiliative vocal responding. During
development, the amount of parental vocal feedback experienced influences the
rate of growth of this facial white patch, and this suggests a mechanistic link
between the two phenotypes, possibly via neural crest cells. Our study provides
evidence for links between vocal behavior and the development of morphological
phenotypes associated with domestication in a nonhuman primate.

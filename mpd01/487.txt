A novel Bifidobacterium strain, MRM 9.3T, was isolated from a faecal sample of a 
baby common marmoset (Callithrixjacchus). Cells were Gram-stain-positive,
non-motile, non-sporulating, non-haemolytic, facultatively anaerobic and fructose
6-phosphate phosphoketolase-positive. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA
genes as well as multilocus sequences (representing hsp60, rpoB, clpC, dnaJ and
dnaG genes) and the core genomes revealed that strain MRM 9.3T exhibited
phylogenetic relatedness to Bifidobacterium myosotis DSM 100196T. Comparative
analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences confirmed the phylogenetic results showing
the highest gene sequence identity with strain B.ifidobacterium myosotis DSM
100196T (95.6 %). The average nucleotide identity, amino acid average identity
and in silico DNA-DNA hybridization values between MRM 9.3T and DSM 100196T were 
79.9, 72.1 and 28.5 %, respectively. Phenotypic and genotypic features clearly
showed that the strain MRM 9.3T represents a novel species, for which the name
Bifidobacterium jacchi sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is MRM 9.3T (=DSM
103362T =JCM 31788T).

The common marmoset (marmoset; Callithrix jacchus) shows anatomical and
physiological features that are in common with humans. Establishing induced
pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from marmosets holds promise for enhancing the
utility of the animal model for biomedical and preclinical studies. However, in
spite of the presence of some previous reports on marmoset iPSCs, the
reprogramming technology in marmosets is still under development. In particular, 
the efficacy of RNA-based reprogramming has not been thoroughly investigated. In 
this study, we attempted RNA-based reprogramming for deriving iPSCs from marmoset
fibroblasts. Although we failed to derive iPSC colonies from marmoset fibroblasts
by using a conventional RNA-based reprogramming method previously validated in
human fibroblasts, we succeeded in deriving colony-forming cells with a modified 
induction medium supplemented with a novel set of small molecules. Importantly,
following one-week culture of the colony-forming cells in conventional embryonic 
stem cell (ESC) medium, we obtained iPSCs which express endogenous pluripotent
markers and show a differentiation potential into all three germ layers. Taken
together, our results indicate that RNA-based reprogramming, which is valuable
for deriving transgene-free iPSCs, is applicable to marmosets.

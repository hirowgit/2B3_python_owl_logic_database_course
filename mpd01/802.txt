Here, we report the existence of meningeal lymphatic vessels in human and
nonhuman primates (common marmoset monkeys) and the feasibility of noninvasively 
imaging and mapping them in vivo with high-resolution, clinical MRI. On T2-FLAIR 
and T1-weighted black-blood imaging, lymphatic vessels enhance with gadobutrol, a
gadolinium-based contrast agent with high propensity to extravasate across a
permeable capillary endothelial barrier, but not with gadofosveset, a blood-pool 
contrast agent. The topography of these vessels, running alongside dural venous
sinuses, recapitulates the meningeal lymphatic system of rodents. In primates,
meningeal lymphatics display a typical panel of lymphatic endothelial markers by 
immunohistochemistry. This discovery holds promise for better understanding the
normal physiology of lymphatic drainage from the central nervous system and
potential aberrations in neurological diseases.

Optogenetics has potential applications in the study of epilepsy and
neuroprostheses, and for studies on neural circuit dynamics. However, to achieve 
translation to clinical usage, optogenetic interfaces that are capable of chronic
stimulation and monitoring with minimal brain trauma are required. We aimed to
develop a chronically implantable device for photostimulation of the brain of
non-human primates. We used a micro-light-emitting diode (LED) array with a
flexible polyimide film. The array was combined with a whole-cortex
electrocorticographic (ECoG) electrode array for simultaneous photostimulation
and recording. Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) was virally transduced into the cerebral
cortex of common marmosets, and then the device was epidurally implanted into
their brains. We recorded the neural activity during photostimulation of the
awake monkeys for 4 months. The neural responses gradually increased after the
virus injection for ~8 weeks and remained constant for another 8 weeks. The
micro-LED and ECoG arrays allowed semi-invasive simultaneous stimulation and
recording during long-term implantation in the brains of non-human primates. The 
development of this device represents substantial progress in the field of
optogenetic applications.

Maternal hormones can dramatically modify offspring phenotypes via organizational
actions on morphological and behavioral development. In placental mammals, there 
is the possibility that some portion of hormones in maternal circulation may be
derived from fetal origin. We tested the possibility that maternal androgens in
pregnant female marmosets reflected, in part, contributions from male fetuses by 
comparing levels of urinary androgens across pregnancy in females carrying
varying numbers of male offspring. We monitored urinary androgen excretion in 18 
pregnancies from five female white-faced marmosets (Callithrix geoffroyi).
Androgen levels rose significantly in the first trimester of pregnancy, reached a
peak in the middle of the second trimester, and then declined gradually until
parturition. At no point in pregnancy were levels of urinary androgens higher in 
females carrying litters that had 50% or more males than in females carrying
litters that were less than 50% male. Levels of maternal androgens were not
associated with litter size, the number of males in the litter, or with the
proportion of the litter that was male. The high levels of androgen in pregnant
females are therefore likely of strictly maternal origin, and any modification of
fetal growth and development can be considered a 'maternal effect'.

The effect of nest box availability on the circadian activity rhythm (CAR) was
compared in a diurnal primate kept in two conditions: with and without nest box, 
in a light-dark (LD) cycle (12:12) and constant light (LL). Marmosets kept in LD 
without nest box showed a longer duration of the activity phase (alpha), smaller 
day-to-day variability in activity onset and offset and higher levels of
activity, particularly towards the end of the activity time. In LL, all animals
maintained with nest box expressed free-running CAR, but without nest box, 3 of
the 4 individuals showed relative coordination with the outdoor LD cycle,
possibly due to social synchronization with captive marmosets maintained
outdoors. All animals showed longer alpha and higher levels of activity without
nest box. Thus, the availability of a nest box is an important aspect in
maintaining marmosets, influencing CAR expression in this diurnal primate in LD
and LL conditions, possibly due to differences in light exposure that induces
masking. Further studies are needed to evaluate the effects of the unavailability
of a nest box on CAR in LL conditions.

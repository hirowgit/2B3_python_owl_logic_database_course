Junin virus infection of Calithrix jacchus: haematological findings.

Frigerio MJ, Rondinone SN, Callelo MA, Paradisi ER, Weissenbacher MC.

Haematological changes produced by experimental Junin virus infection of a
platyrrhine monkey, Callithrix jacchus were studied. Normocytic and normochromic 
anaemia appeared after 7 days post infection (p. i.), and increased steadily
until day 21 p. i. Reticulocytes and circulating erythroblasts were elevated
during the anaemia, reached a peak on day 7 p. i., and disappeared later.
Platelets and leukocytes showed a significant decrease from days 14 and 18 p. i.,
respectively. These alterations could be attributed to the damage of bone marrow 
and lymphatic tissue.

Improved morphological techniques for screening potentially ototoxic compounds in
laboratory animals.

Astbury PJ, Read NG.

A technique is described for morphological examination of the organ of Corti
which can be used in routine toxicological studies. This involves the dissection 
of a critical point-dried cochlea and examination of a surface preparation of the
entire organ by scanning electron microscopy. The procedure is simple and far
less time consuming than that previously used for light microscopy. Quantitative 
estimates of damage induced in the organ of Corti either by the administration of
ototoxic compounds or as a response to noise-induced or age-related changes can
be obtained. Details are given for the application of this technique to two
species commonly used in toxicity studies. With minor modifications it could be
applied to many other species of animal.

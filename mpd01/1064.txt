Ion homeostasis in the inner ear is essential for proper hearing. Anion
exchangers are one of the transporters responsible for the maintenance of
homeostasis, but their expression profile in the primate cochlea has not been
fully characterized. However, species-specific overlapping expression patterns
and functional compensation in other organs, such as the kidney, pancreas and
small intestine, have been reported. Here, we determined the expression patterns 
of the anion exchangers SLC26A4, SLC26A5, SLC26A6, SLC26A7, SLC26A11, SLC4A2 and 
SLC4A3 in the cochlea of a non-human primate, the common marmoset (Callithrix
jacchus). Although the pattern of expression of SLC26A4 and SLC26A5 was similar
to that in rodents, SLC26A7, SLC4A2, SLC4A3 exhibited different distributions.
Notably, five transporters, SLC26A4, SLC26A6, SLC26A11 SLC4A2 and SLC4A3, were
expressed in the cells of the outer sulcus. Our results reveal a species-specific
distribution pattern of anion exchangers in the cochlea, particularly in the
outer sulcus cells, suggesting functional compensation among these exchangers.
This "primate-specific" pattern may be related to the human-specific hearing loss
phenotypes of channelopathy disorders, including the SLC26A4-related diseases
Pendred syndrome/DFNB4.

BACKGROUND: Basal thermal values of captive adult black tufted-ear marmosets
(Callithrix penicillata) in a thermoneutral environment were measured via
different methods, along with body weight and hematological parameters.
METHOD: Body temperatures were recorded with rectal (RC), subcutaneous (SC)
microchip transponder and infrared (left and right) tympanic membrane (TM)
thermometries. Thermal values were correlated with body mass and some
hematological data.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Similar RC and SC temperatures were observed, these
being significantly higher than the left and right TM values. SC temperature was 
positively correlated and in close agreement with RC measurements. Although body 
temperatures were not influenced by gender, capture time, or body weight, they
were correlated with hematological parameters. Thus, body temperatures in this
species seem to reflect some of the characteristics of the assessments' location,
with SC microchip transponders being a less invasive method to assess body
temperature in these small-bodied non-human primates.

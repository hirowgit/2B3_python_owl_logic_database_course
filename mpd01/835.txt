Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder
producing a variety of motor and cognitive deficits with the causes remaining
largely unknown. The gradual loss of the nigrostriatal pathway is currently
considered the pivotal pathological event. To better understand the progression
of PD and improve treatment management, defining the disease on a structural
basis and expanding brain analysis to extra-nigral structures is indispensable.
The anatomical complexity and the presence of neuromelanin, make the use of
non-human primates an essential element in developing putative imaging biomarkers
of PD. To this end, ex vivo T2-weighted magnetic resonance images were acquired
from control and 1-methyl-4 phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated
marmosets. Volume measurements of the caudate, putamen, and substantia nigra
indicated significant atrophy and cortical thinning. Tensor-based morphometry
provided a more extensive and hypothesis free assessment of widespread changes
caused by the toxin insult to the brain, especially highlighting regional
cortical atrophy. The results highlight the importance of developing imaging
biomarkers of PD in non-human primate models considering their distinct
neuroanatomy. It is essential to further develop these biomarkers in vivo to
provide non-invasive tools to detect pre-symptomatic PD and to monitor potential 
disease altering therapeutics.

There has been, and continues to be, a dramatic shift in the human population
towards older ages necessitating biomedical research aimed at better
understanding the basic biology of aging and age-related diseases and
facilitating new and improved therapeutic options. As it is not practical to
perform the breadth of this research in humans, animal models are necessary to
recapitulate the complexity of the aging environment. The mouse model is most
frequently chosen for these endeavors, however, they are frequently not the most 
appropriate model. Non-human primates, on the other hand, are more closely
related to humans and recapitulate the human aging process and development of
age-related diseases. Extensive aging research has been performed in the
well-characterized rhesus macaque aging model. More recently, the common
marmoset, a small non-human primate with a shorter lifespan, has been explored as
a potential aging model. This model holds particular promise as an aging disease 
model in part due to the successful creation of transgenic marmosets. Limitations
to the use of non-human primates in aging research exist but can be mitigated
somewhat by the existence of available resources supported by the National
Institutes of Health. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Animal
models of aging - edited by "Houtkooper Riekelt".

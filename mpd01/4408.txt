A low molecular weight peptide has been partially purified from sheep follicular 
fluid. It inhibited FSH binding to granulosa cells from ovarian follicles of
common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus). When injected into cycling marmosets
during the follicular phase, it reduced the area under the curve (AUC) of
circulating progesterone. The peptide also shortened the luteal phase in all
marmosets during the treatment cycle compared to the pretreatment control cycle. 
These results indicate that the ovarian follicular fluid peptide inhibited FSH
binding to granulosa cells thereby probably resulting in decreased progesterone
secretion (AUC) from these cells and subsequently inducing luteal insufficiency.

A peptide purified from human ovarian follicular fluid (hOFFP) was administered
during the follicular phase of post-partum marmosets. Four of the five animals
treated with hOFFP, ovulated as evidenced by the presence of ovarian stigmata at 
the time of laparotomy. However, only 2 of these animals became pregnant, one had
a normal delivery while the other aborted. A shortening of the luteal phase was
observed in the other three animals and all animals conceived in subsequent
cycles. The results indicated that treatment with the ovarian follicular fluid
peptide resulted in impairment of fertility as a result of luteal insufficiency.

BACKGROUND: Objective gait evaluation in humans is used as a predictive
disability outcome measure as well as an indicator for intervention
effectiveness. Parallel methods of gait analysis in nonhuman primate models are
essential for clinical translation. The goal of this study was to first assess
whether marmosets' gait data could be reliably collected in a Noldus CatWalk
XT10.6 and second, establish a testing protocol to assess gait and the
intraindividual variability during repeated testing.
NEW METHOD: The CatWalk, originally developed for rodents, was modified and used 
to assess gait in eight adult common marmoset monkeys across multiple days and
trials. Data was first analyzed to identify valid runs. Repeated measures ANOVA
was completed for the following gait measures: mean base of support, average
stride length, average swing time, and average stance time.
RESULTS: Raters had a high level of concurrence of usable data across all trials 
with successful trials including four consecutive hindfoot footfalls, during a
continuous, uninterrupted segment of walking. A significant main effect of time
(p < 0.000) but not rater (p = 0.98) was present with significant interactions
for time by subject (p < 0.000), but not rater per subject (p = 0.538), time
(p = 0.186), or three-way interaction (p = 0.297).
COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHOD(S): Gait has been assessed using force-plate and 
video data. The CatWalk allowed reproducible, automated and translational
locomotor data to be collected at multiple time points with detailed analyses
that identified a diagonal gait pattern.
CONCLUSIONS: The CatWalk system, similar to those used in humans, can be
effectively used to quantify spatiotemporal characteristics of gait in the common
marmoset.

BACKGROUND: The maintenance of marmosets in captivity may trigger various
disorders. The objective of this study was to provide a radiographic evaluation
of the forelimbs and hind limbs of marmosets rescued from illegal wildlife trade 
and maintained in captivity.
METHODS: Fourteen marmosets were studied.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Three marmosets were apparently normal. Of the eleven
marmosets with radiographic changes in the hind limbs, five had pelvic narrowing 
and bilateral varus deviation of the femur, with one suggestive of rickets and
another of osteomalacia. The other marmosets showed changes such as malunion of
acetabular fracture, transtibial amputation, tibial antecurvatum, and knee
osteoarthritis. Six marmosets showed alterations in the forelimbs such as radius 
fracture, scapulohumeral subluxation, and elbow joint incongruence. In
conclusion, 78.57% of the marmosets had bone and/or joint changes detected by
plain radiography, which were found predominantly in the hind limbs and without
impediment to locomotion in captivity.

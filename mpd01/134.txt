We determined the retinal ganglion cell types projecting to the medial
subdivision of inferior pulvinar (PIm) and the superior colliculus (SC) in the
common marmoset monkey, Callithrix jacchus. Adult marmosets received a
bidirectional tracer cocktail into the PIm (conjugated to Alexa fluor 488), and
the SC (conjugated to Alexa fluor 594) using an MRI-guided approach. One SC
injection included the pretectum. The large majority of retrogradely labelled
cells were obtained from SC injections, with only a small proportion obtained
after PIm injections. Retrogradely labelled cells were injected intracellularly
in vitro using lipophilic dyes (DiI, DiO). The SC and PIm both received input
from a variety of ganglion cell types. Input to the PIm was dominated by broad
thorny (41%), narrow thorny (24%) and large bistratified (25%) ganglion cells.
Input to the SC was dominated by parasol (37%), broad thorny (24%) and narrow
thorny (17%) cells. Midget ganglion cells (which make up the large majority of
primate retinal ganglion cells) and small bistratified (blue-ON/yellow OFF) cells
were never observed to project to SC or PIm. Small numbers of other wide-field
ganglion cell types were also encountered. Giant sparse (presumed
melanopsin-expressing) cells were only seen following the tracer injection which 
included the pretectum. We note that despite the location of pulvinar complex in 
dorsal thalamus, and its increased size and functional importance in primate
evolution, the retinal projections to pulvinar have more in common with SC
projections than they do with projections to the dorsal lateral geniculate
nucleus.

Age-related cognitive decline has been extensively studied in humans, but the
majority of research designs are cross-sectional and compare across younger and
older adults. Longitudinal studies are necessary to capture variability in
cognitive aging trajectories but are difficult to carry out in humans and
long-lived nonhuman primates. Marmosets are an ideal primate model for
neurocognitive aging as their naturally short lifespan facilitates longitudinal
designs. In a longitudinal study of marmosets tested on reversal learning
starting in middle-age, we found that, on average, the group of marmosets
declined in cognitive performance around 8 years of age. However, we found highly
variable patterns of cognitive aging trajectories across individuals. Preliminary
analyses of brain tissues from this cohort also show highly variable degrees of
neuropathology. Future work will tie together behavioral trajectories with brain 
pathology and provide a window into the factors that predict age-related
cognitive decline.

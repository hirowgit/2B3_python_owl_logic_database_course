BACKGROUND: This study determined the pharmacokinetics of the contrast agent
gadobutrol in marmosets by quantitative MRI to derive guidelines for neuroimaging
protocols.
METHODS: Local concentrations of gadobutrol were determined from consecutive
gradient echo-based mapping of the relaxation rate R1 on a clinical 3T MRI
scanner. Half-time of renal elimination was measured after injection of a triple 
dose of gadobutrol (0.3 mmol/kg) into the saphenous vein. A first-order
single-compartment model was fitted to the measured R1 values and verified by
blood analysis.
RESULTS: Slow injection (1.5 minutes) resulted in an elimination half-time of
26±4 minutes. After bolus injection (15 seconds), elimination was much slower
(62±8 minutes) with 45% larger distribution volumes. Importantly, more gadobutrol
entered the cerebrospinal fluid.
CONCLUSIONS: Slow injection and a latency of about 20 minutes are recommended to 
avoid extravasation. Application of a triple dose of gadobutrol compensates for
the fast elimination in healthy marmosets.

EBV is the major infectious environmental risk factor for multiple sclerosis
(MS), but the underlying mechanisms remain obscure. Patient studies do not allow 
manipulation in vivo. We used the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE)
models in the common marmoset and rhesus monkey to model the association of EBV
and MS. We report that B cells infected with EBV-related lymphocryptovirus (LCV) 
are requisite APCs for MHC-E-restricted autoaggressive effector memory CTLs
specific for the immunodominant epitope 40-48 of myelin oligodendrocyte
glycoprotein (MOG). These T cells drive the EAE pathogenesis to irreversible
neurologic deficit. The aim of this study was to determine why LCV infection is
important for this pathogenic role of B cells. Transcriptome comparison of
LCV-infected B cells and CD20(+) spleen cells from rhesus monkeys shows increased
expression of genes encoding elements of the Ag cross-presentation machinery
(i.e., of proteasome maturation protein and immunoproteasome subunits) and
enhanced expression of MHC-E and of costimulatory molecules (CD70 and CD80, but
not CD86). It was also shown that altered expression of endolysosomal proteases
(cathepsins) mitigates the fast endolysosomal degradation of the MOG40-48 core
epitope. Finally, LCV infection also induced expression of LC3-II(+) cytosolic
structures resembling autophagosomes, which seem to form an intracellular
compartment where the MOG40-48 epitope is protected against proteolytic
degradation by the endolysosomal serine protease cathepsin G. In conclusion, LCV 
infection induces a variety of changes in B cells that underlies the conversion
of destructive processing of the immunodominant MOG40-48 epitope into productive 
processing and cross-presentation to strongly autoaggressive CTLs.

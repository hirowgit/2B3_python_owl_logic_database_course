The common marmoset is a small nonhuman primate in which the application of
transgenesis and genetic knockout techniques allows the generation of
gene-modified models of human diseases. However, its longer generation time than 
that of rodents is a major obstacle to the widespread use of gene-modified
marmosets for biomedical research. In this study, we examined the feasibility of 
shortening the generation time by using prepubertal marmoset males as gamete
donors. We collected late round stage spermatids (Steps 5-7), elongated
spermatids, and testicular spermatozoa from the testis of a prepubertal
11-month-old male marmoset and injected them into in vitro-matured oocytes. After
7 days in culture, two embryos from elongated spermatid injection and two embryos
from sperm injection were transferred into two separate recipient females. The
recipient female that received elongated spermatid injection-derived embryos
became pregnant and gave birth to one female infant. This is the first
demonstration that a spermatid from a prepubertal male primate can support
full-term development. Using this method, we can expect to obtain offspring of
gene-modified males 6 months to a year earlier than with natural mating.

Primates with primary visual cortex (V1) damage often retain residual motion
sensitivity, which is hypothesized to be mediated by middle temporal area (MT).
MT neurons continue to respond to stimuli shortly after V1 lesions; however,
experimental and clinical studies of lesion-induced plasticity have shown that
lesion effects can take several months to stabilize. It is unknown what
physiological changes occur in MT and whether neural responses persist long after
V1 damage. We recorded neuronal responses in MT to moving dot patterns in adult
marmoset monkeys 6-12 months after unilateral V1 lesions. In contrast to results 
obtained shortly after V1 lesions, we found that fewer MT neurons were direction 
selective, including neurons expected to still receive projections from remaining
parts of V1. The firing rates of most cells increased with increases in motion
strength, regardless of stimulus direction. Furthermore, firing rates were higher
and more variable than in control MT cells. To test whether these observations
could be mechanistically explained by underlying changes in neural circuitry, we 
created a network model of MT. We found that a local imbalance of inhibition and 
excitation explained the observed firing rate changes. These results provide the 
first insights into functional implications of long-term plasticity in MT
following V1 lesions.

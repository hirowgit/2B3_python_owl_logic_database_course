Administration of MPTP (1-4 mg/kg ip daily for 5-7 days) to common marmosets
induced persistent parkinsonian motor deficits. The subcutaneous administration
of (+)-PHNO [(+)-4-propyl-9-hydroxynaphthoxazine; 1-4 micrograms/kg] caused a
dose-dependent reversal of the akinesia and incoordination of movement.
Similarly, oral administration of (+)-PHNO (5-20 micrograms/kg) caused an
equivalent reversal of the motor abnormalities. No dyskinetic phenomena were
induced by (+)-PHNO on oral or subcutaneous administration. Oral or subcutaneous 
administration of (+)-PHNO to normal control marmosets also increased the usual
repetoire of motor behaviour, but this was not as marked as in MPTP-treated
animals. (+)-PHNO is a potent dopamine agonist drug of potential use in the
treatment of Parkinson's disease.

Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) is a glycoprotein hormone required for female 
and male gametogenesis in vertebrates. Common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a 
New World primate monkey, used as animal model in biomedical research.
Observations like, requirement of extremely high dose of human FSH in marmosets
for superovulation compared to other primates and generation of antibodies in
marmoset against human FSH after repeated superovulation cycles, point towards
the possibility that FSH-FSH receptor (FSHR) interaction in marmosets might be
different than in the humans. In this study we attempted to understand some of
these structural differences using FSH peptides and anti-peptide antibody
approach. Based on sequence alignment, in silico modeling and docking studies, L2
loop of FSH β-subunit (L2β) was found to be different between marmoset and human.
Hence, peptides corresponding to region 32-50 of marmoset and human L2β loop were
synthesized, purified and characterized. The peptides displayed dissimilarity in 
terms of molecular mass, predicted isoelectric point, predicted charge and in the
ability to inhibit hormone-receptor interaction. Polyclonal antibodies generated 
against both the peptides were found to exhibit specific binding for the
corresponding peptide and parent FSH in ELISA and Western blotting respectively
and exhibited negligible reactivity to cross-species peptide and FSH in ELISA.
The anti-peptide antibody against marmoset FSH was also able to detect native FSH
in marmoset plasma samples and pituitary sections. In summary, the L2β loop of
marmoset and human FSH has distinct receptor interaction ability and
immunoreactivity indicating possibility of subtle conformational and biochemical 
differences between the two regions which may affect the FSH-FSHR interaction in 
these two primates. Copyright © 2016 European Peptide Society and John Wiley &

The main objective of this study was to evaluate sperm morphology in four
neotropical primate species to compare the sperm morphological traits and the
sperm morphometric parameters as a basis for establishing normative sperm
standards for each species. Data from 80 ejaculates collected from four primate
species, Callithrix jacchus, Callimico goeldii, Alouatta caraya and Ateles
geoffroyi, were analysed for detection of sperm morphological alterations using
subjective World Health Organization (WHO-2010) standards and Sperm Deformity
Index (SDI) criteria, objective computer-assisted sperm morphometry analysis
(CASMA) and subpopulation sperm determination (SSD) methods. There were multiple 
differences (p < 0.01) observed among primate species in values obtained from
WHO-2010, SDI, CASMA and SSD sperm analysis methods. In addition, multiple
significant positive and negative correlations were observed between the sperm
morphological traits (SDI, Sperm Deformity Index Head Defects, Sperm Deformity
Index Midpiece Defects, Sperm Deformity Index Tail Defects, Normal Sperm, Head
Defects, Midpiece Defects and Tail Defects) and the sperm morphometric parameters
(SSD, Area (A), Perimeter (P), Length (L), Width (W), Ellipticity, Elongation and
Rugosity) (p ≤ 0.046). In conclusion, our findings using different evaluation
methods indicate that pronounced sperm morphological variation exists among these
four neotropical primate species. Because of the strong relationship observed
among morphological and morphometric parameters, these results suggest that
application of objective analysis methods could substantially improve the
reliability of comparative studies and help to establish valid normative sperm
values for neotropical primates.

Structural and functional abnormalities of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) have
been implicated in affective disorders that manifest anxiety-related symptoms.
However, research into the functions of primate OFC has predominantly focused on 
reward-oriented rather than threat-oriented responses. To redress this imbalance,
the present study performed a comprehensive analysis of the independent role of 2
distinct subregions of the central OFC (anterior area 11; aOFC and posterior area
13; pOFC) in the processing of distal and proximal threat. Temporary inactivation
of both aOFC and pOFC heightened responses to distal threat in the form of an
unknown human, but not to proximal threat assessed in a discriminative Pavlovian 
conditioning task. Inactivation of the aOFC, however, did unexpectedly blunt
conditioned threat responses, although the effect was not valence-specific, as
conditioned appetitive responses were similarly blunted and appeared restricted
to a discriminative version of the task (when both CS- and CS+ are present within
a session). Inactivation of the pOFC did not affect conditioned responses to
either proximal threat or reward and basal cardiovascular activity was unaffected
by manipulations of activity in either subregion. The results highlight the
contribution of aOFC and pOFC to regulation of responses to more distal uncertain
but not proximal, certain threat and reveal their opposing contribution to that
of the immediately adjacent medial OFC, area 14.

The common marmoset has enormous promise as a nonhuman primate model of human
brain functions. While resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) has provided evidence 
for a similar organization of marmoset and human cortices, the technique cannot
be used to map the functional correspondences of brain regions between species.
This limitation can be overcome by movie-driven fMRI (md-fMRI), which has become 
a popular tool for noninvasively mapping the neural patterns generated by rich
and naturalistic stimulation. Here, we used md-fMRI in marmosets and humans to
identify whole-brain functional correspondences between the two primate species. 
In particular, we describe functional correlates for the well-known human face,
body, and scene patches in marmosets. We find that these networks have a similar 
organization in both species, suggesting a largely conserved organization of
higher-order visual areas between New World marmoset monkeys and humans. However,
while face patches in humans and marmosets were activated by marmoset faces, only
human face patches responded to the faces of other animals. Together, the results
demonstrate that higher-order visual processing might be a conserved feature
between humans and New World marmoset monkeys but that small, potentially
important functional differences exist.

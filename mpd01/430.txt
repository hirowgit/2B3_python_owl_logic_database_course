Background: Recently, the use of common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) has
increased in biomedical research as an animal model. This study aimed to test
fecal samples to monitor bacterial and parasite infections in common marmoset at 
the Laboratory Animal Center of Osong Medical Innovation Foundation in Korea.
Methods: To monitor bacteria and parasites in common marmoset, we tested 43 fecal
samples of 43 common marmosets by culture and parasitological test in 2014.
Infection by Chilomastix mesnili was determined by PCR method.
Results: We identified nonpathogenic bacteria such as Proteus mirabilis and
Escherichia coli in feces of normal common marmosets. Interestingly, C. mesnili
was isolated from a healthy common marmoset by fecal centrifugation concentration
and PCR. The monkey infected with C. mesnili was treated with metronidazole.
After the treatment, C. mesnili were not found in feces using fecal
centrifugation concentration and PCR.
Conclusion: This is the first case report of C. mesnili infection in common
marmoset. Treatment with metronidazole is found to be highly effective in
eradicating C. mesnili infection in common marmoset.

Restraint is widely used to experimentally assess stress-induced effects.
Surprisingly, little is known on how marmosets - an increasingly used small
primate - process and respond to restraint stress. Here, we assessed blood
cortisol concentration and tympanic membrane temperatures (TMT) in adult marmoset
monkeys (Callithrix penicillata) during 0, 15, or 30 min of restraint and social 
isolation in a small cage. TMT reflects blood flow to the cerebral hemispheres,
which in turn reflects neural activity. Baseline TMT were subtracted from
post-test measures to establish shifts in blood flow possibly induced by
ipsilateral brain activity. Cortisol was assayed immediately after the post-test 
assessment of the TMT. Marmosets restrained-isolated for 15 or 30 min had higher 
cortisol levels than the non-restrained-isolated group. Furthermore, significant 
changes in TMT were detected only in the right ear of the restrained-isolated
groups, this effect being unrelated to overall body temperature or the time
needed to capture/measure the TMT. Adult marmosets thus readily perceive a
significant reduction in their range of movement as an event of sufficient
negative intensity and/or duration to activate a pertinent neuroendocrine
response. Also, an asymmetrical shift in their TMT reflects that such an aversive
event may be rightwardly biased in this primate.

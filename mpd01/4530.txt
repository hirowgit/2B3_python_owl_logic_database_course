The effects of cryopreservation and transfer on embryonic development in the
common marmoset monkey, Callithrix jacchus.

Summers PM, Shephard AM, Taylor CT, Hearn JP.

Embryos were collected at the 4-10-cell stage from the oviducts (Day 4; Day 1 =
ovulation) or as morulae (Day 7) from the uterus of marmosets and frozen in 1.5
M-DMSO (Days 4 and 7) or 1.0 M-glycerol (Day 4 only), using a slow freezing and
thawing technique. Of 22 Day-4 embryos frozen in DMSO, 18 were recovered and 16
of these were transferred to 10 synchronized recipients; 7 recipients became
pregnant compared with all 7 control recipients receiving 10 unfrozen embryos.
Fifteen frozen-thawed morulae were transferred to 9 Day-6 recipients; the
pregnancy rate (55.6%) was lower than for control embryos (85.7%). Embryos frozen
in glycerol suffered severe osmotic stress during glycerol addition and removal. 
Of 8 recipients, 3 (37.5%) became pregnant but only one fetus was carried to
term. These results on embryo collection, freezing and transfer in the marmoset
have important implications for developing improved methods for freezing human
embryos and the breeding of endangered primates.

Failure of the prostaglandin F2 alpha analogue, cloprostenol, to induce
functional luteolysis in the olive baboon (Papio cynocephalus anubis).

Eley RM, Summers PM, Hearn JP.

The prostaglandin F2 alpha analogue, cloprostenol, which is an effective
luteolytic agent in the common marmoset, was administered intramuscularly to
olive baboons to determine if it possessed luteolytic properties in this species.
The results showed that functional luteolysis was not induced when cloprostenol
was administered during the mid- to late luteal phase or during early pregnancy.

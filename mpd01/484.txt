Primates with primary visual cortex (V1) damage often retain residual motion
sensitivity, which is hypothesized to be mediated by middle temporal area (MT).
MT neurons continue to respond to stimuli shortly after V1 lesions; however,
experimental and clinical studies of lesion-induced plasticity have shown that
lesion effects can take several months to stabilize. It is unknown what
physiological changes occur in MT and whether neural responses persist long after
V1 damage. We recorded neuronal responses in MT to moving dot patterns in adult
marmoset monkeys 6-12 months after unilateral V1 lesions. In contrast to results 
obtained shortly after V1 lesions, we found that fewer MT neurons were direction 
selective, including neurons expected to still receive projections from remaining
parts of V1. The firing rates of most cells increased with increases in motion
strength, regardless of stimulus direction. Furthermore, firing rates were higher
and more variable than in control MT cells. To test whether these observations
could be mechanistically explained by underlying changes in neural circuitry, we 
created a network model of MT. We found that a local imbalance of inhibition and 
excitation explained the observed firing rate changes. These results provide the 
first insights into functional implications of long-term plasticity in MT
following V1 lesions.

Understanding the set of factors that promote and constrain a species' ability to
exploit ecologically distinct habitats is central for addressing questions of
intraspecific variability in behavior and morphology. In this study, we compared 
newly collected data with published data on body measurements, group size and
composition, daily path length, home range, and reproductive output in wild
common marmosets naturally inhabiting two contrasting environments in
northeastern Brazil: the Atlantic Forest (AF), which is characterized by high
biodiversity and reduced seasonality in food availability and the Caatinga (CAT),
which is characterized by a severe hot and dry season lasting from 5 to 11
months, drought-resistant plant species, and reduced primary productivity.
Despite marked differences in ecological conditions, CAT marmosets and AF
marmosets differed minimally in daily path length, home range, reproductive
output, and infant survivorship. CAT marmosets were found to live in smaller
groups containing fewer adult females than AF marmosets, and also were
characterized by a greater surface area to body mass ratio, a trait that may
represent an adaptation to the hot and dry conditions of the Caatinga. We propose
that in conjunction with body mass reduction, minor adjustments in behavior, the 
exploitation of cacti as a source of water and nutrients, and access to exudates 
as a dependable year-round food resource, common marmosets successfully used the 
same adaptive pattern to maintain high reproductive output and infant
survivorship in exploiting these two ecologically distinct environments.

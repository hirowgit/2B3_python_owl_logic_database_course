Precise cochlear neuronal development is vital to hearing ability. Understanding 
the developmental process of the spiral ganglion is useful for studying hearing
loss aimed at aging or regenerative therapy. Although interspecies differences
have been reported between rodents and humans, to date, most of our knowledge
about the development of cochlear neuronal development has been obtained from
rodent models because of the difficulty in using human fetal samples in this
field. In this study, we investigated cochlear neuronal development in a small
New World monkey species, the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). We examined
more than 25 genes involved in the neuronal development of the cochlea and
described the critical developmental steps of these neurons. We also revealed
similarities and differences between previously reported rodent models and this
primate animal model. Our results clarified that this animal model of cochlear
neuronal development is more similar to humans than rodents and is suitable as an
alternative for the analysis of human cochlear development. The time course
established in this report will be a useful tool for studying primate-specific
neuronal biology of the inner ear, which could eventually lead to new treatment
strategies for human hearing loss.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a multifactorial disorder with characteristic
synaptic and gene expression changes. Early intervention during childhood is
thought to benefit prognosis. Here, we examined the changes in cortical
synaptogenesis, synaptic function, and gene expression from birth to the juvenile
stage in a marmoset model of ASD induced by valproic acid (VPA) treatment. Early 
postnatally, synaptogenesis was reduced in this model, while juvenile-age
VPA-treated marmosets showed increased synaptogenesis, similar to observations in
human tissue. During infancy, synaptic plasticity transiently increased and was
associated with altered vocalization. Synaptogenesis-related genes were
downregulated early postnatally. At three months of age, the differentially
expressed genes were associated with circuit remodeling, similar to the
expression changes observed in humans. In summary, we provide a functional and
molecular characterization of a non-human primate model of ASD, highlighting its 
similarity to features observed in human ASD.

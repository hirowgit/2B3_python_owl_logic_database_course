OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical and physiological effects of intravenous
(IV) alfaxalone alone or in combination with buprenorphine, butorphanol or
tramadol premedication in marmosets.
STUDY DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, blinded, crossover design.
ANIMALS: Nine healthy marmosets (391 ± 48 g, 3.7 ± 2.2 years old).
METHODS: Meloxicam 0.20 mg kg-1 subcutaneously, atropine 0.05 mg kg-1
intramuscularly (IM) and either buprenorphine 20 μg kg-1 IM (BUP-A), butorphanol 
0.2 mg kg-1 IM (BUT-A), tramadol 1.5 mg kg-1 IM (TRA-A) or no additional drug
(control) were administered to all marmosets as premedication. After 1 hour,
anaesthesia was induced with 16 mg kg-1 alfaxalone IV. All animals received all
protocols. The order of protocol allocation was randomized with a minimum 28 day 
wash-out period. During anaesthesia, respiratory and pulse rates, rectal
temperature, haemoglobin oxygen saturation, arterial blood pressure, palpebral
and pedal withdrawal reflexes and degree of muscle relaxation were assessed and
recorded every 5 minutes. Quality of induction and recovery were assessed.
Duration of induction, immobilization and recovery were recorded. Blood samples
were analysed for aspartate aminotransferase, creatine kinase and lactate
dehydrogenase concentrations. The protocols were compared using paired t tests,
Wilcoxon's signed-rank test with Bonferroni's corrections and linear mixed effect
models where appropriate.
RESULTS: Out of nine animals, apnoea was noted in eight animals administered
protocol BUP-A and two animals administered protocol BUT-A. With TRA-A and
control protocols, apnoea was not observed. No other significant differences in
any of the parameters were found; however, low arterial blood pressures and
hypoxia occurred in TRA-A.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Our study employing different premedications 
suggests that the previously published dose of 16 mg kg-1 alfaxalone is too high 
when used with premedication because we found a high incidence of complications
including apnoea (BUP-A), hypotension and hypoxaemia (TRA-A). Appropriate
monitoring and countermeasures are recommended.

Common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) are potentially useful nonhuman primate
models for preclinical studies. An anti-inflammatory drug, diclofenac is
reportedly metabolized mainly by human cytochrome P450 (P450) 2C9 to
4'-hydroxydiclofenac and minorly by P450 3A4 to 5-hydroxydiclofenac that leads to
reactive intermediates. In this study, in vivo pharmacokinetics in six marmosets 
and in vitro metabolism in nine marmoset liver microsomes were analyzed using
diclofenac to evaluate marmosets as preclinical drug metabolism models. In
wild-type marmosets genotyped for P450 2C19 p.[(Phe7Leu; Ser254Leu; Ile469Thr)], 
plasma levels of 5-hydroxydiclofenac and 4'-hydroxydiclofenac were roughly
similar, but the homozygotes showed approximately three-times higher plasma
levels of 5-hydroxydiclofenac than those of 4'-hydroxydiclofenac after oral
administrations of diclofenac (50 mg/kg). Nine marmoset liver microsomes
catalyzed mainly diclofenac 5-hydroxylation with no significant effects of the
the P450 2C19 genotype, and partly diclofenac 4'-hydroxylation that depended on
the P450 2C19 genotype, at substrate concentrations of 10 µM and 100 µM. Both
Michaels-Menten constant Km values for diclofenac 4'-hydroxylation in human and
marmoset liver microsomes were ∼30 μM and those for diclofenac 5-hydroxylation
were ∼120 μM. Ketoconazole significantly suppressed only diclofenac
5-hydroxylation in marmoset or human liver microsomes at 0.030 μM, indicating
main contribution of P450 3A enzymes, which were found to be P450 3A5/90 using
recombinant marmoset P450 3A enzymes. These results suggest that marmosets would 
be a functional animal model for in vivo and in vitro metabolites likely
generated via arene oxide intermediates of diclofenac by P450 3A enzymes in
humans, primarily because marmosets lack the ortholog of human P450 2C9.

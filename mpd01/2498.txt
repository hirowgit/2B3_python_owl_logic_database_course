Human adults generally find fast tempos more arousing than slow tempos, with
tempo frequently manipulated in music to alter tension and emotion. We used a
previously published method [McDermott, J., & Hauser, M. (2004). Are consonant
intervals music to their ears? Spontaneous acoustic preferences in a nonhuman
primate. Cognition, 94(2), B11-B21] to test cotton-top tamarins and common
marmosets, two new-World primates, for their spontaneous responses to stimuli
that varied systematically with respect to tempo. Across several experiments, we 
found that both tamarins and marmosets preferred slow tempos to fast. It is
possible that the observed preferences were due to arousal, and that this effect 
is homologous to the human response to tempo. In other respects, however, these
two monkey species showed striking differences compared to humans. Specifically, 
when presented with a choice between slow tempo musical stimuli, including
lullabies, and silence, tamarins and marmosets preferred silence whereas humans, 
when similarly tested, preferred music. Thus despite the possibility of
homologous mechanisms for tempo perception in human and nonhuman primates, there 
appear to be motivational ties to music that are uniquely human.

BACKGROUND: Like other herpes viruses, latent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection 
can be reactivated to lytic replication. Reactivation can be achieved by
treatment with various reagents, including tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate (TPA)
and Ca2+ ionophores. Relatively little is known about the physiological factors
related to reactivation of EBV. Previous studies have demonstrated that G0/G1
cell cycle arrest is associated with EBV activation, and that hypoxic conditions 
can induce cell cycle arrest. In the present study we investigated the effect of 
hypoxia on reactivation of EBV.
OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: Hypoxic culture conditions were established and the
expression of Zta protein and the number of EBV DNA copies were measured in B95-8
cells maintained under these conditions.
RESULTS: Hypoxia treatment not only increased the expression of the EBV
immediate-early protein Zta (which mediates the switch between the latent and
lytic form of infection), but also increased the number of EBV DNA copies in
B95-8 cells.
CONCLUSIONS: EBV in latent infection can be activated to lytic infection by
hypoxia treatment.

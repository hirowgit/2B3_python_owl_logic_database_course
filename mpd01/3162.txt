RATIONALE: Motivational effects of psychotropic drugs may contribute to their
therapeutic profile and progressive ratio (PR) schedules provide a method of
measuring these effects in animals.
OBJECTIVE: Determine effects of selected antipsychotic, psychotomimetic,
anxiolytic and antidepressant drugs on PR performance in common marmosets.
METHOD: Marmosets were trained to lever press for banana milkshake reinforcement 
using a PR schedule, in which the number of lever presses to achieve successive
reinforcements increased by one until responding ceased (breakpoint).
RESULTS: Clozapine administered intramuscularly (0.01-2 mg/kg IM; 30 min
pretreatment time (ptt) or by oral gavage (0.1-4 mg/kg PO; 60 min ptt)
significantly increased the breakpoint. Independent tests of fluid consumption
failed to show enhanced fluid intake after clozapine pretreatment, suggesting
this effect was not due to drug induced polydipsia. Neither haloperidol
(0.005-0.1 mg/kg PO; 60 min ptt) nor risperidone (0.0025-0.05 mg/kg PO; 60 min
ptt) altered breakpoint. Olanzapine (0.01-1 mg/kg PO; 60 min ptt) significantly
enhanced the breakpoint at 0.05 mg/kg PO, but the effect was not robust.
Amphetamine (0.2-2 mg/kg SC; 30 min ptt) significantly reduced the breakpoint at 
2 mg/kg and fluoxetine (0.1-1 mg/kg PO; 60 min ptt) was without effect. Diazepam 
significantly increased the breakpoint at 0.5 mg/kg PO. Drug-induced polydipsia
might play a role in this response as independent tests showed increased fluid
consumption following diazepam.
CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that, unlike other antipsychotics,
clozapine over a wide dose range increased the motivational state of marmosets to
respond for banana milkshake. This motivational aspect of clozapine's actions may
contribute to its unique clinical profile and the PR procedure may provide a
method for detecting novel antipsychotics with a clozapine-like profile.

Morbilliviruses comprise measles virus, canine distemper virus, rinderpest virus,
and several other viruses that cause devastating human and animal diseases
accompanied by severe immunosuppression and lymphopenia. Recently, we have shown 
that human signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM) is a cellular receptor
for measles virus. In this study, we examined whether canine distemper and
rinderpest viruses also use canine and bovine SLAMs, respectively, as cellular
receptors. The Onderstepoort vaccine strain and two B95a (marmoset B cell
line)-isolated strains of canine distemper virus caused extensive cytopathic
effects in normally resistant CHO (Chinese hamster ovary) cells after expression 
of canine SLAM. The Ako vaccine strain of rinderpest virus produced strong
cytopathic effects in bovine SLAM-expressing CHO cells. The data on entry with
vesicular stomatitis virus pseudotypes bearing measles, canine distemper, or
rinderpest virus envelope proteins were consistent with development of cytopathic
effects in SLAM-expressing CHO cell clones after infection with the respective
viruses, confirming that SLAM acts at the virus entry step (as a cellular
receptor). Furthermore, most measles, canine distemper, and rinderpest virus
strains examined could any use of the human, canine, and bovine SLAMs to infect
cells. Our findings suggest that the use of SLAM as a cellular receptor may be a 
property common to most, if not all, morbilliviruses and explain the
lymphotropism and immunosuppressive nature of morbilliviruses.

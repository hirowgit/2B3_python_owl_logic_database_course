Unlike visual signals, sound can reach the ears from any direction, and the
ability to localize sounds from all directions is essential for survival in a
natural environment. Previous studies have largely focused on the space in front 
of a subject that is also covered by vision and were often limited to measuring
spatial tuning along the horizontal (azimuth) plane. As a result, we know
relatively little about how the auditory cortex responds to sounds coming from
spatial locations outside the frontal space where visual information is
unavailable. By mapping single-neuron responses to the full spatial field in
awake marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), an arboreal animal for which spatial
processing is vital in its natural habitat, we show that spatial receptive fields
in several auditory areas cover all spatial locations. Several complementary
measures of spatial tuning showed that neurons were tuned to both frontal space
and rear space (outside the coverage of vision), as well as the space above and
below the horizontal plane. Together, these findings provide valuable new
insights into the representation of all spatial locations by primate auditory
cortex.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a useful experimental animal to
evaluate the pharmacokinetics of drug candidates. Cytochrome P450 (P450) 2B
enzyme in marmoset livers has been identified; however, only limited information 
on the enzymatic properties and distribution has been available. Marmoset P450
2B6 amino acids showed high sequence identities (>86%) with those of primates
including humans and cynomolgus monkeys. Phylogenetic analysis using amino acid
sequences indicated that marmoset P450 2B6 was closer to human and cynomolgus
monkey P450 2B6 than to P450 2B orthologs of other species, including pigs, dogs,
rabbits and rodents. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis using
specific primers showed P450 2B6 mRNA predominantly expressed in livers among the
five marmoset tissues, similar to those of humans and cynomolgus monkeys.
Marmoset P450 2B6 heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli membranes oxidized
7-ethoxycoumarin, pentoxyresorufin, propofol and testosterone, at roughly similar
rates to those of humans and/or cynomolgus monkeys. A high capacity of marmoset
P450 2B6 with propofol 4-hydroxylation (at low ionic strength conditions) with a 
low Km value was relatively comparable to that for marmoset livers. These results
collectively indicated a high propofol 4-hydroxylation activity of P450 2B6
expressed in marmoset livers.

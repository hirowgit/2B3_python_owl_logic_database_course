BACKGROUND: The maintenance of marmosets in captivity may trigger various
disorders. The objective of this study was to provide a radiographic evaluation
of the forelimbs and hind limbs of marmosets rescued from illegal wildlife trade 
and maintained in captivity.
METHODS: Fourteen marmosets were studied.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Three marmosets were apparently normal. Of the eleven
marmosets with radiographic changes in the hind limbs, five had pelvic narrowing 
and bilateral varus deviation of the femur, with one suggestive of rickets and
another of osteomalacia. The other marmosets showed changes such as malunion of
acetabular fracture, transtibial amputation, tibial antecurvatum, and knee
osteoarthritis. Six marmosets showed alterations in the forelimbs such as radius 
fracture, scapulohumeral subluxation, and elbow joint incongruence. In
conclusion, 78.57% of the marmosets had bone and/or joint changes detected by
plain radiography, which were found predominantly in the hind limbs and without
impediment to locomotion in captivity.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an adult onset neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by the death of upper and lower motor neurons. About 10% of all ALS
cases are familial, and we have identified SOD1 and FUS mutations as the most
common causes in a consecutive series of 111 familial ALS pedigrees in Japan
(Nishiyama A, 2017). From studies of the TDP43, FUS, and C9orf72 genes,
perturbations of RNA processing can be highly adverse in motor neurons.
Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is one of the most potent survival-promoting
factors for motor neurons. We administered human recombinant HGF (hrHGF) by
continuous intrathecal delivery to transgenic rats at onset of paralysis for 4
weeks. Intrathecal administration of hrHGF attenuated motor neuron degeneration
and prolonged the duration of the disease by 63% (Ishigaki A, 2007). To translate
this strategy to human treatment, we induced a contusive cervical spinal cord
injury in the common marmoset, a primate, and then administered hrHGF
intrathecally. We conducted a first-in-human phase I trial of intrathecal hrHGF
in 15 Japanese patients with ALS (Warita H, 2019). Based on the results, we are
conducting a phase II trial of intrathecal hrHGF for patients with ALS.

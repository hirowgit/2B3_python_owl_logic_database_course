The acoustic properties of vocalizations in common marmosets differ between
populations. These differences may be the result of social vocal learning, but
they can also result from environmental or genetic differences between
populations. We performed translocation experiments to separately quantify the
influence of a change in the physical environment (experiment 1), and a change in
the social environment (experiment 2) on the acoustic properties of calls from
individual captive common marmosets. If population differences were due to
genetic differences, we expected no change in the vocalizations of the
translocated marmosets. If differences were due to environmental factors, we
expected vocalizations to permanently change contingent with environmental
changes. If social learning was involved, we expected that the vocalizations of
animals translocated to a new population with a different dialect would become
more similar to the new population. In experiment 1, we translocated marmosets to
a different physical environment without changing the social composition of the
groups or their neighbours. Immediately after the translocation to the new
facility, one out of three call types showed a significant change in call
structure, but 5-6 weeks later, the calls were no longer different from before
the translocation. Thus, the novel physical environment did not induce long
lasting changes in the vocalizations of the marmosets. In experiment 2, we
translocated marmosets to a new population with a different dialect. Importantly,
our previous work had shown that these two populations differed significantly in 
vocalization structure. The translocated marmosets were still housed in their
original social group, but after translocation they were surrounded by the
vocalizations from neighbouring groups of the new population. The vocal distance 
between the translocated individuals and the new population decreased for two out
of three call types over 16 weeks. Thus, even without direct social contact or
interaction, the vocalizations of the translocated animals converged towards the 
new population, indicating that common marmosets can modify their calls due to
acoustic input from conspecifics alone, via crowd vocal learning. To our
knowledge, this is the first study able to distinguish between different
explanations for vocal dialects as well as to show crowd vocal learning in a
primate species.

Optogenetics is now a fundamental tool for investigating the relationship between
neuronal activity and behavior. However, its application to the investigation of 
motor control systems in nonhuman primates is rather limited, because optogenetic
stimulation of cortical neurons in nonhuman primates has failed to induce or
modulate any hand/arm movements. Here, we used a tetracycline-inducible gene
expression system carrying CaMKII promoter and the gene encoding a
Channelrhodopsin-2 variant with fast kinetics in the common marmoset, a small New
World monkey. In an awake state, forelimb movements could be induced when
Channelrhodopsin-2-expressing neurons in the motor cortex were illuminated by
blue laser light with a spot diameter of 1 mm or 2 mm through a cranial window
without cortical invasion. Forelimb muscles responded 10 ms to 50 ms after
photostimulation onset. Long-duration (500 ms) photostimulation induced discrete 
forelimb movements that could be markerlessly tracked with charge-coupled device 
cameras and a deep learning algorithm. Long-duration photostimulation mapping
revealed that the primary motor cortex is divided into multiple domains that can 
induce hand and elbow movements in different directions. During performance of a 
forelimb movement task, movement trajectories were modulated by weak
photostimulation, which did not induce visible forelimb movements at rest, around
the onset of task-relevant movement. The modulation was biased toward the
movement direction induced by the strong photostimulation. Combined with calcium 
imaging, all-optical interrogation of motor circuits should be possible in
behaving marmosets.

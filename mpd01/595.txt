Behavioral flexibility, which allows organisms to adapt their actions in response
to environmental changes, is impaired in a number of neuropsychiatric conditions,
including obsessive-compulsive disorder and addiction. Studies in human subjects 
and monkeys have reported correlations between individual differences in dopamine
D2-type receptor (D2R) levels in the caudate nucleus and performance in a
discrimination reversal task, in which established contingent relationships
between abstract stimuli and rewards (or punishments) are reversed. Global
genetic deletion of the D2R in mice disrupts reversal performance, indicating a
likely causal role for this receptor in supporting flexible behaviors. To
directly examine the specific role of caudate D2-type receptors in reversal
performance, the D2/3/4R agonist quinpirole was infused via chronic indwelling
cannulae into the medial caudate of male and female marmoset monkeys performing a
touchscreen-based serial discrimination reversal task. Given prior evidence for
dose-dependent effects of quinpirole and other dopaminergic drugs, a
full dose-response curve was established. Individually, marmosets displayed
marked differences in behavioral sensitivity to specific doses of intra-caudate
quinpirole. Collectively, they exhibited a behaviorally specific bi-phasic
deficit in reversal learning, being consistently impaired at both relatively low 
and high doses of quinpirole. However, intermediate doses of intra-caudate
quinpirole produced significant improvement in reversal performance. These data
support previous human and monkey neuroimaging studies by providing causal
evidence of a U-shaped function describing how dopamine modulates cognitive
flexibility in the primate striatum.

Existence and biomedical relevance of the neurenteric canal, a transient midline 
structure during early neurulation in the human embryo, have been controversially
discussed for more than a century by embryologists and clinicians alike. In this 
study, the authors address the long-standing enigma by high-resolution histology 
and three-dimensional reconstruction using new and historic histological sections
of 5 human 17- to 21-day-old embryos and of 2 marmoset monkey embryos of the
species Callithrix jacchus at corresponding stages. The neurenteric canal
presents itself as the classical vertical connection between the amniotic cavity 
and the yolk sac cavity and is lined (a) craniolaterally by a horseshoe-shaped
"hinge of involuting notochordal cells" within Hensen's node and (b) caudally by 
the receding primitive streak epiblast dorsally and by notochordal plate
epithelium ventrally, the latter of which covered the (longitudinal) notochordal 
canal on its ventral side at the preceding stage. Furthermore, asymmetric
parachordal nodal expression in Callithrix and morphological asymmetries within
the nodes of the other specimens suggest an early non-cilium-dependent left-right
symmetry breaking mode previously postulated for other mammals. We conclude that 
structure and position of the mammalian neurenteric canal support the notion of
its homology with the reptilian blastopore as a whole and with a dorsal segment
of the blastopore in amphibia. These new features of the neurenteric canal may
further clarify the aetiology of foetal malformations such as junctional
neurulation defects, neuroendodermal cysts, and the split notochord syndrome.

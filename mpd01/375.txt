Vocal production is hierarchical in the time domain. These hierarchies build upon
biomechanical and neural dynamics across various timescales. We review studies in
marmoset monkeys, songbirds, and other vertebrates. To organize these data in an 
accessible and across-species framework, we interpret the different timescales of
vocal production as belonging to different levels of an autonomous systems
hierarchy. The first level accounts for vocal acoustics produced on short
timescales; subsequent levels account for longer timescales of vocal output. The 
hierarchy of autonomous systems that we put forth accounts for vocal patterning, 
sequence generation, dyadic interactions, and context dependence by sequentially 
incorporating central pattern generators, intrinsic drives, and sensory signals
from the environment. We then show the framework's utility by providing an
integrative explanation of infant vocal production learning in which social
feedback modulates infant vocal acoustics through the tuning of a drive signal.

Speciation is associated with substantial rewiring of the regulatory circuitry
underlying the expression of genes. Determining which changes are relevant and
underlie the emergence of the human brain or its unique susceptibility to neural 
disease has been challenging. Here we annotate changes to gene regulatory
elements (GREs) at cell type resolution in the brains of multiple primate species
spanning most of primate evolution. We identify a unique set of regulatory
elements that emerged in hominins prior to the separation of humans and
chimpanzees. We demonstrate that these hominin gains perferentially affect
oligodendrocyte function postnatally and are preferentially affected in the
brains of autism patients. This preference is also observed for human-specific
GREs suggesting this system is under continued selective pressure. Our data
provide a roadmap of regulatory rewiring across primate evolution providing
insight into the genomic changes that underlie the emergence of the brain and its
susceptibility to neural disease.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is used as a non-human primate
laboratory animal. Marmoset wasting syndrome (MWS) is a disease endemic to
captive colonies, and the pathogenesis is unclear. In the present study,
marmosets with chronic bloody high-viscosity diarrhea, which is a contributing
factor to MWS, were evaluated, and inflammation in the colon was found.
Calprotectin is a surrogate marker of intestinal inflammation and induces
apoptosis. Marmosets with chronic diarrhea exhibited higher levels of fecal
calprotectin. Histochemical analyses showed high expression of calprotectin in
the extravascular neutrophils and apoptosis in the chronic colitis lesions. No
internal microbiological diseases were identified. Although the cause of chronic 
colitis was not identified, the marmoset could be a useful model of inflammatory 
bowel disease.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to establish reference values for selected
ophthalmic diagnostic tests in healthy neotropical primates from Salvador,
Brazil.
METHODS: A total of 73 intact adults, including Callithrix jacchus (n = 31),
Callithrix penicillata (n = 8), Cebus sp. (n = 22), and Cebus xanthosternos (n = 
9) were used to evaluate the normal conjunctival bacterial flora. Cebus
xanthosternos (n = 12) were used to evaluate tear production with Schirmer's tear
test (STT), intraocular pressure (IOP), and conjunctival cytology.
RESULTS: For all animals evaluated, Gram-positive bacteria were predominant.
Results of the diagnostic tests in Cebus xanthosternos were as follows: STT:
14.92 ± 5.46 mm/minutes, IOP: 19.62 ± 4.57 mmHg, and conjunctival cytology
revealed intermediate squamous epithelial cells in great quantities.
CONCLUSIONS: These ophthalmic reference values will be particularly useful to
diagnose discrete or unusual pathological changes in the neotropical primates
eye.

The excellent adaptability of Callithrix jacchus to life in captivity presents
advantages in comparison to other nonhuman primates that are used in experimental
models for biomedical research, which explains the increasing scientific interest
in investigating the anatomical characteristics of this species. Owing to the
relative scarcity of publications on the descriptive morphology of the heart of
C. jacchus, the aim of this study was to quantify the presence of collagen in the
left and right ventricular myocardium using modified picrosirius red and acid
fuchsine colorimetric assays. The myocardium of the right ventricle presented a
higher percentage of collagen than that of the left ventricle. No sex-related
differences were observed between the groups. Interestingly, the absolute values 
of collagen were different depending on the method used for quantification
(modified picrosirius red vs. acid fuchsine). The level of collagen
quantification observed in the ventricular myocardium of C. jacchus was similar
to that seen in other nonhuman primates traditionally used in experimental models
of cardiac diseases.

The marmoset has emerged as a promising primate model system, in particular for
visual neuroscience. Many common experimental paradigms rely on head fixation and
an extended period of eye fixation during the presentation of salient visual
stimuli. Both of these behavioral requirements can be challenging for marmosets. 
Here, we present two methodological developments, each addressing one of these
difficulties. First, we show that it is possible to use a standard eye-tracking
system without head fixation to assess visual behavior in the marmoset.
Eye-tracking quality from head-free animals is sufficient to obtain precise
psychometric functions from a visual acuity task. Second, we introduce a novel
method for efficient receptive field (RF) mapping that does not rely on moving
stimuli but uses fast flashing annuli and wedges. We present data recorded during
head-fixation in areas V1 and V6 and show that RF locations are readily obtained 
within a short period of recording time. Thus, the methodological advancements
presented in this work will contribute to establish the marmoset as a valuable
model in neuroscience.

The high case-fatality rate of confirmed MERS-CoV infections underlines the
urgent need for an effective treatment to reduce the disease severity and
mortality. REGN3051 and REGN3048 are two fully human neutralizing monoclonal
antibodies (mAb) against MERS-CoV that reduced virus replication in mice
expressing human DPP4 upon prophylactic and therapeutic treatment. Here, we
evaluated the prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of REGN3048 and REGN3051 in
the common marmoset model of MERS-CoV infection. Intravenous administration of
mAb resulted in high levels of MERS-CoV-neutralizing activity in circulating
blood. When animals were treated with mAbs one day before challenge, respiratory 
disease was less severe and, in animals treated with both REGN3048 and REGN3051, 
viral loads in the lungs were reduced. However, therapeutic treatment on day one 
after challenge was less efficacious as it did not prevent the development of
severe respiratory disease and all treated animals developed bronchointerstitial 
pneumonia of similar severity as the control animals. Thus, mAb administration
may be more effective in a prophylactic treatment regimen rather than treatment
of MERS.

Morphological characterisation of the genital organs of primates may bring
significant contributions to the understanding of different reproductive
behaviours and support new conservation strategies. However, relevant or detailed
descriptions of genital morphology of several primate species are still lacking. 
This study describes the gross and microscopic anatomy of the internal and
external genitalia of Marca's marmoset (Mico marcai). The same organs described
in other primate species were identified here, but some anatomical
particularities were detected, such as absence of a dartos tunic, presence of a
vas deferens ampulla, absence of spongious erectile tissue in the pelvic urethra,
separation of prostate gland lobes by a longitudinal sulcus and lack of septation
in the corpus cavernosus and spongiosus at the level of the shaft and free
portion of the penis. Keratinised type 1 spicules arising from epidermal or
dermal projections were found in the free portion of the penis. Microscopic
analysis revealed a small bone (baculum) consisting of peripheral compact bone
and a central, non-ossified area filled with vascular tissue at the distal end of
this portion of the penis. Results of this study may support further comparative 
studies of primates' reproductive ecology.

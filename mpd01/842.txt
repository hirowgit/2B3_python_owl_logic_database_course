Neurons that respond favorably to a particular sound level have been observed
throughout the central auditory system, becoming steadily more common at higher
processing areas. One theory about the role of these level-tuned or nonmonotonic 
neurons is the level-invariant encoding of sounds. To investigate this theory, we
simulated various subpopulations of neurons by drawing from real primary auditory
cortex (A1) neuron responses and surveyed their performance in forming different 
sound level representations. Pure nonmonotonic subpopulations did not provide the
best level-invariant decoding; instead, mixtures of monotonic and nonmonotonic
neurons provided the most accurate decoding. For level-fidelity decoding, the
inclusion of nonmonotonic neurons slightly improved or did not change decoding
accuracy until they constituted a high proportion. These results indicate that
nonmonotonic neurons fill an encoding role complementary to, rather than
alternate to, monotonic neurons.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Neurons with nonmonotonic
rate-level functions are unique to the central auditory system. These level-tuned
neurons have been proposed to account for invariant sound perception across sound
levels. Through systematic simulations based on real neuron responses, this study
shows that neuron populations perform sound encoding optimally when containing
both monotonic and nonmonotonic neurons. The results indicate that instead of
working independently, nonmonotonic neurons complement the function of monotonic 
neurons in different sound-encoding contexts.

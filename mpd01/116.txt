Impaired detection of causal relationships between actions and their outcomes can
lead to maladaptive behavior. However, causal roles of specific prefrontal cortex
(PFC) sub-regions and the caudate nucleus in mediating such relationships in
primates are unclear. We inactivated and overactivated five PFC sub-regions,
reversibly and pharmacologically: areas 24 (perigenual anterior cingulate
cortex), 32 (medial PFC), 11 (anterior orbitofrontal cortex, OFC), 14 (rostral
ventromedial PFC/medial OFC), and 14-25 (caudal ventromedial PFC) and the
anteromedial caudate to examine their role in expressing learned action-outcome
contingencies using a contingency degradation paradigm in marmoset monkeys. Area 
24 or caudate inactivation impaired the response to contingency change, while
area 11 inactivation enhanced it, and inactivation of areas 14, 32, or 14-25 had 
no effect. Overactivation of areas 11 and 24 impaired this response. These
findings demonstrate the distinct roles of PFC sub-regions in goal-directed
behavior and illuminate the candidate neurobehavioral substrates of psychiatric
disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder.

PURPOSE: The proposed method aims to create label maps that can be used for the
segmentation of animal brain MR images without the need of a brain template. This
is achieved by performing a joint deconvolution and segmentation of the brain MR 
images.
METHODS: It is based on modeling locally the image statistics using a generalized
Gaussian distribution (GGD) and couples the deconvolved image and its
corresponding labels map using the GGD-Potts model. Because of the complexity of 
the resulting Bayesian estimators of the unknown model parameters, a Gibbs
sampler is used to generate samples following the desired posterior probability.
RESULTS: The performance of the proposed algorithm is assessed on simulated and
real MR images by the segmentation of enhanced marmoset brain images into its
main compartments using the corresponding label maps created. Quantitative
assessment showed that this method presents results that are comparable to those 
obtained with the classical method-registering the volumes to a brain template.
CONCLUSION: The proposed method of using labels as prior information for brain
segmentation provides a similar or a slightly better performance compared with
the classical reference method based on a dedicated template.

A number of neurobehavioral methods have been developed to test behavior in
marmoset monkeys. These test systems are (1) the bungalow test, which quantifies 
spontaneous explorative behavior, (2) the hand-eye coordination test, which tests
a learned task of coordinated motor behavior, and (3) the fear-potentiated
startle response, which tests and quantifies pathological anxiety manifested by a
response of fright. The test systems are extensively discussed, and the value of 
these test systems is exemplified by applying them to neurological disorders to
register disease activity and drug efficacy.

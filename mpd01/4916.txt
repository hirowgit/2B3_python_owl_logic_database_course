The use of transabdominal palpation to determine the course of pregnancy in the
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).

Phillips IR, Grist SM.

Transabdominal palpation was used to determine maturity, course of pregnancy and 
post-partum changes in marmosets throughout seventy-four full-term pregnancies.
The accuracy of the technique is compared with that of other methods of studying 
the course of pregnancy in this species.

Metabolism and autoradiographic distribution of delta-8- and
delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol in some organs of the monkey Callithrix jacchus.

Just WW, Erdmann G, Thel S, Werner G, Wiechmann M.

Metabolism and autoradiographic distribution of the two isomeric
tetrahydrocannabinols, (2,4-14-C)-delta-8-THC and (2,4-14-C)-delta-9-THC, were
studied in the marmoset Callithrix jacchus. Of the two cannabinoids, delta-8-THC 
had a slower initial rate of biotransformation to the psychopharmacologically
more potent 11-hydroxylated metabolite. This may explain the minor
psychopharmacological activity of the delta-8-isomer. In glandular tissues an
accumulation of unchanged delta-9-THC was observed. Autoradiography revealed
characteristic label distributions in some organs 30 min after the administration
of the drugs. This labelling pattern was found to be changed after a 6-hr
incorporation period. The autoradiographic distribution of delta-8 and
delta-9-THC appeared to be identical.

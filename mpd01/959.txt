Primates of the genus Callithrix often obtain exudates from plants of the family 
Fabaceae. This study characterizes the chemical composition of exudates, and the 
anatomy and hystochemistry of the secretory ducts in the bark of Anadenanthera
peregrina (L.) Speg. var. peregrina (Fabaceae). Exudates from this tree species
represent an important component of the diet of hybrid marmosets, Callithrix spp.
(Primates: Cebidae). A. peregrina was selected as the focal study tree because it
is the only gum tree species exploited by Callithrix groups present within five
urban forest fragments in the municipality of Viçosa, Minas Gerais State, Brazil.
Gum samples were obtained directly from gouges made by the marmosets, while bark 
samples were obtained from A. peregrina plants, whether or not they were damaged 
by the marmosets. Constitutive secretory ducts were present in the bark of
ungouged A. peregrina, whereas, marmoset damage caused induced secretory duct
formation and an increase in the size of these ducts. The gum produced in the
gouges made by the marmosets and in ungouged plants reacted positively to tests
for polysaccharides, pectin, mucilage, and proteins. The gum from the gouges
exhibited high water (41.0%), carbohydrate (38.2%), protein (19.0%), and mineral 
(Ca 0.4% and K 0.3%) content. We argue that the relatively high calcium content
of A. peregrina gum plays an important nutritional role in, balancing a diet that
is otherwise rich in phosphorous and poor in calcium.

Brain/MINDS (Brain Mapping by Integrated Neurotechnologies for Disease Studies)
is a national brain project started by Japan in 2014. With the goal of developing
the common marmoset as a model animal for neuroscience, the project aims to build
a multiscale marmoset brain map, develop new technologies for experimentalists,
create transgenic lines for brain disease modeling, and integrate translational
findings from the clinical biomarker landscape. Brain/MINDS will collaborate with
global brain projects to share technologies and resources.

The susceptibility of common marmosets and cotton-top tamarins to infection by
HIV-2 in vivo was tested. One year and 19 months, respectively, post-inoculation,
sera taken from three of four animals from each species are reactive for HIV-2
antibodies and HIV-specific nucleotide sequences were demonstrated in short-term 
cultures of PBL from two cotton-top tamarins. The animals remain in good health.

The differentiation of spermatids in the marmoset (Callithrix jacchus, n = 9)
testis is described here at the light-microscopic level employing serial semithin
sections. The definition of 8 different phases of spermiogenesis, i.e. the
formation of spermatids, is based upon the changes in the development of nucleus,
acrosome and flagellum.

The effect of a high (chocolate) versus low fat/sugar (chow) food on a
conditioned-place-preference (CPP) task was evaluated in marmoset monkeys.
Anxiety-related behaviors and cortisol levels before and after the CPP task were 
also measured. Subjects were habituated to a two-compartment CPP box and then, on
alternate days, had access to only one compartment during daily 15-min
conditionings, for a total of 14 trials. Marmosets were provisioned with
chocolate chips in the CC-paired compartment on odd-numbered trials and standard 
chow in the CW-paired compartment on even-numbered trials. They were then tested 
for preferring the CC-paired context after a 24-h interval. During the
conditioning, a significantly greater amount (in kcal/trial) of chocolate was
consumed than chow, yet the foraging pattern of both food types was similar. On
the test trial, the time spent in the CC-paired context increased significantly
compared to pre-CPP levels, yet this response was not readily predicted by
baseline behavioral or cortisol levels. Also, the chocolate CPP response was
positively correlated with foraging time, rather than the amount of calories
consumed. The sudden absence of the food increased exploration, while the
chocolate CPP effect was associated with vigilance - both anxiety-related
behaviors in marmosets. This behavioral profile occurred regardless of any
concomitant change or correlation with cortisol. Therefore, the high fat/sugar
food was more prone to be overly consumed by the marmosets, to induce a CPP
response and to lead to anxiety-related behavior in its absence.

Common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) have become a useful animal model,
particularly for development of biopharmaceuticals. While various renal failure
models have been established in rodents, there is currently no acceptable model
in marmosets. We analyzed the damaged renal tubules and tubulointerstitial
changes (inflammation and fibrosis) of 5/6 nephrectomized (Nx) common marmosets
by histopathological/immunohistochemical methods, and compared these findings to 
those in 5/6 Nx SD rats. In Nx marmosets and rats sacrificed at 5 and 13 weeks
after Nx, variously dilated and atrophied renal tubules were seen in the cortex
in common; however, the epithelial proliferating activity was much less in Nx
marmosets. Furthermore, the degrees of inflammation and fibrosis seen in the
affected cortex were more severe and massive in Nx marmosets with time-dependent 
increase. Interestingly, inflammation in Nx marmosets, of which degree was less
in Nx rats, consisted of a large number of CD3-positive T cells and CD20-positive
B cells (occasionally forming follicles), and a few CD68-positive macrophages.
Based on these findings, lymphocytes might contribute to the progressive renal
lesions in Nx marmosets. Fibrotic areas in Nx marmosets comprised myofibroblasts 
expressing vimentin and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), whereas along with
vimentin and α-SMA expressions, desmin was expressed in myofibroblasts in Nx
rats. This study shows that there are some differences in renal lesions induced
by Nx between marmosets and rats, which would provide useful, base-line
information for pharmacology and toxicology studies using Nx marmosets.

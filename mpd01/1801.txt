Epigenetic processes have been implicated in neuronal plasticity following
repeated cocaine application. Here we measured DNA methylation at promoter CpG
sites of the dopamine transporter (DAT1) and serotonin transporter (SERT) and
neurokinin3-receptor (NK3-R)-receptor (TACR3) coding genes in marmoset monkeys
after repeated cocaine injections in a conditioned place preference paradigm. We 
found a decrease in DNA methylation at a specific CpG site in TACR3, but not DAT1
or SERT. Thus, TACR3 is a locus for DNA methylation changes in response to
repeated cocaine administration and its establishment as a reinforcer, in support
of other evidence implicating the NK3-R in reinforcement- and addiction-related
processes.

Unfamiliar environments can be a source of stress, fear and anxiety for marmoset 
monkeys. In spite of existing data, the influence of putative anxiolytics on the 
effects of novel environments has yet to be tested in primates. Therefore, the
behavior of adult black tufted-ear marmosets to a single brief (15 min) exposure 
to a novel environment was analyzed in the presence and absence of diazepam
(DZP). Marmosets were pre-treated with vehicle (n=5) or diazepam (0.5 mg/kg, ip; 
n=5) and submitted to a 15 min free exploration trial within a rectangular
open-field arena. DZP-treated subjects, compared to vehicle controls,
demonstrated significantly lower rates of (phee) contact calls and exploration,
while a higher scan duration. Sojourn time in the arena's central zone was also
significantly higher in the former group and sedation was not observed. Thus,
pre-treatment with the benzodiazepine DZP decreased several anxiety-related
behaviors induced by subjecting the marmosets to a new environment. The results
also indicate that, as with rodent subjects, the open-field may provide a useful 
simple paradigm for assessing anxiety-like behaviors in this primate and, as
such, constitutes a unique opportunity for direct comparative studies between
rodents and marmoset monkeys in terms of anxiety and/or sedation.

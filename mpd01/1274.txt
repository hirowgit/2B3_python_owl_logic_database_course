The potential proneurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)
induces Parkinson-like syndromes in common marmosets, other primates, and humans.
MPTP is metabolically activated to 1-methyl-4-phenyl-2,3-dihydropyridinium and
1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ions (MPDP(+) and MPP(+), respectively) by
desaturation reactions. MPTP is deactivated to
4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (PTP) by N-demethylation and is also
deactivated to MPTP N-oxide. The roles of cytochrome P450 (P450) enzymes and
flavin-containing monooxygenases (FMOs) in the oxidative metabolism of
MPTP-treated marmosets are not yet fully clarified. This study aimed to elucidate
P450- and FMO-dependent MPTP metabolism in marmoset liver and brain. Rates of
MPTP N-oxygenation in liver microsomes were similar to those in brain microsomes 
from 11 individual marmosets (substrate concentration, 50 μM) and were correlated
with rates of benzydamine N-oxygenation (r = 0.75, P < 0.05); the reactions were 
inhibited by methimazole (10 μM). MPTP N-oxygenation was efficiently mediated by 
recombinantly expressed marmoset FMO3. Rates of PTP formation by MPTP
N-demethylation in marmoset liver microsomes were correlated with bufuralol
1'-hydroxylation rates (r = 0.77, P < 0.01) and were suppressed by quinidine (1
μM), thereby indicating the importance of marmoset CYP2D6 in PTP formation. MPTP 
transformations to MPDP(+) and MPP(+) were efficiently catalyzed by recombinant
marmoset CYP2D6 and human CYP1A2. These results indicated the contributions of
multiple drug-metabolizing enzymes to MPTP oxidation, especially marmoset FMO3 in
deactivation (N-oxygenation) and marmoset CYP2D6 for both MPTP deactivation and
MPTP activation to MPDP(+) and MPP(+). These findings provide a foundation for
understanding MPTP metabolism and for the successful production of preclinical
marmoset models.

Oropouche virus (OROV) is a public health threat in South America, and in
particular in northern Brazil, causing frequent outbreaks of febrile illness.
Using a combination of deep sequencing and Sanger sequencing approaches, we
determined the complete genome sequences of eight clinical isolates that were
obtained from patient sera during an Oropouche fever outbreak in Amapa state,
northern Brazil, in 2009. We also report the complete genome sequences of two
OROV reassortants isolatd from two marmosets in Minas Gerais state, south-east
Brazil, in 2012 that contained a novel M genome segment. Interestingly, all 10
isolates possessed a 947 nt S segment that lacked 11 residues in the S-segment 3'
UTR compared with the recently redetermined Brazilian prototype OROV strain
BeAn19991. OROV maybe circulating more widely in Brazil and in the non-human
primate population than previously appreciated, and the identification of yet
another reassortant highlights the importance of bunyavirus surveillance in South
America.

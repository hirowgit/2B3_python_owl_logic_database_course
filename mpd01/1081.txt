BACKGROUND: Hypothalamic kisspeptin-kisspeptin receptor signalling in primates
ensures the successful progression into puberty during development and
maintenance of reproductive capacity during adulthood. Human testis has been
shown to express high-to-moderate levels of kisspeptin and kisspeptin receptor
gene expression. In this study, we aimed at characterizing the localization of
kisspeptin and kisspeptin receptor in adult primate testis tissue.
METHODS: Immunocytochemistry was performed on paraffin-embedded testicular
sections from adult rhesus monkeys and from common marmoset monkeys.
RESULTS: Kisspeptin receptor was detected in Sertoli cells in the periphery of
the seminiferous tubules in adult testes of both species. In contrast, kisspeptin
was not localized in the seminiferous epithelium and was detected only in the
interstitial compartment of the adult rhesus monkey testis.
CONCLUSION: Kisspeptin receptor and kisspeptin are localized in the testis of Old
World and New World primates.

Parasite prevalence and abundance are important factors affecting species'
conservation. During necropsies on a free-living golden-headed lion tamarin (
Leontopithecus chrysomelas ) and two Wied's marmosets ( Callithrix kuhlii ) in
the Atlantic Forest of southern Bahia, Brazil, we collected a large number of
adult intestinal parasites that we identified as Prosthenorchis elegans. This
parasite is pathogenic for neotropical primates. Prosthenorchis spp. infestation 
is influenced by diet with increased risk of exposure from ingesting invertebrate
intermediate hosts. The biological similarities and sympatric nature of these two
nonhuman primates support that they may harbor similar infectious and parasitic
agents.

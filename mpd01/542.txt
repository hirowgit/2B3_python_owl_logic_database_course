Chronic lymphocytic enteritis (CLE) is a frequent disease in common marmosets.
However, no diagnostic test for early detection of CLE is available. Mast cells
have an important role in gastrointestinal disease. The purpose of this study was
to measure fecal concentrations of N-methylhistamine (NMH), a breakdown product
of histamine metabolism, in common marmosets. A previously established NMH gas
chromatography-mass spectrometry assay for canine feces and urine was used, and
partial validation was performed. The reference intervals (n = 30) established
for fecal NMH concentrations in common marmoset were 118.2 ng/g or less for a
single fecal sample, 121.7 ng/g or less for the 3-d mean, and less than or equal 
to 167.5 ng/g for the 3-d maximum. Considerable day-to-day variation was observed
in fecal NMH concentrations; the mean %CV was 42.2% (minimum, 7.1%; maximum,
141.4%). Fecal NMH concentrations were measured in 14 marmosets for which
necropsy reports were available; 7 of the 8 marmosets with CLE and the 1 animal
with lymphoma and ulcerative enteritis had increased fecal NMH concentrations.
Increased fecal NMH concentrations may serve as a potential marker for CLE;
however, further studies exploring the role of mast cells in marmosets with CLE
are needed.

The gut microbiome is known to play a significant role in human health but its
role in aging remains unclear. The objective of this study was to compare the gut
microbiome composition between young adult and geriatric non-human primates
(marmosets) as a model of human health and disease. Stool samples were collected 
from geriatric (8+ years) and young adult males (2-5 years). Stool 16S ribosomal 
RNA V4 sequences were amplified and sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq platform.
Sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units and classified via
Mothur's Bayesian classifier referenced against the Greengenes database. A total 
of 10 young adult and 10 geriatric marmosets were included. Geriatric marmosets
had a lower mean Shannon diversity compared with young marmosets (3.15 vs. 3.46; 
p = 0.0191). Geriatric marmosets had a significantly higher mean abundance of
Proteobacteria (0.22 vs. 0.09; p = 0.0233) and lower abundance of Firmicutes
(0.15 vs. 0.19; p = 0.0032) compared with young marmosets. Geriatric marmosets
had a significantly higher abundance of Succinivibrionaceae (0.16 vs. 0.01;
p = 0.0191) and lower abundance of Porphyromonadaceae (0.07 vs. 0.11;
p = 0.0494). In summary, geriatric marmosets had significantly altered microbiome
diversity and composition compared with young adult marmosets. Further studies
are needed to test microbiome-targeted therapies to improve healthspan and
lifespan.

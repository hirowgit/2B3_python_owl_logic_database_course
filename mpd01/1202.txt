Autism is characterized by deficits in social interaction and social recognition.
Although animal models of autism have demonstrated that model animals engage less
in social interaction or attend less to conspecifics than control animals, no
animal model has yet replicated the deficit in recognition of complex social
interaction as is seen in humans with autism. Here, we show that marmosets
discriminated between human actors who reciprocated in social exchanges and those
who did not; however, marmosets with foetal exposure to valproic acid (VPA
marmosets) did not. In the reciprocal condition, two actors exchanged food
equally, while in the non-reciprocal condition, one actor (non-reciprocator)
ended up with all food and the other actor with none. After observing these
exchanges, the control marmosets avoided receiving food from the non-reciprocator
in the non-reciprocal condition. However, the VPA marmosets did not show
differential preferences in either condition, suggesting that the VPA marmosets
did not discriminate between reciprocal and non-reciprocal interactions. These
results indicate that normal marmosets can evaluate social interaction between
third-parties, while the VPA marmosets are unable to recognize whether an
individual is being reciprocal or not. This test battery can serve as a useful
tool to qualify primate models of autism.

1. Pharmacokinetics of human cytochrome P450 probes (caffeine, racemic warfarin, 
omeprazole, metoprolol and midazolam) composite, after single intravenous and
oral administrations at doses of 0.20 and 1.0 mg kg(-1), respectively, to four
male common marmosets were investigated. 2. The plasma concentrations of caffeine
and warfarin decreased slowly in a monophasic manner but those of omeprazole,
metoprolol and midazolam decreased extensively after intravenous and oral
administrations, in a manner that approximated those as reported for
pharmacokinetics in humans. 3. Bioavailabilities were ∼100% for caffeine and
warfarin, but <25% for omeprazole and metoprolol. Bioavailability of midazolam
was 4% in marmosets, presumably because of contribution of marmoset P450 3A4
expressed in small intestine and liver, with a high catalytic efficiency for
midazolam 1'-hydroxylation as evident in the recombinant system. 4. These results
suggest that common marmosets, despite their rapid clearance of some human P450
probe substrates, could be an experimental model for humans and that marmoset
P450s have functional characteristics that differ from those of human and/or
cynomolgus monkey P450s in some aspects, indicating their importance in modeling 
in P450-dependent drug metabolism studies in marmosets and of further studies.

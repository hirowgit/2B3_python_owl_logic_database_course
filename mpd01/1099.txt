1. Common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a New World Monkey, has potential to be 
a useful animal model in preclinical studies. However, drug metabolizing
properties have not been fully understood due to insufficient information on
cytochrome P450 (P450), major drug metabolizing enzymes. 2. Marmoset P450 2J2
cDNA was isolated from marmoset livers. The deduced amino acid sequence showed a 
high-sequence identity (91%) with cynomolgus monkey and human P450 2J2 enzymes. A
phylogenetic tree revealed that marmoset P450 2J2 was evolutionarily closer to
cynomolgus monkey and human P450 2J2 enzymes, than P450 2J forms in pigs,
rabbits, rats or mice. 3. Marmoset P450 2J2 mRNA was abundantly expressed in the 
small intestine and liver, and to a lesser extent in the brain, lung and kidney. 
Immunoblot analysis also showed expression of marmoset P450 2J2 protein in the
small intestine and liver. 4. Enzyme assays using marmoset P450 2J2 protein
heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli indicated that marmoset P450 2J2
effectively catalyzed astemizole O-demethylation and terfenadine t-butyl
hydroxylation, similar to human and cynomolgus monkey P450 2J2 enzymes. 5. These 
results suggest the functional characteristics of P450 2J2 enzymes are similar
among marmosets, cynomolgus monkeys and humans.

The common marmoset is a small New World primate that has attracted remarkable
attention as a potential experimental animal link between rodents and humans.
Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector-mediated expression of a disease-causing gene
or a potential therapeutic gene in the brain may allow the construction of a
marmoset model of a brain disorder or an exploration of the possibility of gene
therapy. To gain more insights into AAV vector-mediated transduction profiles in 
the marmoset central nervous system (CNS), we delivered AAV serotype 9 (AAV9)
vectors expressing GFP to the cisterna magna or the cerebellar cortex.
Intracisternally injected AAV9 vectors expanded in the CNS according to the
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow, by retrograde transport through neuronal axons or
via intermediary transcytosis, resulting in diffuse and global transduction
within the CNS. In contrast, cerebellar parenchymal injection intensely
transduced a more limited area, including the cerebellar cortex and cerebellar
afferents, such as neurons of the pontine nuclei, vestibular nucleus and inferior
olivary nucleus. In the spinal cord, both administration routes resulted in
labeling of the dorsal column and spinocerebellar tracts, presumably by
retrograde transport from the medulla oblongata and cerebellum, respectively.
Motor neurons and dorsal root ganglia were also transduced, possibly by diffusion
of the vector down the subarachnoid space along the cord. Thus, these two
administration routes led to distinct transduction patterns in the marmoset CNS, 
which could be utilized to generate different disease animal models and to
deliver therapeutic genes for the treatment of diseases affecting distinct brain 
areas.

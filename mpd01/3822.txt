Hepatitis A continues to cause sporadic cases, epidemics, and occasional deaths
in the United States. A killed virus vaccine for immunization against hepatitis A
has recently been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. One hundred
percent seroconversion occurs after a series consisting of a primary dose and a
second booster shot 6-12 months later. Co-administration of immune-globulin and
hepatitis A vaccine lowers ultimate antibody levels 50% compared with vaccine
alone. Targets for immunization will probably be children, international
travelers, military personnel, and food handlers. It will also be useful for
general vaccination in areas where smoldering epidemics occur. Natural immunity
levels in the United States population have undergone a significant decline since
1980 and are currently in the 21-33% range. Prescreening for immunity is likely
to be cost-effective in persons over age 40.

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), known to play an important role in
vascular homeostasis, vascular integrity and angiogenesis, is little known about 
the evolutionary relationship of its five members especially the role of gene
duplication and natural selection in the evolution of the VEGF family. In this
study, seventy-five full-length cDNA sequences from 33 vertebrate species were
extracted from the NCBI's GenBank, UniProt protein database and the Ensembl
database. By phylogenetic analyses, we investigated the origin, conservation, and
evolution of the VEGFs. Five VEGF family members in vertebrates might be formed
by gene duplication. The inferred evolutionary transitions that separate members 
which belong to different gene clusters correlated with changes in functional
properties. Selection analysis and protein structure analysis were combined to
explain the relationship of the site-specific evolution in the vertebrate VEGF
family. Eleven positive selection sites, one transmembrane region and the active 
sites were detected in this process.

A hallmark of human communication is vocal turn taking. Until recently, turn
taking was thought to be unique to humans but new data indicate that marmosets, a
new world monkey, take turns when vocalizing too.

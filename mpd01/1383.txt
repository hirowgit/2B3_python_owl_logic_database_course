Behavioral strategies that facilitate the maintenance of social bonds are
critical for the preservation of high-quality social relationships. Central
oxytocin (OT) activity modulates the behavioral features of socially monogamous
relationships in a number of mammalian species (including marmoset monkeys), and 
plays a vital role in the behavioral maintenance of long-term social
relationships. Two distinct variants of OT have been identified in some New World
primates (including marmosets; Lee et al., 2011). The marmoset variant of the
oxytocin ligand (Pro(8)-OT) is structurally distinct from the consensus mammalian
variant of the oxytocin ligand (Leu(8)-OT), due to a proline substitution at the 
8th amino-acid position. The goal of the present study was to determine if
treating marmosets with Pro(8)-OT, relative to treatments with Leu(8)-OT, control
saline, or an OT antagonist, had modulatory effects on the behavioral maintenance
of long-term social relationships in marmosets. Treatment with the Pro(8)
variant, but not the Leu(8) variant, of OT facilitated fidelity with a long-term 
partner by reducing time spent in close proximity with an opposite-sex stranger. 
However, this facilitative effect of Pro(8)-OT on proximity behavior manifested
itself differently in male and female marmosets, such that females preferred to
interact socially with their partner rather than a stranger when treated with
Pro(8)-OT, while males spent less time in close proximity with both their partner
and a stranger when treated with Pro(8)-OT. Furthermore, treatment with
Pro(8)-OT, but not Leu(8)-OT, significantly delayed the expression of sexual
solicitation behavior toward an opposite-sex stranger in both male and female
marmosets, but had no effect on sociosexual behavior directed toward a long-term 
partner. These results suggest that the OT system is highly involved in reducing 
fidelity-threatening behaviors in well-established marmoset pairs, and that the
effects were only produced by species-specific OT ligands.

Marmosets are cooperative breeders organized as extended family groups, but
breeding is generally restricted to a single pair. Breeding competition is fierce
in female marmosets; males, on the other hand, show low levels of intragroup
aggression. We investigated male and female breeding strategies and the resulting
reproductive output in 9 wild groups. Reproductive output, tenure of breeding
animals, identification of the breeding system, breeding position replacements,
migration and infanticide were recorded; also, we recorded grooming and
aggression. Replacement of the breeding male or female was observed on nine
occasions. On four occasions, the son of the breeding male inherited the breeding
post, but we never observed inheritance of a breeding post by a daughter. Mostly,
females attained a breeding post by immigrating to a group that had a breeding
vacancy. Our results showed that Callithrix jacchus males and females use
different strategies to attain a breeding position and maintain it for as long as
possible. These strategies prolong the tenure of the breeding position, which is 
the best way to produce a large number of offspring. This article is part of a
Special Issue entitled: Neotropical Behaviour.

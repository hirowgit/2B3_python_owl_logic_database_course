Experimental animals including the ferret, marmoset, woodchuck, mini pig, and
tree shrew have been used in biomedical research. However, their gut microbiota
have not been fully investigated. In this study, the gut microbiota of these five
experimental animals were analyzed with 16S rRNA sequencing. The phyla
Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Fusobacteria were present in the gut microbiota of
all the species. Specific phyla were present in different animals: Proteobacteria
in the ferret, Tenericutes in the marmoset, and Spirochaetes in the mini pig.
Fusobacterium and unidentified Clostridiales were the dominant genera in the
ferret, whereas Libanicoccus, Lactobacillus, Porphyromonas, and Peptoclostridium 
were specific to marmoset, mini pig, woodchuck, and tree shrew, respectively. A
clustering analysis showed that the overall distribution of microbial species in 
the guts of these species mirrored their mammalian phylogeny, and the microbiota 
of the marmoset and tree shrew showed the closest bray_curtis distances to that
of humans. PICRUSt functional prediction separated the woodchuck from the other
species, which may reflect its herbivorous diet. In conclusion, both the
evolutionary phylogeny and daily diet affect the gut microbiota of these
experimental animals, which should not be neglected for their usage in biomedical
research.

BACKGROUND: From the end of 2016 until the beginning of 2019, Brazil faced a
massive sylvatic yellow fever (YF) outbreak. The 2016-2019 YF epidemics affected 
densely populated areas, especially the Southeast region, causing thousands of
deaths of humans and non-human primates (NHP).
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We conducted a molecular investigation of yellow 
fever virus (YFV) RNA in 781 NHP carcasses collected in the urban, urban-rural
interface, and rural areas of Minas Gerais state, from January 2017 to December
2018. Samples were analyzed according to the period of sampling, NHP genera,
sampling areas, and sampling areas/NHP genera to compare the proportions of
YFV-positive carcasses and the estimated YFV genomic loads. YFV infection was
confirmed in 38.1% of NHP carcasses (including specimens of the genera Alouatta, 
Callicebus, Callithrix, and Sapajus), from the urban, urban-rural interface, and 
rural areas. YFV RNA detection was positively associated with epidemic periods
(especially from December to March) and the rural environment. Higher median
viral genomic loads (one million times) were estimated in carcasses collected in 
rural areas compared to urban ones.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The results showed the wide occurrence of YF in Minas
Gerais in epidemic and non-epidemic periods. According to the sylvatic pattern of
YF, a gradient of viral dissemination from rural towards urban areas was
observed. A high YF positivity was observed for NHP carcasses collected in urban 
areas with a widespread occurrence in 67 municipalities of Minas Gerais,
including large urban centers. Although there was no documented case of
urban/Aedes YFV transmission to humans in Brazil during the 2016-2019 outbreaks, 
YFV-infected NHP in urban areas with high infestation by Aedes aegypti poses
risks for YFV urban/Aedes transmission and urbanization.

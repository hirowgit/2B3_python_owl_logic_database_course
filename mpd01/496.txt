Whole metagenome shotgun (WMGS) sequencing is a method that provides insights
into the genomic composition and arrangement of complex microbial consortia.
Here, we report how WMGS coupled with a cultivation approach allows the isolation
of novel bifidobacteria from animal fecal samples. A combination of in silico
analyses based on nucleotide and protein sequences facilitate the identification 
of genetic material belonging to putative novel species. Consequently, the
prediction of metabolic properties by in silico analyses permits the
identification of specific substrates that are then employed to isolate these
species through a cultivation method.

As a primate animal model for neuroscience research, the common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus) provides an unprecedented opportunity to gain a better
understanding of the human brain function and pathophysiology of neurological and
psychiatric disorders, thereby helping in the diagnosis and treatment of those
disorders. The marmoset is particularly useful in studying the neural mechanisms 
underlying social behavior, as their prosocial behavior and visual and vocal
communication systems are well-developed. Despite recent advances in
biotechnology such as the creation of genetically engineered marmosets, our
understanding of the marmoset brain, including its dysfunction in disease, at the
circuit level remains limited due to the lack of comprehensive knowledge of the
neuronal connections in the marmoset brain. Here we describe the development of
genetic and viral engineering techniques for a particular type of neuron in
non-transgenic animals. These approaches, combined with rabies viral tracing,
imaging, and electrophysiology, will make it possible to map the connectome and
relate neuronal connectivity to function in the marmoset brain. Such
circuit-level studies will open a new avenue for non-human primate research that 
can bridge the gap between basic research and human studies.

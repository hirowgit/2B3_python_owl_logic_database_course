Movement dysfunction in Parkinson's disease (PD) is caused by the degeneration of
dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra (SN). Here, we established a
method for voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and automatic tissue segmentation of the
marmoset monkey brain using a 7-T animal scanner and applied the method to assess
DA degeneration in a PD model, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine
(MPTP)-treated animals, with tyrosine-hydroxylase staining. The most significant 
decreases of local tissue volume were detected in the bilateral SN of
MPTP-treated marmoset brains (-53.0% in right and -46.5% in left) and
corresponded with the location of DA neurodegeneration found in histology (-65.4%
in right). In addition to the SN, the decreases were also confirmed in the locus 
coeruleus, and lateral hypothalamus. VBM using 7-T MRI was effective in detecting
volume loss in the SN of the PD-model marmoset. This study provides a potential
basis for the application of VBM with ultra-high field MRI in the clinical
diagnosis of PD. The developed method may also offer value in automatic
whole-brain evaluation of structural changes for the marmoset monkey.

INTRODUCTION: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an enigmatic autoimmune-driven
inflammatory/demyelinating disease of the human central nervous system (CNS),
affecting brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves. The cause of the disease is not
known and the number of effective treatments is limited. Despite some clear
successes, translation of immunological discoveries in the mouse experimental
autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model into effective therapies for MS patients
has been difficult. This translation gap between MS and its elected EAE animal
model reflects the phylogenetic distance between humans and their experimental
counterpart, the inbred/specific pathogen free (SPF) laboratory mouse.
OBJECTIVE: Here, we discuss that important new insights can be obtained into the 
mechanistic basis of the therapy paradox from the study of nonhuman primate EAE
(NHP-EAE) models, the well-validated EAE model in common marmosets (Callithrix
jacchus) in particular.
INTERPRETATION: Data presented in this review demonstrate that due to a
considerable immunological and pathological overlap with mouse EAE on one side
and MS on the other, the NHP EAE model can help us bridge the translation gap.

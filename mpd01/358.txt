Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) G2019S is a relatively common mutation,
associated with 1-3% of Parkinson's disease (PD) cases worldwide. G2019S is
hypothesized to increase LRRK2 kinase activity. Dopaminergic neurons derived from
induced pluripotent stem cells of PD patients carrying LRRK2 G2019S are reported 
to have several phenotypes compared to wild type controls, including increased
activated caspase-3 and reactive oxygen species (ROS), autophagy dysfunction, and
simplification of neurites. The common marmoset is envisioned as a candidate
nonhuman primate species for comprehensive modeling of genetic mutations. Here,
we report our successful use of CRISPR/Cas9 with repair template-mediated
homology directed repair to introduce the LRRK2 G2019S mutation, as well as a
truncation of the LRRK2 kinase domain, into marmoset embryonic and induced
pluripotent stem cells. We found that, similar to humans, marmoset LRRK2 G2019S
resulted in elevated kinase activity. Phenotypic evaluation after dopaminergic
differentiation demonstrated LRRK2 G2019S-mediated increased intracellular ROS,
decreased neuronal viability, and reduced neurite complexity. Importantly, these 
phenotypes were not observed in clones with LRRK2 truncation. These results
demonstrate the feasibility of inducing monogenic mutations in common marmosets
and support the use of this species for generating a novel genetic-based model of
PD that expresses physiological levels of LRRK2 G2019S.

BACKGROUND: Yellow fever (YF) is a severe, infectious, but non-communicable
arboviral hemorrhagic disease. In the last decades, yellow fever virus (YFV)
infections have been prevalent in endemic areas in Brazil, affecting human and
non-human primate (NHP) populations. Monitoring of NHP infection started in 1999,
and reports of epizootic diseases are considered important indicators of viral
transmission, particularly in relation to the sylvatic cycle. This study presents
the monitoring of YFV by real-time RT-PCR and the epidemiological findings
related to the deaths of NHPs in the south-eastern states and in the
north-eastern state of Bahia, during the outbreak of YF in Brazil during 2017 and
2018.
METHODS: A total of 4198 samples from 2099 NHPs from south-eastern and
north-eastern Brazilian states were analyzed by real-time reverse transcription
polymerase chain reaction (rtRT-PCR).
RESULTS: A total of 4198 samples from 2099 NHPs from south-eastern and
north-eastern Brazilian states were collected between 2017 and 2018. The samples 
were subjected to molecular diagnostics for YFV detection using real-time reverse
transcription polymerase chain reaction (rtRT-PCR) techniques. Epizootics were
coincident with human YF cases. Furthermore, our results showed that the YF
frequency was higher among marmosets (Callithrix sp.) than in previous reports.
Viremia in species of the genus Alouatta and Callithrix differed greatly.
DISCUSSION: Our results indicate a need for further investigation of the role of 
Callithrix spp. in the transmission cycles of YFV in Brazil. In particular, YFV
transmission was observed in a region where viral circulation has not been
recorded for decades and thus vaccination has not been previously recommended.
CONCLUSIONS: This highlights the need to straighten epizootic surveillance and
evaluate the extent of vaccination programmes in Brazil in previously considered 
"YFV-free" areas of the country.

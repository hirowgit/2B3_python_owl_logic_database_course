South American Zika virus (ZIKV) recently emerged as a novel human pathogen,
linked with neurological disorders. However, comparative ZIKV infectivity studies
in New World primates are lacking. Two members of the Callitrichidae family,
common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) and red-bellied tamarins (Saguinus
labiatus), were highly susceptible to sub-cutaneous challenge with the Puerto
Rico-origin ZIKVPRVABC59 strain. Both exhibited rapid, high, acute viraemia with 
early neuroinvasion (3 days) in peripheral and central nervous tissue. ZIKV RNA
levels in blood and tissues were significantly higher in New World hosts compared
to Old World species (Macaca mulatta, Macaca fascicularis). Tamarins and rhesus
macaques exhibited loss of zonal occludens-1 (ZO-1) staining, indicative of a
compromised blood-brain barrier 3 days post-ZIKV exposure. Early, widespread
dissemination across multiple anatomical sites distant to the inoculation site
preceded extensive ZIKV persistence after 100 days in New and Old World lineages,
especially lymphoid, neurological and reproductive sites. Prolonged persistence
in brain tissue has implications for otherwise resolved human ZIKV infection.
High susceptibility of distinct New World species underscores possible
establishment of ZIKV sylvatic cycles in primates indigenous to ZIKV endemic
regions. Tamarins and marmosets represent viable New World models for ZIKV
pathogenesis and therapeutic intervention studies, including vaccines, with
contemporary strains.

Across vertebrates, progressive changes in vocal behavior during postnatal
development are typically attributed solely to developing neural circuits. How
the changing body influences vocal development remains unknown. Here we show that
state changes in the contact vocalizations of infant marmoset monkeys, which
transition from noisy, low frequency cries to tonal, higher pitched vocalizations
in adults, are caused partially by laryngeal development. Combining analyses of
natural vocalizations, motorized excised larynx experiments, tensile material
tests and high-speed imaging, we show that vocal state transition occurs via a
sound source switch from vocal folds to apical vocal membranes, producing louder 
vocalizations with higher efficiency. We show with an empiricallyÂ based model of 
descending motor control how neural circuits could interact with changing
laryngeal dynamics, leading to adaptive vocal development. Our results emphasize 
the importance of embodied approaches to vocal development, where exploiting
biomechanical consequences of changing material properties can simplify motor
control, reducing the computational load on the developing brain.

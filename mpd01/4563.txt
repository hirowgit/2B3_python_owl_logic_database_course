Chromation at low temperatures improves impregnation of neurons in Golgi-aldehyde
methods.

Erratum in
    J Neurosci Methods 1987 Apr;19(4):347.

A modification of the Golgi-aldehyde methods is proposed in which the tissue is
maintained at 4 degrees C during chromation. This prevents precipitation of the
solution, and significantly improves the quality of the Golgi stain, probably
owing to better fixation of the tissue.

Herpesvirus saimiri strain 11 immortalizes a restricted marmoset T8 lymphocyte
subpopulation in vitro.

Kiyotaki M, Desrosiers RC, Letvin NL.

Herpesvirus saimiri induces a fatal lymphoproliferative syndrome in a variety of 
New World primate species. We now show that cell lines derived from PBL of the
common marmoset by in vitro-immortalization with H. saimiri strain 11 represent a
remarkably restricted lymphocyte population. These cell lines have NK cell
function, phenotypically express both suppressor/cytotoxic (T8) and NK cell
(NKH1)-associated antigens, and express a T cell receptor. This subpopulation of 
lymphocytes is a very minor population of cells in the peripheral blood of common
marmosets (less than or equal to 3%). The specificity in the interaction between 
H. saimiri strain 11 and a subpopulation of common marmoset lymphocytes
represents an example of a restricted viral lymphotropism and may have important 
implications for the disease induced by this virus in New World monkeys.

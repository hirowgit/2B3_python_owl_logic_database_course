The entorhinal cortex (EC) is associated with impaired cognitive function such as
in the case of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease.
The present study provides a detailed analysis of the cytoarchitectural and
myeloarchitectural organization of the EC in the common marmoset Callithrix
jacchus. Data were collected using Nissl and fiber stained preparations,
supplemented with acetylcholinesterase and parvalbumin immunohistochemistry. The 
EC layers and subfields in the marmoset seem to be architectonically similar to
those that have been proposed in nonhuman primates and humans to date; however,
slight differences could be revealed using the present techniques. Throughout its
rostrocaudal length, the entorhinal cortex presents a clear six-layered pattern. 
The entorhinal cortex is divided into six fields, named mainly in accordance to
their rostrocaudal and mediolateral positions. At rostral levels, the neurons
tend to be organized in patches that are surrounded by large, thick, radially
oriented bundles of fibers, and the deep layers are poorly developed. At caudal
levels, the divisions are more laminated in appearance. AChE staining at the
borders of adjacent fields are consistent with the changes in layering revealed
in Nissl-stained sections, of which the lateral regions of the EC display denser 
AChE staining than that of the medial banks. PV immunoreactivity was found in the
labeled somata, dendrites, and axons in all layers and subdivisions.
Additionally, we distinguished three subtypes of PV-immunoreactive neurons:
multipolar, bipolar and spherical-shaped neurons, based on the shape of the
somata and the disposition of the dendrites.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a New World monkey that has attracted
much attention as a potentially useful primate model for preclinical testing. A
total of 36 marmoset cytochrome P450 (P450) isoforms in the P450 1-51 subfamilies
have been identified and characterized by the application of genome analysis and 
molecular functional characterization. In this mini-review, we provide an
overview of the genomic structures, sequence identities, and substrate
selectivities of marmoset P450s compared with those of human P450s. Based on the 
sequence identity, phylogeny, and genomic organization of marmoset P450s,
orthologous relationships were established between human and marmoset P450s.
Twenty-four members of the marmoset P450 1A, 2A, 2B, 2C, 2D, 2E, 3A, 4A, and 4F
subfamilies shared high degrees of homology in terms of cDNA (>89%) and amino
acid sequences (>85%) with the corresponding human P450s; P450 2C76 was among the
exceptions. Phylogenetic analysis using amino acid sequences revealed that
marmoset P450s in the P450 1-51 families were located in the same clades as their
human and macaque P450 homologs. This finding underlines the evolutionary
closeness of marmoset P450s to their human and macaque homologs. Most marmoset
P450 1-4 enzymes catalyzed the typical drug-metabolizing reactions of the
corresponding human P450 homologs, except for some differences of P450 2A6 and
2B6. Consequently, it appears that the substrate specificities of enzymes in the 
P450 1-4 families are generally similar in marmosets and humans. The information 
presented here supports a better understanding of the functional characteristics 
of marmoset P450s and their similarities and differences with human P450s. It is 
hoped that this mini-review will facilitate the successful use of marmosets as
primate models in drug metabolism and pharmacokinetic studies.

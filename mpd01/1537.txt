The experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE) model is used for preclinical
research into the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS), mostly in inbred,
specific pathogen free (SPF)-raised laboratory mice. However, the naive state of 
the laboratory mouse immune system is considered a major hurdle in the
translation of principles from the EAE model to the MS patient. Non-human
primates (NHP) have an immune system harboring T- and B-cell memory against
environmental antigens, similar as in humans. We sought to further refine
existing NHP EAE models, which may help to bridge the gab between mouse EAE
models and MS. We report here on new EAE models in three NHP species: rhesus
monkeys (Macaca mulatta), cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) and common
marmosets (Callithrix jacchus). EAE was induced with recombinant human myelin
oligodendrocyte glycoprotein extracellular domain (1-125) (rhMOG) formulated in
incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA). IFA lacks the bacterial antigens that are
present in complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA), which are notorious for the
induction of discomforting side effects. Clinically evident EAE could be induced 
in two out of five rhesus monkeys, six out of six cynomolgus monkeys and six out 
of six common marmosets. In each of these species, the presence of an early, high
anti-rhMOG IgM response is correlated with EAE with an earlier onset and more
severe disease course. Animals without an early high IgM response either did not 
develop disease (rhesus monkeys) or developed only mild signs of neurological
deficit (marmoset and cynomolgus monkeys).

The stability of mRNA and its translation is a vital process necessary for proper
protein production. The specificity of the regulation is controlled by specific
RNA motifs and regulatory proteins. Pumilio/fem-3 mRNA-binding factor (PUF)
proteins are usually used in regulating mRNA stability as well as translation.
Here, we optimized a PUF protein target finder program to understand the natural 
diversity of RNA recognition by this family of proteins. ExonSuite is available
to compile and run at https://github.com/dilanustek/ExonSuite.

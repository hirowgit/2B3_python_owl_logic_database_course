The absence of pathological hallmarks of progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) in
commonly used rodent models of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE)
hinders the development of adequate treatments for progressive disease. Work
reviewed here shows that such hallmarks are present in the EAE model in marmoset 
monkeys (Callithrix jacchus). The minimal requirement for induction of
progressive MS pathology is immunization with a synthetic peptide representing
residues 34-56 from human myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) formulated
with a mineral oil [incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA)]. Pathological aspects
include demyelination of cortical gray matter with microglia activation,
oxidative stress, and redistribution of iron. When the peptide is formulated in
complete Freund's adjuvant, which contains mycobacteria that relay strong
activation signals to myeloid cells, oxidative damage pathways are strongly
boosted leading to more intensive pathology. The proven absence of immune
potentiating danger signals in the MOG34-56/IFA formulation implies that a narrow
population of antigen-experienced T cells present in the monkey's immune
repertoire is activated. This novel pathway involves the interplay of
lymphocryptovirus-infected B cells with MHC class Ib/Caja-E restricted CD8+ CD56+
cytotoxic T lymphocytes.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder
producing a variety of motor and cognitive deficits with the causes remaining
largely unknown. The gradual loss of the nigrostriatal pathway is currently
considered the pivotal pathological event. To better understand the progression
of PD and improve treatment management, defining the disease on a structural
basis and expanding brain analysis to extra-nigral structures is indispensable.
The anatomical complexity and the presence of neuromelanin, make the use of
non-human primates an essential element in developing putative imaging biomarkers
of PD. To this end, ex vivo T2-weighted magnetic resonance images were acquired
from control and 1-methyl-4 phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated
marmosets. Volume measurements of the caudate, putamen, and substantia nigra
indicated significant atrophy and cortical thinning. Tensor-based morphometry
provided a more extensive and hypothesis free assessment of widespread changes
caused by the toxin insult to the brain, especially highlighting regional
cortical atrophy. The results highlight the importance of developing imaging
biomarkers of PD in non-human primate models considering their distinct
neuroanatomy. It is essential to further develop these biomarkers in vivo to
provide non-invasive tools to detect pre-symptomatic PD and to monitor potential 
disease altering therapeutics.

Inflammatory destruction of iron-rich myelin is characteristic of multiple
sclerosis (MS). Although iron is needed for oligodendrocytes to produce myelin
during development, its deposition has also been linked to neurodegeneration and 
inflammation, including in MS. We report perivascular iron deposition in multiple
sclerosis lesions that was mirrored in 72 lesions from 13 marmosets with
experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Iron accumulated mainly inside
microglia/macrophages from 6 weeks after demyelination. Consistently, expression 
of transferrin receptor, the brain's main iron-influx protein, increased as
lesions aged. Iron was uncorrelated with inflammation and postdated initial
demyelination, suggesting that iron is not directly pathogenic. Iron homeostasis 
was at least partially restored in remyelinated, but not persistently
demyelinated, lesions. Taken together, our results suggest that iron accumulation
in the weeks after inflammatory demyelination may contribute to lesion repair
rather than inflammatory demyelination per se.

Metformin has beneficial effects on several age-related diseases (e.g., diabetes,
obesity, cancer) and extends lifespan in nematodes and mice. Acarbose, an
FDA-approved agent for treating type 2 diabetes, prevents breakdown of complex
carbohydrates. Both compounds have been suggested as potential anti-aging
interventions and acarbose has been shown to extend mouse longevity by the
Intervention Testing Program (ITP). One potential next step is to assess the
effect of these interventions on healthspan and lifespan in non-human primates.
The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a small new world monkey with a
relatively short life span and small size, both valuable for the translation
potential of this nonhuman primate species for the study of aging and chronic
disease. However, the dosing and assessment of potential side effects of either
metformin or acarbose in this species have yet to be assessed. This study
evaluated the pharmacokinetics of two dosage levels each of metformin or acarbose
(given separately) in two small groups of young marmosets (n = 5/group) treated
for 24 h to define the pharmacokinetics of each drug. The ability to rapidly and 
reliably dose socially housed marmosets with an oral form of acarbose or
metformin that is well tolerated indicates that this species is a reliable model 
for testing acarbose and metformin in a safe and efficient way in a long-term
intervention.

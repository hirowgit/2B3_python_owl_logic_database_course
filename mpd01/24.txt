Physiologic changes during development, aging, and pregnancy may affect clinical 
parameters. Previously available reference values have been based on samples that
may include wild and captive marmosets, with little representation of geriatric
or pregnant animals. Establishing reference values under various conditions would
support better recognition of pathologic conditions in marmosets. One hundred and
forty-seven (70 males and 77 females) healthy marmosets from a research colony
were included in this study. Exclusion criteria were abnormal physical exam
findings at the time of blood sampling, chronic medications, or clinical or
pathologic evidence of disease. Reference intervals were calculated for serum
chemistry and hematology. Using metadata, samples were classified based on age,
sex, colony source and pregnancy status. Multiple tests indicated significant
differences with varying effect sizes, indicating that developing reference
intervals based on metadata can be useful. Across all the comparisons, medium or 
large effect sizes were observed most frequently in blood urea nitrogen (BUN),
calcium, total protein, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), weight and serum albumin. We 
report normative clinical pathologic data for captive common marmosets through
all life stages and reproductive status. Significant differences were observed in
most parameters when stratifying data based on age, sex, colony source, or
pregnancy, suggesting that developing reference intervals considering this
information is important for clinicians.

PURPOSE: Leishmaniasis are infectious and zoonotic diseases and present in
cutaneous and visceral forms. Cutaneous leishmaniasis is endemic and widely
distributed throughout the state of Espírito Santo, Brazil. Several cases of
cutaneous leishmaniasis in humans and dogs associated with Leishmania (Viannia)
braziliensis have been reported in the state. This study aimed to investigate the
occurrence of natural infection by Leishmania(Viannia) braziliensis in wild
mammals found dead (by trampling or natural death) in the Sooretama Biological
Reserve, Espírito Santo State.
METHODS: From January 2018 to December 2019, 60 animals were collected. Of these,
47 animals from 12 different species were analyzed. The results were demonstrated
using descriptive analysis of the observations to calculate the absolute and
relative frequencies of the data.
RESULTS: In the PCR, using specific primers for the genus Leishmania (D1, D2, and
D3) and the species Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis (ISVB/ISVC), 4 positive
animals (8.5%) were detected: 1 Cuniculus paca (paca) (25%) and 3 Callithrix
geoffroyi (white-faced marmoset) (25%). In the histopathological analysis, the
parasitic amastigote form was not observed.
CONCLUSIONS: The natural infection, detected by PCR, by Leishmania (Viannia)
braziliensis in Cuniculus paca (paca) and Callithrix geoffroyi (white-faced
marmoset) constitutes the first report of infection of this rodent and primate
species in the literature. Despite the confirmation of Leishmania (Viannia)
braziliensis infection in rodents and primates, the role of these species in the 
transmission of this zoonosis still needs further observational studies to
identify their seasonal variation, transmissibility, infection stability, and the
effects of a given parasite on the population and/or individual.

Squalestatin analogues modified in the C1 side chain were prepared and evaluated 
for their ability to inhibit rat liver microsomal and Candida squalene synthase
(SQS) in vitro. While maintaining the 4,6-dimethyloctenoate or
4,6-dimethyloctanoate ester groups at C6, a number of modifications to the C1
side chain were well tolerated. However, in the absence of the C6 ester group,
similar modifications to the C1 side chain caused substantial loss of activity.
Compounds were also evaluated for their ability to inhibit cholesterol
biosynthesis in vivo in rats and to reduce serum cholesterol levels in marmosets.
These studies revealed that compounds with similar SQS inhibitory activities can 
possess different in vivo durations of action and lipid-lowering abilities.

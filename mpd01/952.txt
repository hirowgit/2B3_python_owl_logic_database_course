The study of local ecological knowledge (LEK) fosters a better understanding of
the relationship between humans and the environment. We assessed respondents'
ecological knowledge of primates in a rural community located near the Atlantic
Forest remnants in the state of Paraíba, Brazil. Populations of Alouatta belzebul
(red-handed howler monkeys), Sapajus flavius (blonde capuchins), and Callithrix
jacchus (the common marmoset) inhabit the region. We conducted 200
semi-structured interviews and applied thematic content analysis, with weighting,
to the responses to quantify the LEK. Respondents showed a low LEK, despite the
community's proximity to forest remnants. However, the LEK was significantly
higher among men, as well as among those who had a greater degree of contact with
the primates. Age did not influence LEK. The studied community apparently does
not intensively exploit the forest resources nor does it economically depend on
primates, which may explain these individuals' low levels of knowledge about
these animals. Such data may support future studies, as well as environmental
education and action plans, especially for A. belzebul and S. flavius, both of
which are endangered species and targets of the National Action Plan for the
Conservation of the Primates of the Northeast.

BACKGROUND: Common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) and cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca 
fascicularis) are used as non-human primate models in preclinical studies for
drug development.
OBJECTIVE: The assessment of P450 induction in hepatocytes from marmosets and
cynomolgus monkeys was performed using typical P450 inducers.
METHODS: Induction of cytochrome P450 1-4 family enzymes was analyzed in two lots
of cultured hepatocytes from common marmosets and cynomolgus monkeys after 24-h
treatment with typical human P450 inducing agents by real-time reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction.
RESULTS: Marmoset P450 3A4 mRNA and P450 2C8/2C19 mRNA in hepatocytes were
strongly (>10- fold) and weakly (>2) induced by rifampicin, respectively.
Marmoset 1A1 and 1A2 mRNA were induced strongly (>200-fold) by β-naphthoflavone
and omeprazole. Marmoset P450 2B6 mRNA was induced (~5-fold) by a constitutive
androstane receptor agonist, but not by phenobarbital. Cynomolgus monkey P450 3A4
mRNA and P450 1A1 mRNA in cultured hepatocytes were also induced by rifampicin
and omeprazole, respectively, but P450 2B6 mRNA was not induced by phenobarbital.
CONCLUSION: These results indicate that P450 1A/3A induction by typical human
P450 inducers in hepatocytes from marmosets and/or cynomolgus monkeys are similar
to those of humans (except for P450 2B induction by phenobarbital in humans),
suggesting that marmosets and cynomolgus monkeys might be suitable models for
evaluating the drug interactions in preclinical studies.

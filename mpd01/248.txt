Nonhuman primates (NHPs) are an essential research model for gaining a
comprehensive understanding of the neural mechanisms of neurocognitive aging in
our own species. In the present study, we used resting state functional
connectivity (rsFC) to investigate the relationship between prefrontal cortical
and striatal neural interactions, and cognitive flexibility, in unanaesthetized
common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) at two time points during late middle age
(8 months apart, similar to a span of 5-6 years in humans). Based on our previous
findings, we also determine the reproducibility of connectivity measures over the
course of 8 months, particularly previously observed sex differences in rsFC.
Male marmosets exhibited remarkably similar patterns of stronger functional
connectivity relative to females and greater cognitive flexibility between the
two imaging time points. Network analysis revealed that the consistent sex
differences in connectivity and related cognitive associations were characterized
by greater node strength and/or degree values in several prefrontal, premotor and
temporal regions, as well as stronger intra PFC connectivity, in males compared
to females. The current study supports the existence of robust sex differences in
prefrontal and striatal resting state networks that may contribute to differences
in cognitive function and offers insight on the neural systems that may be
compromised in cognitive aging and age-related conditions such as mild cognitive 
impairment and Alzheimer's disease.

Experimental animals including the ferret, marmoset, woodchuck, mini pig, and
tree shrew have been used in biomedical research. However, their gut microbiota
have not been fully investigated. In this study, the gut microbiota of these five
experimental animals were analyzed with 16S rRNA sequencing. The phyla
Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Fusobacteria were present in the gut microbiota of
all the species. Specific phyla were present in different animals: Proteobacteria
in the ferret, Tenericutes in the marmoset, and Spirochaetes in the mini pig.
Fusobacterium and unidentified Clostridiales were the dominant genera in the
ferret, whereas Libanicoccus, Lactobacillus, Porphyromonas, and Peptoclostridium 
were specific to marmoset, mini pig, woodchuck, and tree shrew, respectively. A
clustering analysis showed that the overall distribution of microbial species in 
the guts of these species mirrored their mammalian phylogeny, and the microbiota 
of the marmoset and tree shrew showed the closest bray_curtis distances to that
of humans. PICRUSt functional prediction separated the woodchuck from the other
species, which may reflect its herbivorous diet. In conclusion, both the
evolutionary phylogeny and daily diet affect the gut microbiota of these
experimental animals, which should not be neglected for their usage in biomedical
research.

Bioluminescence is a natural light source based on luciferase catalysis of its
substrate luciferin. We performed directed evolution on firefly luciferase using 
a red-shifted and highly deliverable luciferin analog to establish AkaBLI, an
all-engineered bioluminescence in vivo imaging system. AkaBLI produced emissions 
in vivo that were brighter by a factor of 100 to 1000 than conventional systems, 
allowing noninvasive visualization of single cells deep inside freely moving
animals. Single tumorigenic cells trapped in the mouse lung vasculature could be 
visualized. In the mouse brain, genetic labeling with neural activity sensors
allowed tracking of small clusters of hippocampal neurons activated by novel
environments. In a marmoset, we recorded video-rate bioluminescence from neurons 
in the striatum, a deep brain area, for more than 1 year. AkaBLI is therefore a
bioengineered light source to spur unprecedented scientific, medical, and
industrial applications.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a nonhuman primate that is used for
preclinical research on stem cell transplantation therapies due to its similarity
to human beings as well as its small size, enabling researchers to perform
experiments without preparing a large number of cells. In this study, we
developed a marmoset hepatic fibrosis model for regenerative medicine research.
Six female marmosets aged 4-6 years were administered thioacetamide (TAA) at a
dose of 2.5-40 mg/kg two or three times a week. Hepatic fibrosis was assessed by 
liver biopsy when blood chemistry indicated liver damage. Administration of TAA
increased total bile acid, aspartate aminotransferase, and total bilirubin and
decreased serum albumin levels. Following more than 11 weeks of continuous
injection of TAA, histological analyses detected hepatic fibrosis in all animals.
Type IV collagen 7S serum levels in animals with hepatic fibrosis were
significantly higher than in normal animals as a possible marker of hepatic
fibrosis in marmosets. Serial liver biopsies following the last administration of
TAA revealed that induced fibrosis remained up to 11 weeks. The results suggest
that continuous TAA administration induces persistent hepatic fibrosis in the
common marmoset and this nonhuman primate hepatic fibrosis model have the
possibility to evaluate the therapeutic effects of test samples to ameliorate
hepatic fibrosis.

Sensory perception depends on neuronal populations creating an accurate
representation of the external world. The amount of information that a population
can represent depends on the tuning of individual neurons and the trial-by-trial 
variability shared among neurons. Although on average, pairwise spike-count
correlations between neurons are positive, the distribution is wide, and the
relationship between correlations and encoding is not straightforward. Here, we
examine how single-neuron and population-level factors impact the efficacy of the
neural code. We recorded responses to moving visual stimuli from motion-sensitive
neurons in the middle temporal area of anesthetized marmosets (Callithrix
jacchus) and trained decoders to assess how correlated and uncorrelated
populations encoded stimulus motion direction. We found that the most responsive,
direction-selective, and least variable neurons are the most relied-upon neurons 
in an uncorrelated population. In correlated populations, the same neurons do the
most to shape the shared variability across the population in a way that
facilitates decoding, and decoding is improved by the presence of temporally
stable correlations. This suggests that the least variable neurons with the
strongest stimulus representations enhance the population code by providing a
strong signal and shaping correlations in variability orthogonally to the locus
defined by the mean response.

In our previous study based on hsp60 PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism
and 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we stated that the bifidobacterial strains isolated
from the individual faecal samples of five baby common marmosets constituted
different phylogenetically isolated groups of the genus Bifidobacterium. In that 
study, we also proposed that these isolated groups potentially represented novel 
species of the genus Bifidobacterium. Out of them, Bifidobacterium aesculapii,
Bifidobacterium myosotis, Bifidobacterium tissieri and Bifidobacterium hapali,
have been described recently. Another strain, designated MRM 8.19T, has been
classified as member of the genus Bifidobacterium on the basis of positive
results for fructose-6-phosphate phosphoketolase activity and analysis of partial
16S rRNA, hsp60, clpC, dnaJ, dnaG and rpoB gene sequences. Analysis of 16S rRNA
and hsp60 gene sequences revealed that strain MRM 8.19T was related to B.
tissieri DSM 100201T (95.8 %) and to Bifidobacterium bifidum ATCC 29521T
(93.7 %), respectively. The DNA G+C composition was 63.7 mol% and the
peptidoglycan structure was l-Orn(Lys)-l-Ser. Based on the phylogenetic,
genotypic and phenotypic data reported, strain MRM 8.19T represents a novel taxon
within the genus Bifidobacterium for which the name Bifidobacterium catulorum sp.
nov. (type strain MRM 8.19T=DSM 103154T=JCM 31794T) is proposed.

Cisplatin is a chemotherapeutic agent whose use is limited by side effects
including neuropathies. In proliferating cells, toxic action of cisplatin is
based on DNA interactions, while, in quiescent cells, it can induce apoptosis by 
interacting with proteins. In the present study, we compared cytotoxic mechanisms
activated by cisplatin in primate and rodent neurons and in ovary cells in order 
to determine whether the anti-apoptotic peptide PACAP could selectively reduce
neurotoxicity. In quiescent neurons, JNK and sphingomyelinase inhibitors blocked 
cisplatin-induced cell death. Toxicity was associated with DNA laddering,
caspase-3 and -9 activations and Bax induction. These effects were prevented by
PACAP. In proliferating cells, cisplatin activated caspase-8 but had no effect on
caspase-9. PACAP exerted no protective effect. These data indicate that cisplatin
activates distinct apoptotic pathways in quiescent neurons and proliferating
cells and that PACAP may reduce neurotoxicity of cisplatin without affecting its 
chemotherapeutic efficacy.

BACKGROUND: Sperm-derived mitochondria are integrated into the oocyte at
fertilization but seem to vanish during the early cleavage phase. The
developmental potential of pre-implantation embryos seems to be closely related
to their ability to induce degeneration of these mitochondria, but the mechanisms
underlying their loss of function are not yet understood. This study focuses on
the fate of paternal mitochondria in pre-implantation embryos.
METHODS: Stimulation, collection and in vitro culture of oocytes from Callithrix 
jacchus, allows the study of the destiny of paternal mitochondria by utilizing
immunostaining of pre-implantation embryos, fluorescence and laserscanning
microscopy. Live pre-implantation embryos were stained with a fluorescence
indicator reflecting mitochondrial membrane potential.
RESULTS: Evidence indicating the loss of mitochondrial function was not found nor
that apoptosis pathways were involved in the disappearance of paternally derived 
mitochondria.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings may have implications for mitochondrially inherited
diseases and could lead to new strategies for improving assisted reproduction.

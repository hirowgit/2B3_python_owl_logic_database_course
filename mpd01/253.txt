Yellow Fever (YF) is a severe disease caused by Yellow Fever Virus (YFV), endemic
in some parts of Africa and America. In Brazil, YFV is maintained by a sylvatic
transmission cycle involving non-human primates (NHP) and forest canopy-dwelling 
mosquitoes, mainly Haemagogus-spp and Sabethes-spp. Beginning in 2016, Brazil
faced one of the largest Yellow Fever (YF) outbreaks in recent decades, mainly in
the southeastern region. In São Paulo city, YFV was detected in October 2017 in
Aloutta monkeys in an Atlantic Forest area. From 542 NHP, a total of 162 NHP were
YFV positive by RT-qPCR and/or immunohistochemistry, being 22 Callithrix-spp.
most from urban areas. Entomological collections executed did not detect the
presence of strictly sylvatic mosquitoes. Three mosquito pools were positive for 
YFV, 2 Haemagogus leucocelaenus, and 1 Aedes scapularis. In summary, YFV in the
São Paulo urban area was detected mainly in resident marmosets, and synanthropic 
mosquitoes were likely involved in viral transmission.

In humans and macaque monkeys, socially relevant face processing is accomplished 
via a distributed functional network that includes specialized patches in frontal
cortex. It is unclear whether a similar network exists in New World primates, who
diverged ~35 million years from Old World primates. The common marmoset is a New 
World primate species ideally placed to address this question given their complex
social repertoire. Here, we demonstrate the existence of a putative high-level
face processing network in marmosets. Like Old World primates, marmosets show
differential activation in anterior cingulate and lateral prefrontal cortices
while they view socially relevant videos of marmoset faces. We corroborate the
locations of these frontal regions by demonstrating functional and structural
connectivity between these regions and temporal lobe face patches. Given the
evolutionary separation between macaques and marmosets, our results suggest this 
frontal network specialized for social face processing predates the separation
between Platyrrhini and Catarrhini.

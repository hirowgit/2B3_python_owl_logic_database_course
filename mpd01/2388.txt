BACKGROUND/AIMS: Chronic infection with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) is strongly
associated with the development of hepatocellular carcinoma but the mechanism by 
which this occurs is unknown. Numerous studies have focused on the HBV X protein 
showing that it activates signal transduction pathways while few have
investigated these changes in HBV-replicating hepatocytes.
METHODS: We utilized the recombinant adenovirus system to deliver a replication
competent HBV genome into Huh7 and primary marmoset hepatocytes (PMH) to examine 
the effects of active viral replication on the regulation of Ras-ERK signal
transduction and related pathways.
RESULTS: Huh7 cells and PMHs replicating HBV demonstrated significant
upregulation in phosphorylated ERK, Akt, c-myc together with increased p53,
cyclin B1 and p21(cip1) expression and cell cycle progression to G2 phase in the 
absence of increased cell proliferation. Phosphorylation of the key cell survival
kinase, Akt, was significantly increased, resulting in increased serine
phosphorylation of the downstream target, GSK3-beta.
CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrated simultaneous activation of the MAP Kinase
and Akt pathways in HBV-replicating hepatocytes that resulted in dysregulation in
the control of cell cycle progression and which help explain the early pathogenic
mechanisms that underlie malignant transformation associated with chronic
hepatitis B infection.

Alternative splicing is a hallmark of glycoprotein hormone receptor gene
regulation, but its molecular mechanism is unknown. The LH receptor (LHR) gene
possesses 11 exons, but exon 10 is constitutively skipped in the New World monkey
lineage (LHR type 2), whereas it is constitutively spliced in the human (LHR type
1). This study identifies the regulatory elements of exon 10 usage. Sequencing of
genomic marmoset DNA revealed that the cryptic LHR exon 10 is highly homologous
to exon 10 from other species and displays intact splice sites. Functional
studies using a minigene approach excluded the contribution of intronic,
marmoset-specific long interspersed nucleotide-1 elements to exon 10 skipping.
Sequencing of the genomic regions surrounding exon 10 from several primate
lineages, sequence comparisons including the human and mouse LHR gene, revealed
the presence of unique nucleotides at 3'-intronic position -19 and -10 and at
position +26 within exon 10 of the marmoset LHR. Exon trap experiments and in
vitro mutagenesis of these nucleotides resulted in the identification of a
composite regulatory element of splicing consisting of cis-acting elements
represented by two polypyrimidine tracts and a trans-acting element within exon
10, which affect the secondary RNA structure. Changes within this complex
resulted either in constitutive exon inclusion, constitutive skipping, or
alternative splicing of exon 10. This work delineates the molecular pathway
leading to intronization of exon 10 in the LHR type 2 and reveals, for the first 
time, the essential function of regulatory and structural elements involved in
glycoprotein hormone receptor splicing.

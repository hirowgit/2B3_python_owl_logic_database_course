BACKGROUND: Zoonotic infections with epidemic potential, as non-human primate
malaria and yellow fever (YF), can overlap geographically. Optimizing a small
blood sample for diagnosis and surveillance is of great importance. Blood are
routinely collected for YF diagnosis and blood clots usually discarded after
serum obtention. Aiming to take sample advantage, the sensitivity of a PCR using 
extracted DNA from long-term frozen clots from human and non-human primates for
detection of Plasmodium spp. in low parasitaemia conditions was assayed.
RESULTS: Malaria diagnosis with DNA extracted from blood clots generated results 
in agreement with samples obtained with whole blood, including mixed Plasmodium
vivax/simium and Plasmodium malariae/brasilianum infections.
CONCLUSION: Blood clots from human and non-human primates may be an important and
low cost source of DNA for malaria surveillance in the Atlantic Forest.

Humans and nonhuman primates (NHP) are similar in behavior and in physiology,
specifically the structure, function, and complexity of the immune system. Thus, 
NHP models are desirable for pathophysiology and pharmacology/toxicology studies.
Furthermore, NHP-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) may enable
transformative developmental, translational, or evolutionary studies in a field
of inquiry currently hampered by the limited availability of research specimens. 
NHP-iPSCs may address specific questions that can be studied back and forth
between in vitro cellular assays and in vivo experimentations, an investigational
process that in most cases cannot be performed on humans because of safety and
ethical issues. The use of NHP model systems and cell specific in vitro models is
evolving with iPSC-based three-dimensional (3D) cell culture systems and
organoids, which may offer reliable in vitro models and reduce the number of
animals used in experimental research. IPSCs have the potential to give rise to
defined cell types of any organ of the body. However, standards for deriving
defined and validated NHP iPSCs are missing. Standards for deriving high-quality 
iPSC cell lines promote rigorous and replicable scientific research and likewise,
validated cell lines reduce variability and discrepancies in results between
laboratories. We have derived and validated NHP iPSC lines by confirming their
pluripotency and propensity to differentiate into all three germ layers
(ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm) according to standards and measurable limits
for a set of marker genes. The iPSC lines were characterized for their potential 
to generate neural stem cells and to differentiate into dopaminergic neurons.
These iPSC lines are available to the scientific community. NHP-iPSCs fulfill a
unique niche in comparative genomics to understand gene regulatory principles
underlying emergence of human traits, in infectious disease pathogenesis, in
vaccine development, and in immunological barriers in regenerative medicine.

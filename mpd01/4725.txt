Histopathology of experimental Legionnaires' disease in guinea pigs, rhesus
monkeys and marmosets.

Baskerville A, Fitzgeorge RB, Broster M, Hambleton P.

Guinea pigs, rhesus monkeys and marmosets were infected with L. pneumophila in
small particle aerosols. Fever and acute fibrinopurulent pneumonia resulted. The 
lesions involved distal lung tissue only, spreading from terminal and respiratory
bronchioles and producing heavy infiltration of alveoli by polymorphs and
macrophages and widespread exudation of oedema fluid and fibrin. Lesions were not
found in extra-pulmonary sites.

Plasma testosterone response to hCG stimulation in the male marmoset monkey
(Callithrix jacchus jacchus).

Kholkute SD, Aitken RJ, Lunn SF.

In adult animals the intramuscular injection of hCG was followed by a rapid rise 
in plasma testosterone levels within 2-3 h and at doses of 40 and 80 i.u. hCG
this primary response was followed by a second peak of testosterone at 48 h.
Prepubertal marmosets also responded to hCG stimulation with a rapid increase in 
plasma testosterone levels within 3 h, but the magnitude of this peak was lower
than that observed in adult animals and no biphasic pattern was observed. In
adult and prepubertal animals a second dose of hCG (40 i.u.) administered 24 h
after the initial injection failed to produce a further rapid increment in plasma
testosterone levels.

Development of a marmoset colony in Australia.

McIntosh GH, Looker JW.

A breeding nucleus of 15 pairs of Callithrix jacchus jacchus was imported from an
established colony in the United Kingdom in 1978, and these have now multiplied
to 137 animals. Good reproductive efficiency and growth rates have occurred in
this colony, with minimal problems from diseases of nutritional or infectious
origin. One episode of cessation of breeding and abortions was attributed to
excessive noise and disturbance of the normal routine.

Rapid regression of fetal adrenal zone and absence of adrenal reticular zone in
the marmoset.

Levine J, Wolfe LG, Schiebinger RJ, Loriaux DL, Cutler GB Jr.

Developmental changes in plasma dehydropiandrosterone (DHA) and in adrenal
histology were studied in several marmoset species (Callithrix jacchus and
Saguinus labiatus, nigricollis, and fuscicollis) to evaluate these primates as
experimental models for the study of fetal adrenal zone regression. Newborn
marmosets had a prominent fetal adrenal zone, plasma DHA levels above 1000 ng/dl,
and plasma DHA sulfate (DHAS) levels of 140 micrograms/dl. The fetal zone
regressed dramatically during the first week of life, paralleled by a marked
decline in plasma DHA, the plasma DHA to cortisol ratio, and plasma DHAS. The
adult marmoset, however, had no adrenal reticular zone and no evidence of adrenal
DHA secretion; DHA levels in castrate adults were undetectable (less than 25
ng/dl). Thus, the marmoset represents the first example of a primate that has a
regressing, DHA- and DHAS-secreting fetal adrenal zone but that does not
subsequently develop a DHA-secreting adrenal reticular zone.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the agent of
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is responsible for the worst pandemic of the
21st century. Like all human coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 originated in a wildlife
reservoir, most likely from bats. As SARS-CoV-2 has spread across the globe in
humans, it has spilled over to infect a variety of non-human animal species in
domestic, farm, and zoo settings. Additionally, a broad range of species,
including one neotropical monkey, have proven to be susceptible to experimental
infection with SARS-CoV-2. Together, these findings raise the specter of
establishment of novel enzootic cycles of SARS-CoV-2. To assess the potential
exposure of free-living non-human primates to SARS-CoV-2, we sampled 60
neotropical monkeys living in proximity to Manaus and São José do Rio Preto, two 
hotspots for COVID-19 in Brazil. Our molecular and serological tests detected no 
evidence of SAR-CoV-2 infection among these populations. While this result is
reassuring, sustained surveillance efforts of wildlife living in close
association with human populations is warranted, given the stochastic nature of
spillover events and the enormous implications of SARS-CoV-2 spillover for human 
health.

Background: Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated gene therapies are rapidly
advancing to the clinic, and AAV engineering has resulted in vectors with
increased ability to deliver therapeutic genes. Although the choice of vector is 
critical, quantitative comparison of AAVs, especially in large animals, remains
challenging.
Methods: Here, we developed an efficient single-cell AAV engineering pipeline
(scAAVengr) to simultaneously quantify and rank efficiency of competing AAV
vectors across all cell types in the same animal.
Results: To demonstrate proof-of-concept for the scAAVengr workflow, we
quantified - with cell-type resolution - the abilities of naturally occurring and
newly engineered AAVs to mediate gene expression in primate retina following
intravitreal injection. A top performing variant identified using this pipeline, 
K912, was used to deliver SaCas9 and edit the rhodopsin gene in macaque retina,
resulting in editing efficiency similar to infection rates detected by the
scAAVengr workflow. scAAVengr was then used to identify top-performing AAV
variants in mouse brain, heart, and liver following systemic injection.
Conclusions: These results validate scAAVengr as a powerful method for
development of AAV vectors.
Funding: This work was supported by funding from the Ford Foundation, NEI/NIH,
Research to Prevent Blindness, Foundation Fighting Blindness, UPMC Immune
Transplant and Therapy Center, and the Van Sloun fund for canine genetic
research.

plain-language-summary: Gene therapy is an experimental approach to treating
disease that involves altering faulty genes or replacing them with new, working
copies. Most often, the new genetic material is delivered into cells using a
modified virus that no longer causes disease, called a viral vector.
Virus-mediated gene therapies are currently being explored for degenerative eye
diseases, such as retinitis pigmentosa, and neurological disorders, like
Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease. A number of gene therapies have also been
approved for treating some rare cancers, blood disorders and a childhood form of 
motor neuron disease. Despite the promise of virus-mediated gene therapy, there
are significant hurdles to its widespread success. Viral vectors need to deliver 
enough genetic material to the right cells without triggering an immune response 
or causing serious side effects. Selecting an optimal vector is key to achieving 
this. A type of viruses called adeno-associated viruses (AAV) are prime
candidates, partly because they can be easily engineered. However, accurately
comparing the safety and efficacy of newly engineered AAVs is difficult, due to
variation between test subjects and the labor and cost involved in careful
testing. Öztürk et al. addressed this issue by developing an experimental
pipeline called scAAVengr for comparing gene therapy vectors head-to-head. The
process involves tagging potential AAV vectors with unique genetic barcodes,
which can then be detected and quantified in individual cells using a technique
called single-cell RNA sequencing. This means that when several vectors are used 
to infect lab-grown cells or a test animal at the same time, they can be tracked.
The vectors can then be ranked on their ability to infect specific cell types and
deliver useful genetic material. Using scAAVengr, Öztürk et al. compared viral
vectors designed to target the light-sensitive cells of the retina, which allow
animals to see. First, a set of promising viral vectors were evaluated using the 
scAAVengr pipeline in the eyes of marmosets and macaques, two small primates.
Precise levels and locations of gene delivery were quantified. The top-performing
vector was then identified and used to deliver Cas9, a genome editing tool, to
primate retinas. Öztürk et al. also used scAAVengr to compare viral vectors in
mice, analysing the vectors’ ability to deliver their genetic cargo to the brain,
heart, and liver. These experiments demonstrated that scAAVengr can be used to
evaluate vectors in multiple tissues and in different organisms. In summary, this
work outlines a method for identifying and precisely quantifying the performance 
of top-performing viral vectors for gene therapy. By aiding the selection of
optimal viral vectors, the scAAVengr pipeline could help to improve the success
of preclinical studies and early clinical trials testing gene therapies.

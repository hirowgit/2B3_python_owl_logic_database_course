Gene therapy continues to be a promising contender for the treatment of cystic
fibrosis (CF) airway disease. We have previously demonstrated that airway
conditioning with lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) followed by delivery of a
HIV-1-based lentiviral (LV) vector functionally corrects the CF transmembrane
conductance regulator (CFTR) defect in the nasal airways of CF mice. In our
earlier pilot study we showed that our technique can transduce marmoset lungs
acutely; this study extends that work to examine gene expression in this nonhuman
primate (NHP) 1 month after gene vector treatment. A mixture of three separate
HIV-1 vesicular stomatitis virus G (VSV-G)-pseudotyped LV vectors containing the 
luciferase (Luc), LacZ, and hCFTR transgenes was delivered into the trachea
through a miniature bronchoscope. We examined whether a single-dose delivery of
LV vector after LPC conditioning could increase levels of transgene expression in
the trachea and lungs compared with control (phosphate-buffered saline [PBS])
conditioning. At 1 month, bioluminescence was detected in vivo in the trachea of 
three of the six animals within the PBS control group, compared with five of the 
six LPC-treated animals. When examined ex vivo there was weak evidence that LPC
improves tracheal Luc expression levels. In the lungs, bioluminescence was
detected in vivo in four of the six PBS-treated animals, compared with five of
the six LPC-treated animals; however, bioluminescence was present in all lungs
when imaged ex vivo. LacZ expression was predominantly observed in the alveolar
regions of the lung. hCFTR was detected by qPCR in the lungs of five animals.
Basal cells were successfully isolated and expanded from marmoset tracheas, but
no LacZ-positive colonies were detected. There was no evidence of an inflammatory
response toward the LV vector at 1 month postdelivery, with cytokines remaining
at baseline levels. In conclusion, we found weak evidence that LPC conditioning
improved gene transduction in the trachea, but not in the marmoset lungs. We also
highlight some of the challenges associated with translational lung gene therapy 
studies in NHPs.

A gradient coil with integrated second and third order shims has been designed
and constructed for use inside an actively shielded 310 mm horizontal bore 9.4 T 
small animal MRI. An extension of the boundary element method, to minimise the
power deposited in conducting surfaces, was used to design the gradients, and a
boundary element method with a constraint on mutual inductance was used to design
the shims. The gradient coil allows for improved imaging performance and was
optimized for an imaging region appropriate for marmoset imaging studies.
Efficiencies of 1.5 mT m-1 A-1 were achieved in a 15 cm wide bore while
maintaining gradient uniformity â‰¤5% over the 8 cm region of interest. Two new
cooling methods were implemented which allowed the gradient coil to operate at
100 A RMS, 25 % of max current with a temperature rise below 30 C.

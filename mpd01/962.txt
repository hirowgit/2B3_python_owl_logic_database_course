The common marmoset has attracted increasing interest as a model for visual
neuroscience. A measurement of fundamental importance to ensure the validity of
visual studies is spatial acuity. The marmoset has excellent acuity that has been
reported at the fovea to be nearly half that of the human (Ordy and Samorajski
[]: Vision Res 8:1205-1225), a value that is consistent with them having similar 
photoreceptor densities combined with their smaller eye size (Troilo et al. []:
Vision Res 33:1301-1310). Of interest, the marmoset exhibits a higher proportion 
of cones than rods in peripheral vision than human or macaque, which in principle
could endow them with better peripheral acuity depending on how those signals are
pooled in subsequent processing. Here, we introduce a simple behavioral paradigm 
to measure acuity and then test how acuity in the marmoset scales with
eccentricity. We trained subjects to fixate a central point and detect a
peripheral Gabor by making a saccade to its location. First, we found that
accurate assessment of acuity required correction for myopia in all adult
subjects. This is an important point because marmosets raised in laboratory
conditions often have mild to severe myopia (Graham and Judge []: Vision Res
39:177-187), a finding that we confirm, and that would limit their utility for
studies of vision if uncorrected. With corrected vision, we found that their
acuity scales with eccentricity similar to that of humans and macaques, having
roughly half the value of the human and with no clear departure for higher acuity
in the periphery. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Develop Neurobiol 77: 300-313,

The common marmoset is a non-human primate that has increasingly employed in the 
biomedical research including the fields of neuroscience and behavioral studies. 
Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D has been speculated to be involved in psycho-neurologic 
actions in the human brain. In the present study, to clarify the role of CYP2D in
the marmoset brain, we investigated the expression patterns of CYP2D mRNA in the 
brain using in situ hybridization (ISH). In addition, to identify the gene
location of CYP2D19, a well-studied CYP2D isoform in the common marmoset, a
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) study was performed. Consistent with
findings for the human brain, CYP2D mRNA was localized in the neuronal cells of
different brain regions; e.g., the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, substantia
nigra, and cerebellum. FISH analysis showed that the CYP2D19 gene was located on 
chromosome 1q, which is homologous to human chromosome 22 on which the CYP2D6
gene exists. These results suggest that CYP2D in the marmoset brain may play the 
same role as human CYP2D6 in terms of brain actions, and that the CYP2D19 gene is
conserved in a syntenic manner. Taken together, these findings suggest that the
common marmoset is a useful model for studying psychiatric disorders related to
CYP2D dysfunction in the brain.

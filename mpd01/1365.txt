Vocalizations of common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) were examined under
experimental situations related to fear or anxiety. When marmosets were isolated 
in an unfamiliar environment, they frequently vocalized "tsik-egg" calls, which
were the combination calls of 'tsik' followed by several 'egg'. Tsik-egg calls
were also observed after treatment with the anxiogenic drug FG-7142 (20mg/kg,
sc). In contrast, when marmosets were exposed to predatory stimuli as
fear-evoking situations, they frequently vocalized tsik solo calls as well as
tsik-egg calls. These results suggest that marmosets dissociate the vocalization 
of tsik-egg and tsik calls under conditions related to fear/anxiety; tsik-egg
solo vocalizations were emitted under anxiety-related conditions (e.g., isolation
and anxiogenic drug treatment), whereas a mixed vocalization of tsik-egg and tsik
was emitted when confronted with fear-provoking stimuli (i.e., threatening
predatory stimuli). Tsik-egg call with/without tsik can be used as a specific
vocal index of fear/anxiety in marmosets, which allows us to understand the
neural mechanism of negative emotions in primate.

PURPOSE: Bifocal contact lenses were used to impose hyperopic and myopic defocus 
on the peripheral retina of marmosets. Eye growth and refractive state were
compared with untreated animals and those treated with single-vision or multizone
contact lenses from earlier studies.
METHODS: Thirty juvenile marmosets wore one of three experimental annular bifocal
contact lens designs on their right eyes and a plano contact lens on the left eye
as a control for 10 weeks from 70 days of age (10 marmosets/group). The
experimental designs had plano center zones (1.5 or 3 mm) and +5 diopters [D] or 
-5 D in the periphery (referred to as +5 D/1.5 mm, +5 D/3 mm and -5 D/3 mm). We
measured the central and peripheral mean spherical refractive error (MSE),
vitreous chamber depth (VC), pupil diameter (PD), calculated eye growth, and
myopia progression rates prior to and during treatment. The results were compared
with age-matched untreated (N=25), single-vision positive (N=19), negative
(N=16), and +5/-5 D multizone lens-reared marmosets (N=10).
RESULTS: At the end of treatment, animals in the -5 D/3 mm group had larger
(P<0.01) and more myopic eyes (P<0.05) than animals in the +5 D/1.5 mm group.
There was a dose-dependent relationship between the peripheral treatment zone
area and the treatment-induced changes in eye growth and refractive state.
Pretreatment ocular growth rates and baseline peripheral refraction accounted for
40% of the induced refraction and axial growth rate changes.
CONCLUSIONS: Eye growth and refractive state can be manipulated by altering
peripheral retinal defocus. Imposing peripheral hyperopic defocus produces axial 
myopia, whereas peripheral myopic defocus produces axial hyperopia. The effects
are smaller than using single-vision contact lenses that impose full-field
defocus, but support the use of bifocal or multifocal contact lenses as an
effective treatment for myopia control.

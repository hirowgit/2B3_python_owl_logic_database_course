Until the late twentieth century, it was believed that different sensory
modalities were processed by largely independent pathways in the primate cortex, 
with cross-modal integration only occurring in specialized polysensory areas.
This model was challenged by the finding that the peripheral representation of
the primary visual cortex (V1) receives monosynaptic connections from areas of
the auditory cortex in the macaque. However, auditory projections to V1 have not 
been reported in other primates. We investigated the existence of direct
interconnections between V1 and auditory areas in the marmoset, a New World
monkey. Labelled neurons in auditory cortex were observed following 4 out of 10
retrograde tracer injections involving V1. These projections to V1 originated in 
the caudal subdivisions of auditory cortex (primary auditory cortex, caudal belt 
and parabelt areas), and targeted parts of V1 that represent parafoveal and
peripheral vision. Injections near the representation of the vertical meridian of
the visual field labelled few or no cells in auditory cortex. We also placed 8
retrograde tracer injections involving core, belt and parabelt auditory areas,
none of which revealed direct projections from V1. These results confirm the
existence of a direct, nonreciprocal projection from auditory areas to V1 in a
different primate species, which has evolved separately from the macaque for over
30 million years. The essential similarity of these observations between marmoset
and macaque indicate that early-stage audiovisual integration is a shared
characteristic of primate sensory processing.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is uniquely suited for longitudinal
studies of cognitive aging, due to a relatively short lifespan, sophisticated
cognitive abilities, and patterns of brain aging that resemble those of humans.
We examined cognitive function and fine motor skills in male and female marmosets
(mean age ∼5 at study entry) followed longitudinally for 2 years. Each year,
monkeys were tested on a reversal learning task with three pairs of stimuli
(n = 18, 9 females) and a fine motor task requiring them to grasp small rewards
from two staircases (Hill and Valley test, n = 12, 6 females). There was little
evidence for a decline in cognitive flexibility between the two time points, in
part because of practice effects. However, independent of year of testing,
females took longer than males to reach criterion in the reversals, indicating
impaired cognitive flexibility. Motivation was unlikely to contribute to this
effect, as males refused a greater percentage of trials than females in the
reversals. With regards to motor function, females were significantly faster than
males in the Hill and Valley task. From Year 1 to Year 2, a slight slowing of
motor function was observed in both sexes, but accuracy decreased significantly
in males only. This study (1) demonstrates that marmosets exhibit sex differences
in cognitive flexibility and fine motor function that resemble those described in
humans; (2) that changes in fine motor function can already be detected at
middle-age; and (3) that males may experience greater age-related changes in fine
motor skills than females. Additional data points will determine whether these
sex and age differences persist over time.

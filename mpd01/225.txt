HLA-F represents one of the nonclassical MHC class I molecules in humans. Its
main characteristics involve low levels of polymorphism in combination with a
restricted tissue distribution. This signals that the gene product executes a
specialised function, which, however, is still poorly understood. Relatively
little is known about the evolutionary equivalents of this gene in nonhuman
primates, especially with regard to population data. Here we report a comparative
genetic analysis of the orthologous genes of HLA-F in various great ape, Old
World monkey (OWM), and New World monkey (NWM) species. HLA-F-related transcripts
were found in all subjects studied. Low levels of polymorphism were encountered, 
although the length of the predicted gene products may vary. In most species, one
or two transcripts were discovered, indicating the presence of only one active
F-like gene per chromosome. An exception was provided by a New World monkey
species, namely, the common marmoset. In this species, the gene has been subject 
to duplication, giving rise to up to six F-like transcripts per animal. In
humans, great apes, and OWM, and probably the majority of the NWM species, the
evolutionary equivalents of the HLA-F gene experienced purifying selection. In
the marmoset, however, the gene was initially duplicated, but the expansion was
subjected afterwards to various mechanisms of genetic inactivation, as evidenced 
by the presence of pseudogenes and an array of genetic artefacts in a section of 
the transcripts.

Plasma concentrations of acetaminophen, its glucuronide and sulfate conjugates,
and cysteinyl acetaminophen were experimentally determined after oral
administrations of 10 mg/kg in humanised-liver mice, control mice, rats, common
marmosets, cynomolgus monkeys, and minipigs; the results were compared with
reported human pharmacokinetic data. Among the animals tested, only rats
predominantly converted acetaminophen to sulfate conjugates, rather than
glucuronide conjugates. In contrast, the values of area under the plasma
concentration curves of acetaminophen, its glucuronide and sulfate conjugates,
and cysteinyl acetaminophen after oral administration of acetaminophen in
marmosets and minipigs were consistent with those reported in humans under the
present conditions. Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models
(consisting of the gut, liver, and central compartments) for acetaminophen and
its primary metabolite could reproduce and estimate, respectively, the plasma and
hepatic concentrations of acetaminophen in experimental animals and humans after 
single virtual oral doses. The values of area under the curves of hepatic
concentrations of acetaminophen estimated using PBPK models were correlated with 
the measured levels of cysteinyl acetaminophen (a deactivated metabolite) in
plasma fractions in these species. Consequently, using simple PBPK models and
plasma data to predict hepatic chemical concentrations after oral doses could be 
helpful as an indicator of in vivo possible hepatotoxicity of chemicals such as
acetaminophen.

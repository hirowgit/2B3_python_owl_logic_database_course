The genetic and biological similarity between non-human primates and humans has
ensured the continued use of primates in biomedical research where other species 
cannot be used. Health-monitoring programmes for non-human primates provide an
approach to monitor and control both endemic and incoming agents that may cause
zoonotic and anthroponotic disease or interfere with research outcomes. In 1999
FELASA recommendations were published which aimed to provide a harmonized
approach to health monitoring programmes for non-human primates. Scientific and
technological progress, understanding of non-human primates and evolving
microbiology has necessitated a review and replacement of the current
recommendations. These new recommendations are aimed at users and breeders of the
commonly used non-human primates; Macaca mulatta (Rhesus macaque) and Macaca
fascicularis (Cynomolgus macaque). In addition, other species including
Callithrix jacchus (Common marmoset) Saimiri sciureus (Squirrel monkey) and
others are included. The important and challenging aspects of non-human primate
health-monitoring programmes are discussed, including management protocols to
maintain and improve health status, health screening strategies and procedures,
health reporting and certification. In addition, information is provided on
specific micro-organisms and the recommended frequency of testing.

The genus Bifidobacterium is purported to have beneficial consequences for human 
health and is a major component of many gastrointestinal probiotics. Although
species of Bifidobacterium are generally at low relative frequency in the adult
human gastrointestinal tract, they can constitute high proportions of the
gastrointestinal communities of adult marmosets. To identify genes that might be 
important for the maintenance of Bifidobacterium in adult marmosets, ten strains 
of Bifidobacterium were isolated from the feces of seven adult marmosets, and
their genomes were sequenced. There were six B. reuteri strains, two B.
callitrichos strains, one B. myosotis sp. nov. and one B. tissieri sp. nov. among
our isolates. Phylogenetic analysis showed that three of the four species we
isolated were most closely related to B. bifidum, B. breve and B. longum, which
are species found in high abundance in human infants. There were 1357 genes that 
were shared by at least one strain of B. reuteri, B. callitrichos, B. breve, and 
B. longum, and 987 genes that were found in all strains of the four species.
There were 106 genes found in B. reuteri and B. callitrichos but not in human
bifidobacteria, and several of these genes were involved in nutrient uptake.
These pathways for nutrient uptake appeared to be specific to Bifidobacterium
from New World monkeys. Additionally, the distribution of Bifidobacterium in
fecal samples from captive adult marmosets constituted as much as 80% of the gut 
microbiome, although this was variable between individuals and colonies. We
suggest that nutrient transporters may be important for the maintenance of
Bifidobacterium during adulthood in marmosets.

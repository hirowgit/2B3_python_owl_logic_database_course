BACKGROUND: Common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) are potentially useful nonhuman
primate models for preclinical studies. Information for major drug-metabolizing
cytochrome P450 (P450) enzymes is now available that supports the use of this
primate species as an animal model for drug development. Here, we collect and
provide an overview of information on the activities of common marmoset hepatic
and intestinal microsomes with respect to 28 typical human P450 probe oxidations.
RESULTS: Marmoset P450 2D6/8-dependent R-metoprolol O-demethylation activities in
hepatic microsomes were significantly correlated with those of midazolam 1'- and 
4-hydroxylations, testosterone 6β-hydroxylation, and progesterone
6β-hydroxylation, which are probe reactions for marmoset P450 3A4/5/90. In
marmosets, the oxidation activities of hepatic microsomes and intestinal
microsomes were roughly comparable for midazolam and terfenadine. Overall,
multiple forms of marmoset P450 enzymes in livers and intestines had generally
similar substrate recognition functionalities to those of human and/or cynomolgus
monkey P450 enzymes.
CONCLUSION: The marmoset could be a model animal for humans with respect to the
first-pass extraction of terfenadine and related substrates. These findings
provide a foundation for understanding individual pharmacokinetic and
toxicological results in nonhuman primates as preclinical models and will help to
further support understanding of the molecular mechanisms of human P450 function.

To reduce the vulnerability of their small body size, common marmosets live in
large and cohesive social groups. Thus, we hypothesized that in order to
compensate for small body size and predation risk, individuals of common
marmosets will stay gathered rather than scattered when foraging for eggs and/or 
nestling birds. Furthermore, in order to avoid costly injuries and eventual
predation risks, for both sides, the majority of interactions among common
marmosets and small birds will not involve direct physical contact. The study was
developed in a small fragment of Atlantic Forest in the northeast of Brazil. We
recorded a total of 115 interactions between common marmosets (Callithrix
jacchus) with 7 different bird species. As expected, agonistic interactions were 
significantly more frequent when the marmosets were gathered. Also, most
agonistic interactions by the birds toward common marmosets involved overflights 
without physical contact. Apparently, the set of avoidance behavior leads to a
reduced predation risk for both sides. It appears that dispersed marmosets do not
represent an imminent threat that justifies an agonistic reaction by the birds as
the latter appear to avoid exposing themselves to unnecessary danger during
agonistic interactions, especially when the marmosets are gathered.

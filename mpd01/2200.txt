We report here for the first time the isolation and identification of the common 
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) huntingtin (Htt) gene, whose ortholog in humans is 
known to be related to Huntington's disease (HD). A 9396 nucleotide complementary
DNA (cDNA) carrying the putative full-length open reading frame of the marmoset
Htt gene was identified, and highly conserved nucleotide and amino acid sequences
among primates were observed. Based on this data and using tools evaluated for
the detection of the marmoset Htt gene, we have demonstrated gene silencing
against the expression of endogenous Htt gene in immortalized common marmoset
mononuclear cells by means of RNA interference (RNAi). Taken together, the data
presented here may assist us in realizing a non-human primate HD model with the
common marmoset.

Methionine aminopeptidase-2 (MetAP-2) inhibitors have potent anti-angiogenesis
activity and are being developed for the treatment of solid tumours. The recently
observed specific expression of MetAP-2 in germinal centre B cells suggests that 
it has a role in regulating B cell function. We have demonstrated a potent
MetAP-2-dependent inhibitory effect on the antibody secretion from B cell
receptor and CD40 co-stimulated primary human B cells in the presence of
interleukin-21. The effect of MetAP-2 inhibition on antibody secretion was due to
a block in differentiation of B cells into plasma cells. Immunohistochemical
analysis of germinal centres from human, mouse and marmoset spleen showed a
similar expression pattern of MetAP-2 in the marmoset and man, whereas mouse
spleen showed no detectable expression. In a marmoset, T dependent immunization
model, the MetAP-2 inhibitor suppressed an antigen-specific antibody response.
Furthermore, histological analysis showed loss of B cells in the spleen and
disrupted germinal centre formation. These results provide experimental evidence 
to support a novel role for MetAP-2 in immunomodulation. These effects of MetAP-2
are mediated by disruption of the germinal centre reaction and a block in the
differentiation of B cells into plasma cells.

Common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) are frequently used as translational animal
models for human diseases. However, a comparative study of cytological and
histochemical detection methods as well as morphometric and ultrastructural
characterization of neutrophils and eosinophils in this species is lacking. Blood
samples of house dust mite sensitized and allergen challenged as well as
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenged marmosets were analyzed with different
cytological and histological staining methods. Furthermore, cell size and number 
of nuclear segments were compared between neutrophils and eosinophils. Electron
microscopy was performed to characterize the ultrastructure of granulocytes. Of
all applied cytological stains, three allowed differentiation of eosinophils and 
neutrophils and, thus, reliable quantification in blood smears:
May-Grünwald-Giemsa stain, Congo Red and Naphthol AS-D Chloroacetate-Esterase.
For histology, Hematoxylin-Eosin (H&E) could not demonstrate clear differences,
whereas Sirius Red, Congo Red, and Naphthol AS-D Chloroacetate Esterase showed
capable results for identification of eosinophils or neutrophils in lung tissue. 
Morphometry revealed that marmoset neutrophils have more nuclear segments and are
slightly larger than eosinophils. Ultrastructurally, eosinophils presented with
large homogeneous electron-dense granules without crystalloid cores, while
neutrophils were characterized by heterogeneous granules of different size and
density. Additionally, sombrero-like vesicles were detected in tissue eosinophils
of atopic marmosets, indicative for hypersensitivity-related piecemeal
degranulation. In conclusion, we provide a detailed overview of marmoset
eosinophils and neutrophils, important for phenotypic characterization of
marmoset models for human airway diseases.

BACKGROUND: The increasing life span of Callithrix jacchus in combination with
the occurrence of metabolic and age-dependent diseases requires improved health
surveillance for this species.
METHODS: The health status of 56 marmosets was studied using a non-invasive blood
pressure (BP) device. Age-, weight-, and sex-dependent changes were analyzed.
Four animals with striking BP findings had follow-up exams.
RESULTS: Physiological and pathological BP values could be defined. BP positively
correlated with age and weight, while no effect of sex could be found.
Measurement time for female and older animals was shorter than for male and
younger individuals. Further analysis of the suspicious patients revealed renal
or hepatic diseases and cardiac alterations.
CONCLUSION: The description of age and weight influences on BP delivers
physiological and pathological values for common marmosets. This may contribute
to the understanding of aging process and cardiology in this primate species.

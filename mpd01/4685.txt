Pygmy marmosets (Cebuella pygmaea) use a variety of trill-like vocalizations to
maintain contact among group members throughout the day. Frequently, when one
animal gives a trill, other animals will respond antiphonally. Among three pygmy 
marmosets in a captive group, there were clear patterns or sequences of calling
among animals. All three animals would call in sequence more frequently than
expected by chance, while the likelihood of an animal calling twice before each
of the other animals called once was less than expected by chance. One particular
ordering of three individuals calling in sequence was more common than the other 
ordering of three animals. Individual differences were found between the
likelihood of initiating call sequences and the likelihood of calling later in a 
sequence. Pygmy marmosets appear to have a conversational rule system to govern
their antiphonal calling.

Callithrix aurita, an endangered marmoset endemic to eastern Brazil, was observed
from June to October 1982. Preliminary observations suggest that behavioral and
morphological differences exist which distinguish C. aurita from the common
marmoset, C. jacchus. New data are provided on the geographic distribution of C. 
aurita, extending it northward within the known ranges of C. penicillata in the
states of Sao Paulo and Minas Gerais and C. flaviceps in eastern Minas Gerais.

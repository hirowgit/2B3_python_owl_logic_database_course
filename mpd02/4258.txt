The distribution and density of 3H-MPP+ binding sites were studied by in vitro
quantitative autoradiography in the brain of the mouse, rat and monkey. The
highest levels of 3H-MPP+ specific binding were observed in rat brain. The
substantia nigra in rat and monkey, and the anterior caudate-putamen formation in
mouse and monkey showed the lowest density of autoradiographic grains. The
presence of a relatively high density of MPP+ sites in the hippocampus of all
species studied could be of interest to explain some effects of MPTP
administration on convulsions caused by chemoconvulsants. The finding of a 60-70%
reduction of 3H-MPP+ binding sites in the rat caudate-putamen, on the side of
quinolinic acid infusion and no changes after 6-hydroxydopamine lesion of
dopaminergic nigrostriatal neurons suggests the presence of these sites mainly on
striatal cells. The results suggest that the distribution of MPP+ binding sites
in brain would not seem to be related to MPTP toxicity.

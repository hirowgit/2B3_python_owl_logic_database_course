Nonhuman primates have emerged as an excellent model of human tuberculosis, in
large part because they recapitulate the full spectrum of infection outcome and
pathology seen in humans. Several variables inherent to the nonhuman primate
models of tuberculosis are discussed in this review, including the monkey
species, Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains, and routes of infection, all of
which can influence the model to be chosen for various studies. New technologies 
for studying the microbiology, immunology, and pathogenesis of tuberculosis in
nonhuman primates have greatly expanded the capabilities of this model for basic 
and translational studies, including the development and testing of new treatment
and prevention strategies for tuberculosis.

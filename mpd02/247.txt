Perceptual sensitivity varies from moment to moment. One potential source of this
variability is spontaneous fluctuations in cortical activity that can travel as
waves1. Spontaneous travelling waves have been reported during anaesthesia2-7,
but it is not known whether they have a role during waking perception. Here,
using newly developed analytic techniques to characterize the moment-to-moment
dynamics of noisy multielectrode data, we identify spontaneous waves of activity 
in the extrastriate visual cortex of awake, behaving marmosets (Callithrix
jacchus). In monkeys trained to detect faint visual targets, the timing and
position of spontaneous travelling waves before target onset predicted the
magnitude of target-evoked activity and the likelihood of target detection. By
contrast, spatially disorganized fluctuations of neural activity were much less
predictive. These results reveal an important role for spontaneous travelling
waves in sensory processing through the modulation of neural and perceptual
sensitivity.

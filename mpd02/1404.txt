Schizophrenia is associated with upregulation of dopamine (DA) release in the
caudate nucleus. The caudate has dense connections with the orbitofrontal cortex 
(OFC) via the frontostriatal loops, and both areas exhibit pathophysiological
change in schizophrenia. Despite evidence that abnormalities in dopaminergic
neurotransmission and prefrontal cortex function co-occur in schizophrenia, the
influence of OFC DA on caudate DA and reinforcement processing is poorly
understood. To test the hypothesis that OFC dopaminergic dysfunction disrupts
caudate dopamine function, we selectively depleted dopamine from the OFC of
marmoset monkeys and measured striatal extracellular dopamine levels (using
microdialysis) and dopamine D2/D3 receptor binding (using positron emission
tomography), while modeling reinforcement-related behavior in a discrimination
learning paradigm. OFC dopamine depletion caused an increase in tonic dopamine
levels in the caudate nucleus and a corresponding reduction in D2/D3 receptor
binding. Computational modeling of behavior showed that the lesion increased
response exploration, reducing the tendency to persist with a recently chosen
response side. This effect is akin to increased response switching previously
seen in schizophrenia and was correlated with striatal but not OFC D2/D3 receptor
binding. These results demonstrate that OFC dopamine depletion is sufficient to
induce striatal hyperdopaminergia and changes in reinforcement learning relevant 
to schizophrenia.

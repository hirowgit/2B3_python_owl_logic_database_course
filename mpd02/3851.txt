In this report we demonstrate that a large number of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs)
against human epitopes cross-react with surface receptors on white blood cells of
Callithrix jacchus, indicating species similarities. However, a variety of other 
mAbs do not exhibit any cross-reactivity, thus also providing evidence for
distinct differences in the structure of these receptors among nonhuman primates.
Such differences have to be known and taken into consideration when attempting
extrapolations between species. The results presented provide the prerequisite
for performing extensive studies on immunological structures and functions in
marmosets under normal and pathological conditions. We conclude that the immune
system of Callithrix jacchus is a convenient model for studies on immunotoxicity 
with relevance for man, and for this purpose it is clearly superior to that of
any rodent species.

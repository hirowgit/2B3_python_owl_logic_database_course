Biomedical research involving animal models continues to provide important
insights into disease pathogenesis and treatment of diseases that impact human
health. In particular, nonhuman primates (NHPs) have been used extensively in
translational research due to their phylogenetic proximity to humans and
similarities to disease pathogenesis and treatment responses as assessed in
clinical trials. Microscopic changes in tissues remain a significant endpoint in 
studies involving these models. Spontaneous, expected (ie, incidental or
background) histopathologic changes are commonly encountered and influenced by
species, genetic variations, age, and geographical origin of animals, including
exposure to infectious or parasitic agents. Often, the background findings
confound study-related changes, because numbers of NHPs used in research are
limited by animal welfare and other considerations. Moreover, background findings
in NHPs can be exacerbated by experimental conditions such as treatment with
xenobiotics (eg, infectious morphological changes related to immunosuppressive
therapy). This review and summary of research-relevant conditions and pathology
in rhesus and cynomolgus macaques, baboons, African green monkeys, common
marmosets, tamarins, and squirrel and owl monkeys aims to improve the
interpretation and validity of NHP studies.

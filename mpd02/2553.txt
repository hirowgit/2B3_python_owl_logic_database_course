Sleep quantitation data on the Neotropical primate species, apart from the
squirrel monkey, are still sparse. As such, we have quantitated sleep in the
common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus), cotton top tamarins (Saguinus oedipus) and
squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus) reared in one primate facility
simultaneously, by non-invasive actigraphy. The range in total sleep time/24h
measured for male adult common marmosets, cotton top tamarins and squirrel
monkeys were 713-793 min (n=4), 707-889 min (n=4) and 459-475 min (n=2)
respectively. The range in sleep episode length /12h dark phase for marmosets,
tamarins and squirrel monkeys were 21-52 min (n=3), 10-28 min (n=4) and 9-15 min 
(n=2) respectively. Since vigilance is a critical evolutionary adaptive feature
of predator avoidance among Callitrichid monkeys and squirrel monkeys, the
shorter ranges in sleep episode length recorded, even under captivity, in this
study could be interpreted as probable indicators of such vigilance behavior
during the rest phase. We hypothesize that the vigilance behavior when it exists 
during a primate's active phase should also prevail when it is at rest (sleep).
This hypothesis deserves additional testing in female Callitrichid monkeys.

A detailed behavioral analysis of nine Callithrix penicillata was conducted in
the Marmoset Predator Confrontation Test (MPCT) during (a) four habituation
trials with no "predator," (b) six confrontation trials with the predator
(taxidermized oncilla cat, Felis tigrina), and (c) four trials with the predator 
removed. The marmosets habituated to the test apparatus with significant
decreases in locomotion, exploration and long calls. Initial exposure to the
predator elicited mainly fear-related behaviors (proximic avoidance, tsik-tsik
vocalization, swaying/tongue in-out), whereas repeated confrontations attenuated 
these behaviors, concomitant to an increase in anxiety-associated responses
(scratching/grooming/scent marking). The initial behavioral repertoire, observed 
before confrontations, was fully restored only upon removal of the predator. This
easily discernable complex defensive behavioral repertoire is hoped to provide a 
comprehensive baseline for studying the biological substrates of fear/anxiety
parameters in nonhuman primates.

Due to the global burden of dengue disease, a vaccine is urgently needed. One of 
the key points in vaccine development is the development of a robust and reliable
animal model of dengue virus infection. Characteristics including the ability to 
sustain viral replication, demonstration of clinical signs, and immune response
that resemble those of human dengue virus infection are vital in animal models.
Preclinical studies in vaccine development usually include parameters such as
safety evaluation, induction of viremia and antigenemia, immunogenicity, and
vaccine effectiveness. Although mice have been used as a model, non-human
primates have an advantage over mice because of their relative similarity to
humans in their genetic composition and immune responses. This review compares
the viremia kinetics and antibody responses of cynomolgus macaques (Macaca
fasicularis), common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus), and tamarins (Saguinus midas
and Saguinus labitus) and summarize the perspectives and the usefulness along
with challenges in dengue vaccine development.

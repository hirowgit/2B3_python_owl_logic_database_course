Area 17 of anthropoid primates does participate in visual callosal connections.

Spatz WB, Kunz B.

Injections of retrograde tracers into the border region of areas 17 and 18 in
Callithrix and Macaca labeled a small group of neurons in the border region of
contralateral area 17, in addition to cells in contralateral area 18. It is
concluded that area 17 of anthropoid primates sends (and receives) fibers through
the corpus callosum.

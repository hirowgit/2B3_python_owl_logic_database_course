A model has been developed in a nonhuman primate, the common marmoset (Callithrix
jacchus), which should enable the study of long term effects of compounds with
potentially psychoactive properties. The technique facilitates concurrent
monitoring of both behavioral and electrophysiological parameters while animals
remain in their home cages. Subjects were trained to perform tests from a
neuropsychological test battery (The Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated 
Battery, CANTAB) in which they learned to discriminate between pairs of stimuli
presented on a touch sensitive computer screen. Single channel cortical
electroencephalography (EEG) by radiotelemetry was simultaneously recorded while 
behavioral testing took place.

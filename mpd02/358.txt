Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) G2019S is a relatively common mutation,
associated with 1-3% of Parkinson's disease (PD) cases worldwide. G2019S is
hypothesized to increase LRRK2 kinase activity. Dopaminergic neurons derived from
induced pluripotent stem cells of PD patients carrying LRRK2 G2019S are reported 
to have several phenotypes compared to wild type controls, including increased
activated caspase-3 and reactive oxygen species (ROS), autophagy dysfunction, and
simplification of neurites. The common marmoset is envisioned as a candidate
nonhuman primate species for comprehensive modeling of genetic mutations. Here,
we report our successful use of CRISPR/Cas9 with repair template-mediated
homology directed repair to introduce the LRRK2 G2019S mutation, as well as a
truncation of the LRRK2 kinase domain, into marmoset embryonic and induced
pluripotent stem cells. We found that, similar to humans, marmoset LRRK2 G2019S
resulted in elevated kinase activity. Phenotypic evaluation after dopaminergic
differentiation demonstrated LRRK2 G2019S-mediated increased intracellular ROS,
decreased neuronal viability, and reduced neurite complexity. Importantly, these 
phenotypes were not observed in clones with LRRK2 truncation. These results
demonstrate the feasibility of inducing monogenic mutations in common marmosets
and support the use of this species for generating a novel genetic-based model of
PD that expresses physiological levels of LRRK2 G2019S.

Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in common marmosets is a
translationally relevant model of the chronic neurologic disease multiple
sclerosis. Following the introduction of a new dietary supplement in our
purpose-bred marmoset colony, the percentage of marmosets in which clinically
evident EAE could be induced by sensitization against recombinant human myelin
oligodendrocyte glycoprotein in IFA decreased from 100 to 65%. The reduced EAE
susceptibility after the dietary change coincided with reduced Callitrichine
herpesvirus 3 expression in the colony, an EBV-related γ1-herpesvirus associated 
with EAE. We then investigated, in a controlled study in marmoset twins, which
disease-relevant parameters were affected by the dietary change. The selected
twins had been raised on the new diet for at least 12 mo prior to the study. In
twin siblings reverted to the original diet 8 wk prior to EAE induction, 100%
disease prevalence (eight out of eight) was restored, whereas in siblings
remaining on the new diet the EAE prevalence was 75% (six out of eight). Spinal
cord demyelination, a classical hallmark of the disease, was significantly lower 
in new-diet monkeys than in monkeys reverted to the original diet. In new-diet
monkeys, the proinflammatory T cell response to recombinant human myelin
oligodendrocyte glycoprotein was significantly reduced, and RNA-sequencing
revealed reduced apoptosis and enhanced myelination in the brain. Systematic
typing of the marmoset gut microbiota using 16S rRNA sequencing demonstrated a
unique, Bifidobacteria-dominated composition, which changed after disease
induction. In conclusion, targeted dietary intervention exerts positive effects
on EAE-related parameters in multiple compartments of the marmoset's
gut-immune-CNS axis.

The white-tufted-ear marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a New World primate that
inhabits the coastal rainforests of eastern Brazil. In the present work, we
report the complete mitochondrial genome sequence of white-tufted-ear marmoset
for the first time. The total length of this mitogenome is 16,499 bp long,
containing 13 protein-coding genes, 22 transfer RNA genes, 2 ribosomal RNA genes,
and 1 non-coding region (D-loop region). The gene organization and arrangement is
identical to typical vertebrates. The overall base composition is 32.75% of A,
26.95% of T, 26.91% C, and 13.39% G, with a slight A + T bias of 59.7%. All the
genes are encoded on H-strand, except for the ND6 subunit gene and 8 tRNA genes. 
The complete mitochondrial genome sequence reported here will be useful for
comparative genomics studies in primates.

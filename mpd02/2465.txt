Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) BMRF-2 protein interaction with the beta1 family of
integrins plays an important role in EBV infection of polarized oral epithelial
cells. In this work, we characterized BMRF-2 protein expression in EBV-infected B
lymphoblastoid and polarized oral epithelial cells, and in hairy leukoplakia (HL)
epithelium. BMRF-2 expression in B cells and polarized oral epithelial cells was 
associated with the EBV lytic infection. In these cells, BMRF-2 is efficiently
transported to the cell membrane and its integrin binding Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif
is exposed on the cell surface. BMRF-2 is highly expressed in HL epithelium and
accumulates at the lateral border of oral keratinocytes. In EBV-infected
polarized oral epithelial cells, this protein is transported to the basolateral
membranes and co-localized with beta1 integrin. These data suggest that BMRF-2
may play an important role in cell-to-cell spread of EBV within the oral
epithelium. BMRF-2 is glycosylated through O-linked oligosaccharides; it forms
oligomers and is associated with the virion envelope. Its C-terminal tail is
localized in the cytoplasm. We found that beta1, alpha5, and alpha3 integrins are
present in purified EBV virions. We show that BMRF-2 is a ligand for beta1,
alpha5, alpha3, and alphav integrins and our data are consistent with a role for 
BMRF-2 in viral lytic infection.

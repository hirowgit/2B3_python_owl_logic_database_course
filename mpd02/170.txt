The generation and culture of transgene-free induced pluripotent stem cells
(iPSCs) from the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) present unique challenges
due to the fact that the protocols developed for culture of human or mouse
pluripotent cells are not sufficiently optimized for this particular monkey
species. Here, we describe the procedures for the reprogramming of marmoset fetal
fibroblasts to pluripotency with self-replicating mRNAs using a two-step
approach, where intermediate primary colonies generated in the first
reprogramming step are converted in the second step to iPSCs with customized
marmoset culture medium. The resulting iPSCs are free of transgenes and can be
maintained in long-term culture in feeder-free conditions.

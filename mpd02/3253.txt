Patterns of terminals labeled after WGA-HRP injections in the superior colliculus
(SC) in squirrel monkeys and macaque monkeys, and after DiI application in
marmosets, were related to the architecture of the pulvinar and dorsal lateral
geniculate nucleus (LGN). In all studied species, the SC projects densely to two 
architectonic subdivisions of the inferior pulvinar, the posterior inferior
pulvinar nucleus (PIp) and central medial inferior pulvinar nucleus (PIcM). These
projection zones expressed substance P. Thus, sections processed for substance P 
reveal SC termination zones in the inferior pulvinar. The medial subdivision of
the inferior pulvinar, PIm, which is known to project to visual area MT, does not
receive a significant collicular input. Injections in MT of a squirrel monkey
revealed no overlap between SC terminals and neurons projecting to area MT. Thus,
PIm is not the significant relay station of visual input from the SC to MT. The
SC also sends an input to the LGN, however, this projection is sparser than the
input directed to pulvinar.

It is known that primates including human regain some locomotor function after a 
partial spinal cord injury, but the locomotor pattern is different from before
the injury. Although these observations have many implications for improving
rehabilitative strategies, these mechanisms are not well understood. In this
study, we used a common marmoset hemisection SCI model to examine temporal
changes in locomotor pattern, in particular, intersegmental coordination of left 
hindlimb. Marmoset showed loss of detectable function in the left forelimb and
hindlimb after left unilateral hemisection of cervical spinal cord. At two weeks 
after injury, weight-bearing of the left forelimb during locomotion was limited, 
but the left hindlimb was able to plantar step. Then marmosets showed gradual
recovery in walking ability, but kinematics analysis showed differences in the
endpoint trajectory and joint angle movement. Furthermore, intersegmental
coordination in left hindlimb represented by planar covariation was preserved
over time after the injury. Previous studies have reported that planar covariance
is disrupted in patients with stroke or SCI, and that improvement in planarity
correlates with recovery in walking ability after rehabilitation. In this study, 
quadrupedal marmosets were able to walk without loss of balance even after SCI;
the different balance needs of bipedal and quadrupedal walkers may lead to
differences in planar covariation. Our results show that planar covariation was
preserved at all time points after the cervical unilateral hemisection.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a small New World primate of high
fecundity, is widely used in reproductive research. The aim of the present study 
was to determine the organization of the germ cells within the seminiferous
epithelium, the duration of the spermatogenic cycle and the number of
spermatogonial mitoses. Antibodies to cAMP response element modulator (CREM) and 
proliferating nuclear cell antigen (PCNA) and a cRNA directed against protamine
P2 and morphological criteria were used to discriminate between stages of the
spermatogenic cycle. Plastic sections were used to document the cell associations
present in each of the nine stages of spermatogenesis. Up to five such stages
could be observed within individual cross-sections of seminiferous tubules. Based
on the pattern of incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine the length of the
spermatogenic cycle was estimated to be 10 days and the duration of
spermatogenesis to be 37 days. Four mitotic divisions were noted in
spermatogonia. It is concluded that the organization of spermatogenesis in the
marmoset has similarities to the human ('helical') and this makes the marmoset a 
suitable model for studies relevant to human testicular function.

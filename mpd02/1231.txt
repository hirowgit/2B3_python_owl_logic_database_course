Centromeres usually contain large amounts of tandem repeat DNA. Alpha satellite
DNA (AS) is the most abundant tandem repeat DNA found in the centromeres of
simian primates. The AS of humans contains sequences organized into higher-order 
repeat (HOR) structures, which are tandem arrays of larger repeat units
consisting of multiple basic repeat units. HOR-carrying AS also occurs in other
hominoids, but results reported to date for phylogenetically more remote taxa
have been negative. Here we show direct evidence for clear HOR structures in AS
of the owl monkey and common marmoset. These monkeys are New World monkey species
that are located phylogenetically outside of hominoids. It is currently
postulated that the presence of HOR structures in AS is unique to hominoids. Our 
results suggest that this view must be modified. A plausible explanation is that 
generation of HOR structures is a general event that occurs occasionally or
frequently in primate centromeres, and that, in humans, HOR-carrying AS became
predominant in the central region of the centromere. It is often difficult to
assemble sequence reads of tandem repeat DNAs into accurate contig sequences; our
careful sequencing strategy allowed us to overcome this problem.

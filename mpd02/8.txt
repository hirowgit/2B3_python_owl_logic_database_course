BACKGROUND: The common marmoset is widely used in current biomedical research for
various research fields. We observed macrocytic anemia in a perinatal common
marmoset with gradual weight loss and diarrhea. The objective of this case report
is to describe the diagnosis and treatment of macrocytic anemia in a perinatal
common marmoset.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 7-year-old female common marmoset showed clinical signs of
gradual weight loss and intermittent diarrhea beginning 3 months after giving
birth. Macrocytic anemia was diagnosed due to a decreased red blood cell (RBC)
count, low hemoglobin level, and increased mean corpuscular volume (MCV).
Multivitamins containing cobalamin and folate were administered for 7 days, and
the patient's RBC count recovered to near the normal range with this treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Macrocytic anemia can be diagnosed by evaluating the MCV on a
complete blood count (CBC) and cobalamin or folate levels and be treated by
supplementation with cobalamin and folate. Such supplements may be needed during 
pregnancy and lactation in female common marmosets and/or in animals with chronic
diarrhea.

The marmoset is becoming an important model for studies of primate vision, due to
factors such as its small body size, lissencephalic brain, short gestational
period and rapid postnatal development. For many studies of visual physiology
(including single-cell recordings), it is a requirement that the animal is
maintained under anaesthesia and neuromuscular block in order to ensure ocular
stability. However, maintaining such a small animal (290-400 g) in good
physiological condition for long periods requires expert attention. This becomes 
particularly important in the case of recordings from visual association cortex, 
where neuronal responses are known to be highly sensitive to factors such as the 
type and dose of anaesthetic, and the animal's physiological balance. The present
protocol summarises our laboratory's experience over the last decade in
developing a preparation for the study of marmoset visual cortex. It allows
excellent recording from extrastriate areas for periods of at least 48 h,
including the continuous study of isolated single cells for several hours.

The default mode network (DMN) is associated with a wide range of brain
functions. In humans, the DMN is marked by strong functional connectivity among
three core regions: medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), posterior parietal cortex
(PPC), and the medial parietal and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). Neuroimaging
studies have shown that the DMN also exists in non-human primates, suggesting
that it may be a conserved feature of the primate brain. Here, we found that, in 
common marmosets, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC; peak at A8aD) has
robust fMRI functional connectivity and reciprocal anatomical connections with
the posterior DMN core regions (PPC and PCC), while the mPFC has weak connections
with the posterior DMN core regions. This strong dlPFC but weak mPFC connectivity
in marmoset differs markedly from the stereotypical DMN in humans. The mPFC may
be involved in brain functions that are further developed in humans than in other
primates.

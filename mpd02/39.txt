Astrocytes play critical roles after brain injury, but their precise function is 
poorly defined. Utilizing single-nuclei transcriptomics to characterize
astrocytes after ischemic stroke in the visual cortex of the marmoset monkey, we 
observed nearly complete segregation between stroke and control astrocyte
clusters. Screening for the top 30 differentially expressed genes that might
limit stroke recovery, we discovered that a majority of astrocytes expressed
RTN4A/ NogoA, a neurite-outgrowth inhibitory protein previously only associated
with oligodendrocytes. NogoA upregulation on reactive astrocytes post-stroke was 
significant in both the marmoset and human brain, whereas only a marginal change 
was observed in mice. We determined that NogoA mediated an anti-inflammatory
response which likely contributes to limiting the infiltration of peripheral
macrophages into the surviving parenchyma.

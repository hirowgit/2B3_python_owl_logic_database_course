Language is a characteristic feature of human communication. Several familial
language impairments have been identified, and candidate genes for language
impairments already isolated. Studies comparing expression patterns of these
genes in human brain are necessary to further understanding of these genes.
However, it is difficult to examine gene expression in human brain. In this
study, we used a non-human primate (common marmoset; Callithrix jacchus) as a
biological model of the human brain to investigate expression patterns of human
speech- and reading-related genes. Expression patterns of speech disorder-
(FoxP2, FoxP1, CNTNAP2, and CMIP) and dyslexia- (ROBO1, DCDC2, and KIAA0319)
related genes were analyzed. We found the genes displayed overlapping expression 
patterns in the ocular, auditory, and motor systems. Our results enhance
understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying language impairments.

Four novel zaragozic acids, F-10863A, B, C and D, were isolated from a culture
broth of the fungus Mollisia sp. SANK 10294. F-10863 compounds contain a
4,6,7-trihydroxy-2,8-dioxyobicyclo-[3.2.1]octane-3,4,5-tricarboxyl ic acid core
like previously reported zaragozic acids, but the structures of the side chains
are different. Recently, it was found that F-10863A is identical to zaragozic
acid D3, while the other three are novel compounds. F-10863 compounds are potent 
inhibitors of squalene synthase like previously reported zaragozic acids, and,
furthermore, they exhibit serum cholesterol-lowering activity in vivo.

A 5-y-old multiparous female common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) presented with 
acute weight loss of approximately 25% over a 1-wk period. An abdominal mass was 
apparent on physical examination, and radiographs suggested peritoneal effusion. 
Exploratory laparotomy revealed hemoperitoneum and an enlarged, gray,
hemorrhaging uterus; ovariohysterectomy was performed, and the marmoset
recovered. Histologic evaluation of the ovaries and uterus revealed uterine
rupture, with invasion of placental villi lined by trophoblasts through the
myometrium to the serosal layer. Primary uterine rupture is a rare but serious
obstetric event in humans and has been reported only rarely in NHP. This report
is the first description of primary uterine rupture during early pregnancy in a
common marmoset.

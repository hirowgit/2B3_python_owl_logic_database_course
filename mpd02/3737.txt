BACKGROUND: 2-(Fluoromethoxy)-1,1,3,3,3-pentafluoro-1-propene (compound A) is a
fluorinated alkene formed by the degradation of sevoflurane in the anesthesia
circuit. Compound A is toxic to the kidneys in rats and undergoes
glutathione-dependent metabolism in vivo. Several nephrotoxic halogenated alkenes
also undergo cysteine conjugate beta-lyase-dependent biotransformation. These
experiments were designed to test the hypothesis that cysteine S-conjugates of
compound A undergo beta-lyase-dependent biotransformation.
METHODS: S-[2-(Fluoromethoxy)-1,1,3,3,3-pentafluoropropyl]-L-cysteine 4,
S-[2-(fluoromethoxy)-1,3,3,3-tetrafluoro-1-propenyl]-L-cysteine 5, and
S-(2-chloro-1,1,2-trifluoroethyl)-L-cysteine 11 were incubated with rat, human,
and nonhuman primate (cynomolgus, rhesus, and marmoset) kidney cytosol and
mitochondria. beta-Lyase activity was determined by measuring pyruvate formation.
RESULTS: Compound A-derived conjugates 4 and 5 as well as conjugate 11, a
positive control, were substrates for cytosolic and mitochondrial beta-lyase from
human, nonhuman primate, and rat kidney. For all substrates, beta-lyase activity 
was highest in the rat and lowest in the human and was higher in cytosol than in 
mitochondria. Conjugate 11 was a much better substrate than conjugates 4 or 5.
The biotransformation of conjugates 4, 5, and 11 was inhibited by the beta-lyase 
inhibitor (aminooxy)acetic acid and was stimulated by the amino group acceptor
2-keto-4-methylthiolbutyric acid, indicating a role for beta-lyase.
CONCLUSIONS: These data confirm the presence of beta-lyase activity in human and 
rat kidney and show that activity is also present in kidney tissue from nonhuman 
primates. The data also show that compound A-derived conjugates 4 and 5 undergo
beta-lyase-catalyzed biotransformation. beta-Lyase activity in rat and nonhuman
primate kidney tissue was 8 to 30 times and one- to three times, respectively,
higher than in human kidney tissue.

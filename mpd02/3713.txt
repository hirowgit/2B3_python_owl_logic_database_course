The hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus and the thalamic pregeniculate nucleus
(which includes the intergeniculate leaflet) comprise the circadian visual system
in the primate brain. In this study, we used intraocular injections of cholera
toxin subunit B to identify those nuclei in the common marmoset brain, and
demonstrated that calbindin D-28k immunoreactivity apparently labels most neurons
in both the suprachiasmatic and pregeniculate nuclei. These data suggest that
calbindin D-28k could represent a reliable neuronal marker for structures of the 
circadian visual system in marmosets and provide anatomical information on the
primate equivalent of the rodent intergeniculate leaflet.

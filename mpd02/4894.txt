An ethogram of the common marmoset (Calithrix jacchus jacchus): general
behavioural repertoire.

Stevenson MF, Poole TB.

The behavioural repertoire of four captive breeding pairs of Callithrix jacchus
jacchus is described. Social communication took the form of postures, facial
expressions, vocalizations and piloerection displays. Detailed analyses were made
of piloerection displays, adult play, copulatory, aggressive, and prey-catching
behaviour. Aggressive behaviour was uncommon in adult mated pairs. Play between
adults showed a degree of temporal of temporal organization. Vocalizations were
the main methods of intragroup communication whilst piloerection displays were
directed towards members of other groups and also to unfamiliar objects. The
behavioural repertoire of C. jacchus jacchus is compared with that of other
Primates.

Sequences of the epsilon-globin gene were determined for five species of
marmosets, along with approximately 2 kb of 5' flanking sequence. An analysis of 
these data, compared with those of other primates strongly supports the
classification of Callithrix jacchus and C. geoffroyi into the jacchus group, and
C. argentata and C. mauesi into the argentata group. The pygmy marmoset, formerly
identified as Cebuella pygmaea joined strongly to the argentata group, indicating
that without the pygmy marmoset the genus Callithrix would be paraphyletic. Our
data support recent studies which indicate that C. pygmaea should be included in 
the genus Callithrix. Relationships among other primates were as indicated by
previous studies of epsilon-globin sequences. Divergence times were estimated
according to a local molecular clock. These calculations indicated the divergence
of C. mauesi and C. argentata to be approximately 1.6-1.9 Myr (million years
ago), and the most recent common ancestor of the marmosets to be between 4.5 and 
4.7 Myr. The latter estimate corresponds well to the date of 4.6 Myr calculated
from an independent data set.

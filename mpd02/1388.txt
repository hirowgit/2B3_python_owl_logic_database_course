BACKGROUND: Common marmosets are known to develop an IgM glomerulopathy, which
has been linked with 'wasting marmoset' syndrome. This study investigated renal
pathology in a colony of marmosets, with and without weight loss.
METHODS: Renal histology, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy were
performed on marmosets euthanized for research or for weight loss. Serum and
urine biochemistry were measured during life and at euthanasia.
RESULTS: Histology from 25 adult marmosets (19 research and 6 weight loss) showed
mesangial expansion in the majority of glomeruli. Mesangial changes correlated
with electron-dense deposits and IgM deposition by immunofluorescence; negligible
other pathology was seen. Glomerular basement membrane thickness appeared
increased compared to reported human measurements. Low-grade proteinuria was
present in all animals, but did not progress. Renal function was normal in all
animals.
CONCLUSIONS: Marmosets develop a glomerulopathy characterized by mesangial
expansion, IgM deposition, and proteinuria. This is a benign occurrence and not
specifically associated with weight loss.

The protein-binding characteristics of the angiotensin II receptor antagonist
valsartan were determined in vitro by equilibrium dialysis, using 14C-labeled
valsartan with serum from healthy donors, plasma from patients who had received
valsartan, serum or plasma from animals, and purified human plasma proteins. The 
binding of valsartan was high (96 +/- 2%) in human serum at concentrations
ranging from 0.05 micrograms/mL to 5 micrograms/mL. A comparable extent of
binding (85-99%) was recorded in plasma from patients after repeated
administration of valsartan. Albumin (binding 92%) is the main protein involved
in the binding to plasma proteins, while the binding to alpha 1-acid glycoprotein
was low (22%) and to gamma globulins, negligible. Although highly bound,
valsartan was not displaced in vitro by hydrochlorothiazide, diclofenac,
furosemide, and warfarin. A high extent of binding was found in rat, dog, and
rabbit serum and in marmoset plasma, while a lower binding was found in mouse
serum.

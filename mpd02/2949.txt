The use of a puzzle-feeder, as feeding enrichment, was investigated in three
families of captive common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus). The study was carried 
out as a simultaneous choice test between two cages: one contained the
puzzle-feeder, the other contained the usual food dishes, but otherwise both were
arranged similarly. The monkeys were allowed to choose whether to feed from the
usual dishes, or from the puzzle-feeder which required more effort. They were
observed for two sessions in which they were differently motivated to feed. The
enriched cage was always visited first, the marmosets managed to extract food
from the puzzle-feeder, and spent more time eating from the puzzle-feeder when
less hungry. These data contribute to a wider understanding on the use, and the
effects, of feeding enrichments with different captive non-human primates.

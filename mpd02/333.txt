In recent studies performed in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine
(MPTP)-lesioned marmoset model of Parkinson's disease (PD), we have demonstrated 
that activation of the metabotropic glutamate 2 (mGlu2) receptor with the
orthosteric agonist (OA) LY-354,740 and the positive allosteric modulator (PAM)
LY-487,379 is effective at alleviating both dyskinesia and psychosis-like
behaviours (PLBs) triggered by the administration of L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine
(L-DOPA). Because mGlu2 OAs and PAMs bind to different sites on the receptor, we 
hypothesised that greater reductions of dyskinesia and PLBs would be obtained
upon concurrent administration of LY-354,740 and LY-487,379. In experiments
performed in six MPTP-lesioned marmosets, we administered LY-354,740 (0.1 mg/kg),
LY-487,379 (1 mg/kg), LY-354,740 (0.1 mg/kg) + LY-487,379 (1 mg/kg), or vehicle, 
in combination with L-DOPA and determined the effect of each treatment on
dyskinesia, PLBs, and parkinsonism. When compared to vehicle, LY-354,740 and
LY-487,379, administered alone or concurrently, significantly reduced dyskinesia.
The combination LY-354,740 + LY-487,379 provided mild additional benefit when
compared to LY-487,379 alone, but not compared to LY-354,740. For PLBs, when
compared to vehicle treatment, LY-354,740, LY-487,379, and combination thereof
all alleviated the abnormal behaviours, but the combination
LY-354,740 + LY-487,379 did not provide greater relief than either drug alone.
The anti-parkinsonian effect of L-DOPA was not altered by any of the treatments. 
Our results provide further evidence that mGlu2 activation might be a novel
approach to treat L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia and dopaminergic psychosis in PD.
However, they do not suggest that greater therapeutic effect would be achieved
upon combining an mGlu2 OA and an mGlu2 PAM.

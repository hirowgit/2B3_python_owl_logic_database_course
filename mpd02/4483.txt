The karotype of Saguinus midas niger was studied by G-, C-, and nuclear organizer
region (NOR)-banding techniques. Variations in C-banding patterns were observed
in some chromosomes. The banding patterns obtained were compared with those
previously described for Callithrix jacchus. The two species differ by a
reciprocal translocation involving pairs 9 and 16; by a paracentric inversion in 
chromosomes 1, 13, 14, 18, and 22; and by a pericentric inversion in at least
four subtelocentric pairs (chromosomes 19, 20, 21, and 22), dislocating the
nucleolar organizer region from the small short arm in C. jacchus to the proximal
segment of the long arm in S. m. niger (or vice versa). The amount of
constitutive heterochromatin is greater in S. m. niger than in C. jacchus,
especially in chromosomes 4, 7, and 14. The Y chromosome is smaller in C. jacchus
than in S. m. niger.

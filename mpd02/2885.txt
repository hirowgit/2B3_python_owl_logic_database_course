The first author trained 12 laboratory-housed common marmosets (Callithrix
jacchus) in pairs to assess the practicality of positive reinforcement training
as a technique in the management of these nonhuman animals. Behaviors taught were
(a) target training to allow in homecage weighing and (b) providing urine
samples. Between 2 to 13, 10-minute training sessions established desired
behaviors. Training aggressive animals only after they had been fed eliminated
aggression during training. Trained animals proved extremely reliable, and data
collection using trained animals was considerably faster than collection using
current laboratory techniques. The results suggest that positive reinforcement
training is a practical option in the management of laboratory-housed marmosets.

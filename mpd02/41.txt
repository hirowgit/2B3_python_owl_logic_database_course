The spontaneous object recognition (SOR) task is one of the most widely used
behavioral protocols to assess visual memory in animals. However, only recently
was it shown that nonhuman primates also perform well on this task. Here we
further characterized this new monkey recognition memory test by assessing the
performance of adult marmosets after an acute systemic administration of two
putative amnesic agents: the competitive muscarinic acetylcholine receptor
antagonist scopolamine (SCP; 0.05 mg/kg) and the noncompetitive
N-methyl-d-aspartate glutamate receptor antagonist MK-801 (0.015 mg/kg). We also 
determined whether the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor donepezil (DNP;
0.50 mg/kg), a clinically-used cognitive enhancer, reverses memory deficits
caused by either drug. The subjects had an initial 10 min sample trial where two 
identical neutral objects could be explored. After a 6 h retention interval,
recognition was based on an exploratory preference for a new rather than familiar
object during a 10 min test trial. Both SCP and MK-801 impaired the marmosets'
performance on the SOR task, as both objects were explored equivalently.
Co-administration of 0.50 mg/kg of DNP reversed the SCP- but not the
MK-801-induced memory deficit. These results indicate that cholinergic and
glutamatergic pathways mediate object recognition memory in the monkey SOR task.

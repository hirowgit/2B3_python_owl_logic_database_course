INTRODUCTION: QT intervals are strongly influenced by preceeding heart rate
history and are also characterized by rate-independent variability, leading to
difficulty in precise rate-correction of the raw QT interval. The present study
elucidates a novel analytical method that effectively addresses this problematic 
phenomenon in telemetered common marmosets.
METHODS: ECGs were collected from telemetered common marmosets (male and female) 
and analyzed by computerized algorithms. Descriptive statistics were calculated
from the mean of QT intervals for 5-ms increments of RR. The QT interval was
corrected for the RR interval by applying Bazett's, Fridericia's, and individual 
probabilistic QT rate-correction formulae.
RESULTS: The linear regression of log-transformed QT and RR intervals derived
from a probabilistic approach yielded a well-correlated QT-RR fit. Assessed as
the slope of the QTc-RR interval, application of individual probabilistic QT
rate-corrections resulted in the most effective dissociation of the effects of
rate from the raw QT interval, compared to generic rate-correction formulae.
Using individual corrections, the QTc was stable while the interquartile range
(IQR) of the QTc distribution was stable, spanning 5-10 ms for each subject over 
all physiological RR intervals. Heart rate variability distributions were
centered about unity during both photoperiods and sinus arrhythmia was far less
pronounced compared with measurements in dogs.
DISCUSSION: Probabilistic QT rate-correction eliminated the confounding effects
of heart rate and provided a stable QTc baseline. These results indicate that
application of this method of analysis in telemetered common marmosets results in
a high degree of sensitivity for the consistent detection of small (5-10 ms)
changes in the QTc interval.

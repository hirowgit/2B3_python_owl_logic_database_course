Several applications of pluripotent stem cell (PSC)-derived cardiomyocytes
require elimination of undifferentiated cells. A major limitation for
cardiomyocyte purification is the lack of easy and specific cell marking
techniques. We found that a fluorescent dye that labels mitochondria,
tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester perchlorate, could be used to selectively mark 
embryonic and neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, as well as mouse, marmoset and human
PSC-derived cardiomyocytes, and that the cells could subsequently be enriched
(>99% purity) by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Purified cardiomyocytes
transplanted into testes did not induce teratoma formation. Moreover, aggregate
formation of PSC-derived cardiomyocytes through homophilic cell-cell adhesion
improved their survival in the immunodeficient mouse heart. Our approaches will
aid in the future success of using PSC-derived cardiomyocytes for basic and
clinical applications.

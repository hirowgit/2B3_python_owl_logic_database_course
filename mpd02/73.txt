Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a multifactorial disorder with characteristic
synaptic and gene expression changes. Early intervention during childhood is
thought to benefit prognosis. Here, we examined the changes in cortical
synaptogenesis, synaptic function, and gene expression from birth to the juvenile
stage in a marmoset model of ASD induced by valproic acid (VPA) treatment. Early 
postnatally, synaptogenesis was reduced in this model, while juvenile-age
VPA-treated marmosets showed increased synaptogenesis, similar to observations in
human tissue. During infancy, synaptic plasticity transiently increased and was
associated with altered vocalization. Synaptogenesis-related genes were
downregulated early postnatally. At three months of age, the differentially
expressed genes were associated with circuit remodeling, similar to the
expression changes observed in humans. In summary, we provide a functional and
molecular characterization of a non-human primate model of ASD, highlighting its 
similarity to features observed in human ASD.

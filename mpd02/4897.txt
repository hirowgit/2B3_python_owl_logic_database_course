Histochemical differences between the major salivary glands of the marmosets
(Callithrix jacchus and Callithrix penicillata).

Miraglia T, Moura CS, Santos AJ.

Histoenzymologic differences between the parotid, paramandibular and
submandibular glands were studied in six Callithrix jacchus (four males and two
females) and four Callithrix penicillata (three males and one female). The
acinous cells of the paramandibular glands showed a stronger reactivity for the
diaphorases (NADH2-TR and NADPH2-TR) and for a certain group of enzymes of the
carbohydrate metabolism (F-1-6P Ald, LDH, ADH, G-6-PDH and 6-PGDH), lipid
metabolism (alpha-GPDH, beta-OHBDH, alkaline phosphatase and acid phosphatase),
protein metabolism (alanyl aminopeptidase, leucine aminopeptidase and GDH) and
respiratory chain (cris-aconitase and ICDH). The nonspecific esterase was more
reactive in the basal part of of the mucous cells of the submandibular glands.
Conversely, some enzymes of the respiratory chain (SDH, cytochrome oxidase and
ATPases) showed a stronger reactivity in the serous cells of the parotid and
submandibular glands. The paramandibular glands exhibited a lesser autonomic
innervation than the parotid and submandibular.

Literature studies have demonstrated the structural, connectional, and functional
differences between cortical folding patterns in mammalian brains, such as convex
and concave patterns. However, the molecular underpinning of such convex/concave 
differences remains largely unknown. Thanks to public access to a recently
released set of marmoset whole-brain in situ hybridization data by RIKEN, Japan; 
this data's accessibility empowers us to improve our understanding of the
organization, regulation, and function of genes and their relation to macroscale 
metrics of brains. In this work, magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor 
imaging macroscale neuroimaging data in this dataset were used to delineate
convex/concave patterns in marmoset and to examine their structural features.
Machine learning and visualization tools were employed to investigate the
possible transcriptome difference between cortical convex and concave patterns.
Experimental results demonstrated that a collection of genes is differentially
expressed in convex and concave patterns, and their expression profiles can
robustly characterize and differentiate the two folding patterns. More
importantly, neuroscientific interpretations of these differentially expressed
genes, as well as axonal guidance pathway analysis and gene enrichment analysis, 
offer novel understanding of structural and functional differences between
cortical folding patterns in different regions from a molecular perspective.

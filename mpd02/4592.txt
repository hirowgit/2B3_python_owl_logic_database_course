Sulphoxidation of S-carboxymethyl-L-cysteine in the rhesus monkey (Macaca
mulatta), cynomologus monkey (Macaca fascicularis), African green monkey
(Cercopithecus aethiops) and the marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).

The metabolic pathways giving rise to the urinary metabolites of
S-carboxymethyl-L-cysteine have been identified for the rhesus, cynomologus,
African green and marmoset species of monkey. The formation of a sulphoxide
metabolite from the sulphide precursor is a reaction important in these species. 
The metabolic profile displayed by the marmoset was distinct from the three Old
World species, with the rhesus and cynomologus being similar to man.

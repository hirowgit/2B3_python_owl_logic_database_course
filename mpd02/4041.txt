Integrated Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was found in 4 of 17 pathologically
diagnosed, EBV-positive nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) biopsy samples using pulse
field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The analyses were carried out after digestion
of biopsy DNA with rare restriction enzymes such as PacI, which does not cleave
EBV due to the absence of the recognition sequence, and ClaI. Employing this
technique, EBV integration in IB4, through EcoI, and Namalwa through the terminal
repeats, was confirmed. We also established that integration of EBV in AW Ramos
was through the terminal repeats. The Raji cell line was also found to harbour
integrated virus in addition to episomal DNA. However, the site of integration
could not be confirmed, since as the Raji DNA appeared to be heavily methylated
and could not be cleaved with CPG rare cutters. As in the Raji cell line, the DNA
of EBV in nasopharyngeal-carcinoma (NPC) biopsies also appeared to be methylated.

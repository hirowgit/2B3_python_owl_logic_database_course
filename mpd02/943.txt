Despite the success of cochlear implants (CIs) in human populations, most users
perform poorly in noisy environments and music and tonal language perception. How
CI devices engage the brain at the single neuron level has remained largely
unknown, in particular in the primate brain. By comparing neuronal responses with
acoustic and CI stimulation in marmoset monkeys unilaterally implanted with a CI 
electrode array, we discovered that CI stimulation was surprisingly ineffective
at activating many neurons in auditory cortex, particularly in the hemisphere
ipsilateral to the CI. Further analyses revealed that the CI-nonresponsive
neurons were narrowly tuned to frequency and sound level when probed with
acoustic stimuli; such neurons likely play a role in perceptual behaviors
requiring fine frequency and level discrimination, tasks that CI users find
especially challenging. These findings suggest potential deficits in central
auditory processing of CI stimulation and provide important insights into factors
responsible for poor CI user performance in a wide range of perceptual
tasks.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The cochlear implant (CI) is the most successful
neural prosthetic device to date and has restored hearing in hundreds of
thousands of deaf individuals worldwide. However, despite its huge successes, CI 
users still face many perceptual limitations, and the brain mechanisms involved
in hearing through CI devices remain poorly understood. By directly comparing
single-neuron responses to acoustic and CI stimulation in auditory cortex of
awake marmoset monkeys, we discovered that neurons unresponsive to CI stimulation
were sharply tuned to frequency and sound level. Our results point out a major
deficit in central auditory processing of CI stimulation and provide important
insights into mechanisms underlying the poor CI user performance in a wide range 
of perceptual tasks.

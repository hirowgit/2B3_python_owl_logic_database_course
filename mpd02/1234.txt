Two groups of pygmy marmoset (Cebuella pygmaea) were rescued along the left bank 
of the Madeira River during the formation of Santo Antônio Hydroelectric Dam
reservoir in the state of Rondônia, Northern Brazil. Reintroduction of both
groups occurred in areas of open Tropical rainforest located within the project´s
Permanent Preservation Area. A post-release monitoring was conducted for three
months using radio-telemetry. Individuals of each group remained together and
settled in stable home ranges near their respective release sites. The mortality 
rate of translocated animals was about 7%. This seems to be the first report
documenting the complete group translocation of C. pygmaea and the first to
successfully employ radio-telemetry techniques in monitoring this species. This
study demonstrated the feasibility of translocation and the use of
radio-telemetry in monitoring C. pygmaea.

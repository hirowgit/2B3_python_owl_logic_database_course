The common marmoset is a non-human primate that has increasingly employed in the 
biomedical research including the fields of neuroscience and behavioral studies. 
Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D has been speculated to be involved in psycho-neurologic 
actions in the human brain. In the present study, to clarify the role of CYP2D in
the marmoset brain, we investigated the expression patterns of CYP2D mRNA in the 
brain using in situ hybridization (ISH). In addition, to identify the gene
location of CYP2D19, a well-studied CYP2D isoform in the common marmoset, a
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) study was performed. Consistent with
findings for the human brain, CYP2D mRNA was localized in the neuronal cells of
different brain regions; e.g., the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, substantia
nigra, and cerebellum. FISH analysis showed that the CYP2D19 gene was located on 
chromosome 1q, which is homologous to human chromosome 22 on which the CYP2D6
gene exists. These results suggest that CYP2D in the marmoset brain may play the 
same role as human CYP2D6 in terms of brain actions, and that the CYP2D19 gene is
conserved in a syntenic manner. Taken together, these findings suggest that the
common marmoset is a useful model for studying psychiatric disorders related to
CYP2D dysfunction in the brain.

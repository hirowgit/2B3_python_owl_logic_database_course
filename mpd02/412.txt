The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a non-human primate that provides
valuable models for neuroscience and aging research due to its anatomical
similarities to humans and relatively short lifespan. This study was carried out 
to examine whether aged marmosets develop glaucoma, as seen in humans. We found
that 11% of the aged marmosets presented with glaucoma-like characteristics; this
incident rate is very similar to that in humans. Magnetic resonance imaging
showed a significant volume loss in the visual cortex, and histological analyses 
confirmed the degeneration of the lateral geniculate nuclei and visual cortex in 
the affected marmosets. These marmosets did not have elevated intraocular
pressure, but showed an increased oxidative stress level, low cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF) pressure, and low brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and TrkB
expression in the retina, optic nerve head and CSF. Our findings suggest that
marmosets have potential to provide useful information for the research of eye
and the visual system.

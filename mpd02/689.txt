Two-photon imaging in behaving animals has revealed neuronal activities related
to behavioral and cognitive function at single-cell resolution. However,
marmosets have posed a challenge due to limited success in training on motor
tasks. Here we report the development of protocols to train head-fixed common
marmosets to perform upper-limb movement tasks and simultaneously perform
two-photon imaging. After 2-5 months of training sessions, head-fixed marmosets
can control a manipulandum to move a cursor to a target on a screen. We conduct
two-photon calcium imaging of layer 2/3 neurons in the motor cortex during this
motor task performance, and detect task-relevant activity from multiple neurons
at cellular and subcellular resolutions. In a two-target reaching task, some
neurons show direction-selective activity over the training days. In a short-term
force-field adaptation task, some neurons change their activity when the force
field is on. Two-photon calcium imaging in behaving marmosets may become a
fundamental technique for determining the spatial organization of the cortical
dynamics underlying action and cognition.

The brains of four 2-week-old marmoset monkeys were perfusion-fixed immediately
after bicuculline-induced seizures lasting 1.5-4.3 h and were later examined by
light and electron microscopy. Mean arterial blood pressure and rectal
temperature measurements during seizures did not differ significantly from
baseline. Plasma glucose concentrations decreased to the 1.5 mM range at the end 
of seizures, and arterial pH and bicarbonate were lower than in control animals, 
although arterial pO2 and pCO2 were maintained. Neuropathological changes were
minimal. Swollen astrocytic processes surrounded some capillaries and some
neurons in cerebral cortex, hippocampus, putamen and thalamus. Almost all the
neurons examined looked normal, but mitochondrial swelling was present in a few. 
All but the most severe mitochondrial swelling, which occurred very rarely in one
of four animals, is potentially reversible. The virtual absence of neuronal
necrosis in these neonatal monkeys is consistent with the resistance to
seizure-induced brain damage found in immature rats, and stands in sharp contrast
to the damage seen in older animals. Lack of neuronal damage, however, does not
rule out potential adverse effects of prolonged seizure activity on subsequent
brain growth and development.

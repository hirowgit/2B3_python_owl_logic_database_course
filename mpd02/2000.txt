In the human, canonical histones are largely replaced by protamine 1 (P1) and
protamine 2 (P2) during late spermatogenesis. Recent studies have demonstrated
that abnormal replacement of the histones is associated with severe male
infertility and has profound implications for early embryogenesis. In this review
the hispid cotton rat and the common marmoset are evaluated as animal models for 
the study of chromatin packaging in sperm. The DNA sequences of protamine 1 and
protamine 2 in the cotton rat are also reported. We have found that the P1 and P2
genes share a 64% and 56% amino acid identity with human, respectively. The
hispid cotton rat expresses both protamines, has a similar P1:P2 ratio, and a
gene sequence homologous to human, thus making it a possible model organism for
chromatin studies. The common marmoset also expresses both protamine genes and
has a very similar spermatogenetic characteristic to man. This review considers
both animals as possible models to study the mechanisms of protamine regulation
and the effects of altered expression caused by environmental or physiological
perturbations.

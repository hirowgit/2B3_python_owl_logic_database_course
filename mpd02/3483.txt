Monoamine oxidase (MAO) has two subtypes, A and B, that have different
distributions between the rodent and the human. In the striatum, dopamine (DA) of
the rat seems to be metabolized by MAO A, and DA of the human is largely
deaminated by MAO B. MAO in the striatum of common marmosets is also type B.
Using in vivo microdialysis, we investigated the pharmacological activity of
selegiline, a selective irreversible inhibitor of MAO B, in the striatum of
marmosets. Intraperitoneal co-administration of selegiline (1 mg kg-1, i.p.) with
levodopa/carbidopa (10/2.5 mg kg-1, i.p.) did not significantly increase
extracellular concentration of DA in the striatum of common marmosets compared
with control animals receiving levodopa/carbidopa alone. Daily pretreatment with 
0.1 mg kg-1 (i.p.) selegiline for two weeks, however, dramatically increased
extracellular concentration of DA to about seven times that of control animals
treated with levodopa/carbidopa alone in marmosets. Such an increase in
extracellular concentrations of DA could not be observed in a similar study with 
Wistar rats. This study showed that chronic administration of a small dose of
selegiline caused a marked increase in extracellular DA concentration in the
striatum of primates, but not in the rodents.

BACKGROUND: Current knowledge about the optimal energy and nutrient supply for
common marmoset monkeys (Callithrix jacchus) is scarce, and more information is
needed for establishing the underlying nutritional concepts for facilitating
longevity of this species as laboratory animals for biomedical research.
METHODS: Two feeding experiments were conducted to yield fundamental data about
feed acceptance, real feed intake, and feed preferences under laboratory
conditions. Newly developed feeding concepts for marmoset monkeys were also
examined in preliminary investigations to compare the outcomes with those of a
commercial pelletized mixed feed.
RESULTS: The first experiments showed preferences for main protein sources in the
diets studied, specifically that plant proteins are more accepted than fish meal 
or egg protein as the main protein source. Several aroma supplements did not
modify the acceptance and feed intake markedly.
CONCLUSIONS: The newly developed feeding concept yielded promising preliminary
data for long-term studies of energy and nutrient supply under laboratory
conditions. However, studies of the fundamental requirements are still needed.

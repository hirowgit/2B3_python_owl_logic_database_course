Retinal projections in vertebrates reach the primary visual, accessory optic, and
circadian timing structures. The central feature of the circadian timing system
is the principal circadian pacemaker, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the
hypothalamus. The direct projections from the retina to the SCN are considered
the entrainment pathway of the circadian timing system. In this study, unilateral
intravitreal injections of cholera toxin subunit B were used to trace the retinal
projections to the marmoset hypothalamus. The retinohypothalamic tract reaches
the ventral suprachiasmatic nucleus bilaterally, as anticipated from previous
studies. However, labeled fibers were found in several other hypothalamic
regions, such as the medial and lateral preoptic areas, supraoptic nucleus,
anterior and lateral hypothalamic areas, retrochiasmatic area, and
subparaventricular zone. These results reveal new aspects of retinohypothalamic
projection in primates and are discussed in terms of their implications for
circadian as well as noncircadian control systems.

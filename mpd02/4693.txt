Reproductive status of adult daughters in family groups of common marmosets
(Callithrix jacchus jacchus).

Evans S, Hodges JK.

Urine samples were collected from 6 pubertal female common marmosets at
approximately 3-day intervals over a period of 3-7 months. All 6 females were the
eldest daughters in their family groups. 3 of these females were subsequently
removed from their families and sampled in isolation for another 2-3 months.
Levels of urinary pregnanediol-3 alpha-glucuronide were measured by
radioimmunoassay in order to establish whether these females showed ovarian
cyclicity. No cyclical fluctuations in the levels of pregnanediol were observed
in the females housed with their families even though the females were of a
reproductively mature age. Cyclicity was quickly established (within 18-22 days) 
when the females were removed from the family. These results are discussed in the
light of similar recent investigations on callitrichid reproduction and the
behavioural implications are considered.

In this study, the alpha-globin 3' HVR (Jarman et al., 1986), the RNA transcripts
of 33.15 and 33.6 (Carter et al., 1989), and the human locus-specific
minisatellites MS1, MS8, MS31, MS32 (Wong et al., 1987), MS51, MS228A (Armour et 
al., 1989) and g3 (Wong et al., 1986) were applied to domestic pigs, common
marmoset monkeys (Callithrix jacchus jacchus) and Waldrapp ibises (Geronticus
eremita) and evaluated for their suitability firstly for isolating polymorphic
VNTR markers from genomic libraries (pigs), and secondly for producing
informative DNA fingerprints (pigs, marmosets and Waldrapp ibises).

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is the cause of infectious mononucleosis and is
associated with a variety of life-threatening diseases in humans. Therefore the
development of an effective vaccine is an important objective. Many of the
initial studies of vaccine efficacy analyse the ability of vaccine preparations
to prevent the induction of lymphomas in cottontop tamarins by the B95-8 strain
of EBV. We used a vaccinia virus recombinant expressing gp340, vMA1, tested
previously in the cotton-top tamarin, to evaluate a common marmoset model in
which the challenge virus, M81, resembles more closely the wild-type strains of
EBV in the general population than does the standard B95-8 strain. We
characterised the M81 strain of EBV with respect to the sequence of its gp340/220
gene and in regard to the presence of a region deleted in B95-8. Replication of
the challenge virus in the group vaccinated with vMA1 was decreased when compared
to control groups.

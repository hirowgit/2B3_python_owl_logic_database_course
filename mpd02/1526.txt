The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is now widely used in various research
fields, including toxicology. However, information about the background pathology
of this species is scarce. Here, we report a case of rhabdomyosarcoma that
spontaneously occurred in a common marmoset. A 44-month-old male common marmoset 
was euthanized due to bilateral hind limb paralysis. At necropsy, a 2×2×5-cm
intramuscular mass was observed in the lower right back. Histologically, the mass
was mainly composed of interlacing bundles of spindle-shaped tumor cells.
Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were positive for myogenin, desmin,
vimentin and alpha-smooth muscle actin. Ultrastructurally, the tumor cells
contained bundles of myofilaments with Z-band-like structures. Thus, the tumor
was diagnosed as a rhabdomyosarcoma. To our knowledge, this is the first report
of spontaneous rhabdomyosarcoma that was definitely diagnosed in the common
marmoset.

Objects constitute the fundamental currency of our consciousness: they are the
things that we perceive, remember and think about. One of the most important
objects for a primate is a face. Research on the macaque face patch system in
recent years has given us a remarkable window into the detailed processes
underlying object recognition. Here, we review the macaque face patch system,
including its anatomical organization, coding principles, role in behaviour and
interactions with other brain regions. We highlight not only how it constitutes
an archetypal object recognition system but also how it may provide a key to
understanding mechanisms for higher cognitive function.

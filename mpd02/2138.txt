The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is increasingly attractive for use as a 
non-human primate animal model in biomedical research. It has a relatively high
reproduction rate for a primate, making it potentially suitable for transgenic
modification. Although several attempts have been made to produce non-human
transgenic primates, transgene expression in the somatic tissues of live infants 
has not been demonstrated by objective analyses such as polymerase chain reaction
with reverse transcription or western blots. Here we show that the injection of a
self-inactivating lentiviral vector in sucrose solution into marmoset embryos
results in transgenic common marmosets that expressed the transgene in several
organs. Notably, we achieved germline transmission of the transgene, and the
transgenic offspring developed normally. The successful creation of transgenic
marmosets provides a new animal model for human disease that has the great
advantage of a close genetic relationship with humans. This model will be
valuable to many fields of biomedical research.

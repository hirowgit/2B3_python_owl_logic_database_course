The impact of a foraging enrichment device, the "mealworm feeder," on the
behavior of the common marmoset was examined. In 3-h weekly exposures to the
wormfeeder device, behavioral observations were conducted to compare the rates of
feeder use, use of other enrichment devices, stereotyped behavior, and
inactivity, to those of control sessions in which the enrichment device was not
provided. Significantly decreased rates of pacing and time spent sitting still
were observed in association with placement of the mealworm feeder. Feeder use
declined over a period of 3 h, even if the feeders' contents were not fully
depleted, and the effects of enrichment on activity waned in a like fashion. Use 
of other enrichment devices, comprised primarily of cage furniture, increased in 
the presence of the mealworm feeder. This effect did not change significantly
over the 3 h of exposure even though use of the feeder declined. There was
significant variation in feeder use among sex and housing condition, with females
housed singly and in peer groups using the feeders significantly more than did
males, whereas subadults used the feeder significantly more often than did either
the dominant female or male in family groups. The results of this study suggest
that the mealworm feeder is an effective form of environmental enrichment for the
common marmoset, but interest wanes after approximately 3 h.

Acute and repeated exposure to cocaine alters the cognitive performance of humans
and animals. How each administration schedule affects the same memory task has
yet to be properly established in nonhuman primates. Therefore, we assessed the
performance of marmoset monkeys in a spontaneous object-location (SOL)
recognition memory task after acute and repeated exposure to cocaine (COC;
5mg/kg, ip). Two identical neutral stimuli were explored on the 10-min sample
trial, after which preferential exploration of the displaced vs the stationary
object was analyzed on the 10-min test trial. For the acute treatment, cocaine
was given immediately after the sample presentation, and spatial recognition was 
then tested after a 24-h interval. For the repeated exposure schedule, daily
cocaine injections were given on 7 consecutive days. After a 7-day drug-free
period, the SOL task was carried out with a 10-min intertrial interval. When
given acutely postsample, COC improved the marmosets' recognition memory, whereas
it had a detrimental effect after the repeated exposure. Thus, depending on the
administration schedule, COC exerted opposing effects on the marmosets' ability
to recognize spatial changes. This agrees with recent studies in rodents and the 
recognition impairment seen in human addicts. Further studies related to the
effects of cocaine's acute×prior drug history on the same cognitive domain are
warranted.

The corneal endothelia of 12 female common marmosets (age: 12-18 months) were
examined with a contact-type specular microscope under general anesthesia. The
specular microscopy showed uniform-sized, hexagonal endothelia arranged regularly
on the innermost layer of the cornea. The endothelial plane was smooth; however, 
it occasionally had irregular undulation or parallel folds. The cell density
(cells/mm2) in common marmosets was similar to that in cynomolgus monkeys.

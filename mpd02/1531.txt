BACKGROUND: This study aimed to establish reference values for selected
ophthalmic diagnostic tests in healthy neotropical primates from Salvador,
Brazil.
METHODS: A total of 73 intact adults, including Callithrix jacchus (n = 31),
Callithrix penicillata (n = 8), Cebus sp. (n = 22), and Cebus xanthosternos (n = 
9) were used to evaluate the normal conjunctival bacterial flora. Cebus
xanthosternos (n = 12) were used to evaluate tear production with Schirmer's tear
test (STT), intraocular pressure (IOP), and conjunctival cytology.
RESULTS: For all animals evaluated, Gram-positive bacteria were predominant.
Results of the diagnostic tests in Cebus xanthosternos were as follows: STT:
14.92 ± 5.46 mm/minutes, IOP: 19.62 ± 4.57 mmHg, and conjunctival cytology
revealed intermediate squamous epithelial cells in great quantities.
CONCLUSIONS: These ophthalmic reference values will be particularly useful to
diagnose discrete or unusual pathological changes in the neotropical primates
eye.

Callitrichid hepatitis (CH) is a highly fatal, emerging arenavirus disease of
captive South American marmosets and tamarins (Callitrichidae), including the
endangered golden lion tamarin. A common-source outbreak of CH in golden lion
tamarins and pygmy marmosets at a US zoo resulted from a single feeding of the
primates with newborn mice in apparently infected with lymphocytic
choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). Isolates from livers of mice and primates were
related to isolates from previous CH outbreaks and to laboratory strains of LCMV 
by serology and nucleic acid hybridization, and 2 surviving animals developed
antibody to other LCMVCH isolates and to laboratory strains of LCMV. Thus, LCMV, 
an arenavirus prevalent in wild mice in the US, can cause sporadic fatal hepatic 
disease in primates. Exposure of humans to wild or laboratory mice or to
marmosets and tamarins that are infected with wild-type strains of LCMV poses the
danger of serious disease.

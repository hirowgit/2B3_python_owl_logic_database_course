The fate of [35S]-phenothiazine, a veterinary anthelmintic, has been investigated
in the adult male marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) following oral administration. A 
near complete recovery of radioactivity (c. 95%) was achieved in 0-3 days, with
just over one-third of the dose (c. 37%) being present in the urine and the
remainder (c. 58%) being accounted for in the faeces. The majority of the urinary
radioactivity (c. 91%) was present as conjugates, tentatively identified as
phenothiazine N-glucuronide and leucophenothiazone sulphate. Smaller amounts of
phenothiazone, thionol, phenothiazine sulphoxide and unchanged phenothiazine were
also identified. The only compound identified in the faeces was unchanged
phenothiazine.

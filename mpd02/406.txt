Oxytocin (OXT) is an important neuromodulator of social behaviors via activation 
of both oxytocin receptors (OXTR) and vasopressin (AVP) 1a receptors (AVPR1a).
Marmosets areÂ neotropical primates with a modified OXT ligand (Pro8-OXT), and
this ligand shows significant coevolution with traits including social monogamy
and litter size. Pro8-OXT produces more potent and efficacious responses at
primate OXTR and stronger behavioral effects than the consensus mammalian OXT
ligand (Leu8-OXT). Here, we tested whether OXT/AVP ligands show differential
levels of crosstalk at primate AVPR1a. We measured binding affinities and Ca2+
signaling responses of AVP, Pro8-OXT and Leu8-OXT at human, macaque, and marmoset
AVPR1a. We found that AVP binds with higher affinity than OXT across AVPR1a, and 
marmoset AVPR1a show a 10-fold lower OXT binding affinity compared to human and
macaque AVPR1a. Both Leu8-OXT and Pro8-OXT produce a less efficacious response
than AVP at human AVPR1a and higher efficacious response than AVP at marmoset
AVPR1a. These data suggest that OXT might partially antagonize endogenous human
AVPR1a signaling and enhance marmoset AVPR1a signaling. These findings aid in
further understanding inconsistencies observed following systemic intranasal
administration of OXT and provide important insights into taxon-specific
differences in nonapeptide ligand/receptor coevolution and behavior.

Subcutaneous injection of the glucocorticoid dexamethasone in the primate
Callithrix jacchus increased the proportion of the macrophage subtype RM 3/1 in
the blood from a basic level of 16% positive monocytes to about 65%. The elevated
numbers of RM 3/1-positive cells were seen 24 and 72 h after application and were
independent of the dosages used (50 or 150 micrograms/kg). Oral administration
had no effect. CD4-, CD14- and CDw14-antigen expression of monocytes was not
influenced by the dexamethasone treatment. In tissues, e.g. spleen, thymus,
liver, skin and kidney, RM 3/1-positive macrophages revealed a similar
distribution as in human tissues but no differences in glucocorticoid treated to 
control animals could be observed. These results show that glucocorticoids induce
in the monkey Callithrix jacchus a distinct monocyte subtype similarly as in man 
while other macrophage phenotypes were not influenced.

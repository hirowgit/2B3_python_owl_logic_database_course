The dietary diversity of marmosets is substantial, which may reflect differences 
in their colour vision. This study examined the colour discrimination ability of 
a gummivore/insectivore callitrichid, Callithrix penicillata, which inhabits the 
Brazilian cerrado (bush savanna). A series of ecologically relevant tasks,
involving a behavioural paradigm of discrimination learning in semi-natural
conditions and the usage of ecologically relevant stimuli, was executed. Three
marmosets, 2 males and a female, behaved like human dichromats, showing an
impaired performance when orange and green stimuli had to be discriminated. In
contrast, 2 females resembled human trichromats, discriminating those kinds of
pairs. Our data suggest that Callithrix penicillata presents a polymorphic
trichromacy, with dichromatic males and dichromatic or trichromatic females.

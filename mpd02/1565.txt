BACKGROUND: Chromosomal analyses were performed for marmosets from two colonies -
Deutsches Primatenzentrum (DPZ) and Biomedical Primate Research Centre (BPRC).
Chlorine-based disinfectants are used in DPZ; no chemical disinfection is applied
in BPRC.
METHODS: The rates of chromosomal non-disjunction, polyploidy and
endoreduplication were investigated after G-banding.
RESULTS: For DPZ monkeys, the mean rates of non-disjunction were 7.6% for bone
marrow and 11.3% for lymphocytes. The polyploidy level was 2.5% in bone marrow
and 0.8% in blood. Frequency of endoreduplication in bone marrow and in
leucocytes was 0.5% and 0.8%, respectively. For BPRC, the rate of non-disjunction
in leucocytes (1.3%) was significantly lower than that for DPZ; the polyploidy
rate (0.2%) in blood was lower than that in DPZ; endoreduplication was not
observed.
CONCLUSION: The levels of chromosomal disorders are elevated for DPZ colony. We
suggest that the increased rate of chromosomal disorders in DPZ marmosets can be 
related to the chemical disinfection of their environment.

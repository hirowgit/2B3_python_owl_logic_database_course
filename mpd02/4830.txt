'Collaborative' rearing of marmoset triplets.

Hearn JP, Burden FJ.

A system of management is described in which all 3 offspring from triplet births 
to Callithrix jacchus can be successfully reared to weaning. Hand-rearing
techniques are applied to the offspring in turn without depriving them of the
maternal and family influences necessary for normal behavioural development.

Habitats, population densities and group sizes of 5 primate species (Callithrix
flaviceps, Callicebus personatus personatus, Cebus apella nigritus, Alouatta
fusca clamitans, and Brachyteles arachnoides) were estimated, using the method of
repeated transect sampling, in an area of montane pluvial forest in eastern
Brazil (Atlantic forest). A. fusca and C. apella had the highest densities in
terms of groups and individuals per square kilometer, respectively, while B.
arachnoides was least abundant. The highest primate densities were observed in
areas of secondary vegetation. Both group sizes and population densities for the 
5 species were generally lower at the Reserva Biologica Augusto Ruschi than those
reported in other areas of Atlantic forest. Hunting pressure and the different
carrying capacity of the habitat are suggested as possible causes for the low
number of sightings registered for these species.

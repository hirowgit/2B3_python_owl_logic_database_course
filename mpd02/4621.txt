Effects of oestradiol 17B, progesterone and testosterone upon proceptivity and
receptivity in ovariectomized common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus).

Kendrick KM, Dixson AF.

The sexual behaviour of eight pairs of marmosets was observed during blocks of 30
minute tests after the ovariectomized female partners were treated with
physiological doses of testosterone, oestradiol and progesterone. The effects of 
an intra-vaginal progesterone treatment were also investigated. Pre-ovulatory
levels of oestradiol significantly increased the females' proceptive and
receptive tongue-flicking displays and reduced the percentage of mounts refused. 
Mid-luteal levels of progesterone, by comparison, virtually abolished proceptive 
and receptive tongue-flicking and significantly increased mount refusals.
Testosterone treatment was without effect. Vaginal application of progesterone
unlike subcutaneous implantation of the hormone did not significantly alter the
females' sexual behaviour. These results indicate that central actions of
oestradiol and progesterone upon proceptivity and receptivity may occur in this
primate, although further research using intra-cranial implants of these steroids
is required to test this hypothesis.

Parallel visual pathways originate at the first synapse in the retina, where
cones make connections with cone bipolar cells that in turn contact ganglion
cells. There are more ganglion cell types than bipolar types, suggesting that
there must be divergence from bipolar to ganglion cells. Here we analyze the
contacts between an OFF bipolar type (DB3a) and six ganglion cell types in the
retina of the marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus). Ganglion cells were
transfected via particle-mediated gene transfer of an expression plasmid for the 
postsynaptic density 95-green fluorescent protein (PSD95-GFP), and DB3a cells
were labeled via immunohistochemistry. Ganglion cell types that fully or
partially costratified with DB3a cells included OFF parasol, OFF midget, broad
thorny, recursive bistratified, small bistratified, and large bistratified cells.
On average, the number of DB3a contacts to parasol cells (18 contacts per axon
terminal) is higher than that to other ganglion cell types (between four and
seven contacts). We estimate that the DB3a output to OFF parasol cells accounts
for at least 30% of the total DB3a output. Furthermore, we found that OFF parasol
cells receive approximately 20% of their total bipolar input from DB3a cells,
suggesting that other diffuse bipolar types also provide input to OFF parasol
cells. We conclude that DB3a cells preferentially contact OFF parasol cells but
also provide input to other ganglion cell types.

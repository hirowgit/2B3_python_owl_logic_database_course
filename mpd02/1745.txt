In the present article, we have reported the design, synthesis, and
identification of highly potent benzhydrol derivatives as squalene synthase
inhibitors (compound 1). Unfortunately, the in vivo efficacies of the compounds
were not enough for acquiring the clinical candidate. We continued our
investigation to obtain a more in vivo efficacious template than the benzhydrol
template. In our effort, we focused on a benzoxazepine ring and designed a new
tricyclic scaffold by the incorporation of heterocycle into it. Prepared
pyrrolobenzoxazepine derivatives showed further efficient in vitro and in vivo
activities.

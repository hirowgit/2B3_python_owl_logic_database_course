The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is used as a non-human primate
laboratory animal. Marmoset wasting syndrome (MWS) is a disease endemic to
captive colonies, and the pathogenesis is unclear. In the present study,
marmosets with chronic bloody high-viscosity diarrhea, which is a contributing
factor to MWS, were evaluated, and inflammation in the colon was found.
Calprotectin is a surrogate marker of intestinal inflammation and induces
apoptosis. Marmosets with chronic diarrhea exhibited higher levels of fecal
calprotectin. Histochemical analyses showed high expression of calprotectin in
the extravascular neutrophils and apoptosis in the chronic colitis lesions. No
internal microbiological diseases were identified. Although the cause of chronic 
colitis was not identified, the marmoset could be a useful model of inflammatory 
bowel disease.

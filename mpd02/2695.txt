The dorsomedial visual area (DM), a subdivision of extrastriate cortex located
near the dorsal midline, is characterized by heavy myelination and a relative
emphasis on peripheral vision. To date, DM remains the least understood of the
three primary targets of projections from the striate cortex (V1) in New World
monkeys. Here, we characterize the responses of DM neurons in anaesthetized
marmosets to drifting sine wave gratings. Most (82.4%) cells showed bidirectional
sensitivity, with only 6.9% being strongly direction selective. The distribution 
of orientation sensitivity was bimodal, with a distinct population (corresponding
to over half of the sample) formed by neurons with very narrow selectivity. When 
compared with a sample of V1 units representing a comparable range of
eccentricities, DM cells revealed a preference for much lower spatial
frequencies, and higher speeds. End inhibition was extremely rare, and the
responses of many cells summated over distances as large as 30 degrees. Our
results suggest clear differences between DM and the two other main targets of V1
projections, the second (V2) and middle temporal (MT) areas, with cells in DM
emphasizing aspects of visual information that are likely to be relevant for
motor control.

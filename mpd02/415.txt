Preclinical applications of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging
(rsfMRI) offer the possibility to non-invasively probe whole-brain network
dynamics and to investigate the determinants of altered network signatures
observed in human studies. Mouse rsfMRI has been increasingly adopted by numerous
laboratories worldwide. Here we describe a multi-centre comparison of 17 mouse
rsfMRI datasets via a common image processing and analysis pipeline. Despite
prominent cross-laboratory differences in equipment and imaging procedures, we
report the reproducible identification of several large-scale resting-state
networks (RSN), including a mouse default-mode network, in the majority of
datasets. A combination of factors was associated with enhanced reproducibility
in functional connectivity parameter estimation, including animal handling
procedures and equipment performance. RSN spatial specificity was enhanced in
datasets acquired at higher field strength, with cryoprobes, in ventilated
animals, and under medetomidine-isoflurane combination sedation. Our work
describes a set of representative RSNs in the mouse brain and highlights key
experimental parameters that can critically guide the design and analysis of
future rodent rsfMRI investigations.

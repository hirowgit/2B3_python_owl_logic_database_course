Vasectomy results in the occlusion of testicular outflow, leading to autoimmunity
characterized by the production of antisperm antibodies (ASA). Reports on the
rise in ASA following vasectomy in several species are available; however, not
much is known about the specific sperm autoantigens to which postvasectomy
antibodies are directed. In the present study, monoclonal antibodies were
generated using a vasectomized mouse. One of the monoclonal antibodies, D5E5,
identified an approximately 70-kd antigen localized on the principal piece of the
tail and also on the tip of the acrosome of mouse sperm. The cognate antigen was 
expressed postmeiotically in a stage-specific manner during spermiogenesis,
starting from step 8 of elongating spermatids during spermiogenesis up to mature 
spermatozoa. The protein was conserved across the species, as observed by its
presence in rat, bull, marmoset, and human sperm. Following capacitation, the
antigen on the head was seen to shift to the acrosomal region and was lost after 
the acrosome reaction. However, the localization on tip of the acrosome still
persisted, which indicates that the antigen may play a role post-acrosome
reaction in sperm egg interaction. Resistance to Triton X-100 solubilization
indicates that TSA70 could be an acrosomal matrix protein. In addition, we
observed a significant reduction in forward progressive motility of mouse sperm
treated in vitro with D5E5. In view of its testis specificity, acrosome and tail 
localization, and conserved nature, TSA70 is likely to play an important role in 
sperm function.

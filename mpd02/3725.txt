Estimates of the chronological age for animals of unknown age provide useful
information for medical, demographic, and evolutionary studies. Skeletal
development, as indicated by epiphyseal closure, can be used to estimate an
animal's chronological age or specify its stage of development. Many studies of
Primate skeletal development have used animals of unknown age, with the order of 
epiphyseal closure providing a relative age for each animal. This study examines 
the age of epiphyseal closure at 22 epiphyseal sites using animals of known age
at death in three calitrichid species (Saguinus fuscicollis, Saguinus oedipus,
and Callithrix jacchus). The observed average age of epiphyseal closure is
similar in these tamarins and marmosets. There is a significant difference in
rate of development between the species. Regression equations can predict the age
of unknown animals to within 4.8 months for S. fuscicollis, 8.6 months for S.
oedipus, and 7.6 months for C. jacchus (twice the standard error of the
estimate). These age estimates allow us to determine if an animal is relatively
mature or immature, but are largely unacceptable for studies in which precise age
estimates are necessary. The order of epiphyseal closure is similar across 11
monkey species (using additional data from published literature) and supports the
suggestion of a general pattern in Primate skeletal development.

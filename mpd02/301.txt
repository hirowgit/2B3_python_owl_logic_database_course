Marmoset wasting syndrome (MWS) is clinically characterized by progressive weight
loss. Although morbidity and mortality of MWS are relatively high in captive
marmosets, its causes remain unknown. Lipid mediators are bioactive metabolites
which are produced from polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as arachidonic acid
(AA) and eicosapentaenoic acid. These lipid metabolites regulate a wide range of 
inflammatory responses and they are excreted into the urine. As urinary lipid
profiles reflect systemic inflammatory conditions, we comprehensively measured
the levels of 141 types of lipid metabolites in the urines obtained from healthy 
common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) (N = 7) or marmosets with MWS (N = 7). We
found that 41 types of metabolites were detected in all urine samples of both
groups. Among them, AA-derived metabolites accounted for 63% (26/41 types) of all
detected metabolites. Notably, the levels of AA-derived prostaglandin (PG) E2,
PGF2Î±, thromboxane (TX) B2 and F2-isoprostanes significantly increased in the
urine samples of marmosets with MWS. In this study, we found some urinary lipid
metabolites which may be involved in the development of MWS. Although the cause
of MWS remains unclear, our findings may provide some insight into understanding 
the mechanisms of development of MWS.

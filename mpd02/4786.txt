An assessment of the fertilizing ability of spermatozoa in the epididymis of the 
marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus).

Moore HD.

The fertilizing ability of spermatozoa from differ regions of the epididymis of
the marmoset monkey, Callithrix jacchus, was assessed by determining their rate
of fusion with zonaless hamster ova in vitro. This technique tests for functional
competence and was validated using epididymal spermatozoa of the hamster whose
fertility have been measured previously by in vivo fertilization experiments. The
results suggest that some marmoset spermatozoa first acquire the ability to
fertilize in the distal caput and proximal corpus epididymidis although the
majority become fertile on reaching the proximal cauda region. Acquisition of
fertilizing capacity was associated with a change in the degree and character of 
sperm motility. However, it is considered that modifications to the sperm
plasmalemma which allow capacitation and the acrosome reaction to occur are of
primary importance for sperm fertility. The development of sperm fertilizing
ability in the marmoset is discussed in relation to that in other primates.

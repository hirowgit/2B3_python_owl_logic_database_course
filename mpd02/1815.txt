The daily distribution of autogrooming was evaluated in adult marmosets submitted
to different illumination intensities in the light phase of the light-dark cycle.
Autogrooming and locomotor activity were monitored and the faecal cortisol level 
assessed as a stress indicator. The distribution of autogrooming showed two
distinct tendencies: when the light intensity varied from 500 to 200 lux, a
slight increase in frequency and duration was observed, while a significant
decrease in both variables occurred at 10 lux. Varying light intensities did not 
inhibit rhythm synchronization. The daily profile of autogrooming was mainly
unimodal with an acrophase in the first half of the light phase. Faecal cortisol 
levels tended to increase in animals submitted to 100 and 10 lux, but these
results are not conclusive. We suggest keeping captive marmosets in light
intensities of at least 200 lux in the light phase, allowing animals to maintain 
autogrooming levels in order to reduce the discomfort caused by captivity and
isolation.

BACKGROUND: Due to a sporadic occurrence of Mycobacterium avium subsp.
paratuberculosis (MAP) in non-human primates (NHP), the susceptibility of
different NHP to MAP should be investigated.
METHODS: Fecal and tissue samples (ileum, ileocecal lymph node, bone marrow) of
20 animals (seven species) were analyzed by IS900-based PCRs and sequenced.
Samples of MAP PCR positive NHP were further cultivated.
RESULTS: MAP DNA was detectable in two animals; the ileum of a cottontop tamarin 
and the bone marrow of a common marmoset. Cultivation of MAP failed. Sequence
analysis revealed 100% homology to the MAP-K10 sequence. Pathohistological
examinations offered no direct correlation to a MAP infection.
CONCLUSIONS: MAP was detected for the first time in a common marmoset. But as
both NHP suffered from other diseases, an asymptomatic infection with MAP was
assumed. The detection of MAP in the bone marrow might play a role in
establishing latent paratuberculosis, as known from tuberculosis.

Conventional techniques for the noninvasive measurement of brain activity involve
critical limitations in spatial or temporal resolution. Here, we propose the
method for noninvasive brain function measurement with high spatiotemporal
resolution using optical signals. We verified that diffused near-infrared light
penetrating through the upper jaw and into the skull, which we term as
optoencephalography (OEG), leads to the detection of dynamic brain signals that
vary concurrently with the electrophysiological neural activity. We measured the 
OEG signals following the stimulation of the median nerve in common marmosets.
The OEG signal response was tightly coupled with the electrophysiological
response represented by the somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP). The OEG
measurement is also shown to offer rather clear discrimination of brain signals.

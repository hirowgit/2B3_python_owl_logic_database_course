BACKGROUND/AIMS: Chronic infection with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) is strongly
associated with the development of hepatocellular carcinoma but the mechanism by 
which this occurs is unknown. Numerous studies have focused on the HBV X protein 
showing that it activates signal transduction pathways while few have
investigated these changes in HBV-replicating hepatocytes.
METHODS: We utilized the recombinant adenovirus system to deliver a replication
competent HBV genome into Huh7 and primary marmoset hepatocytes (PMH) to examine 
the effects of active viral replication on the regulation of Ras-ERK signal
transduction and related pathways.
RESULTS: Huh7 cells and PMHs replicating HBV demonstrated significant
upregulation in phosphorylated ERK, Akt, c-myc together with increased p53,
cyclin B1 and p21(cip1) expression and cell cycle progression to G2 phase in the 
absence of increased cell proliferation. Phosphorylation of the key cell survival
kinase, Akt, was significantly increased, resulting in increased serine
phosphorylation of the downstream target, GSK3-beta.
CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrated simultaneous activation of the MAP Kinase
and Akt pathways in HBV-replicating hepatocytes that resulted in dysregulation in
the control of cell cycle progression and which help explain the early pathogenic
mechanisms that underlie malignant transformation associated with chronic
hepatitis B infection.

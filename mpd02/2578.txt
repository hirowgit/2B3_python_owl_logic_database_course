Human specific AluY elements were investigated by comparative analysis between
human chromosome 21 and chimpanzee chromosome 22. Human specific AluY element was
identified on human chromosome 21q22 (accession no. AL163282), and then that was 
a new member of AluYj subfamily. From the bioinformatic analysis, AluYj subfamily
was investigated in human whole genome using AluYj4 consensus sequence (accession
no. AL163282). Thirteen members of the AluYj4 elements (4 diagnostic mutations)
and eight members of the AluYj3 elements (3 diagnostic mutations) were identified
with distinct diagnostic mutation from AluY consensus sequence. The results of
the molecular clock calculation of non-CpG region substitution indicated that,
AluYj4 elements (2.1 million years old) may be proliferated more recent time than
AluYj3 elements (14.1 million years old). For the verification of recent
insertion time, four of AluYj4 elements (ch2-AC017101, ch10-AC044786,
ch12-AC007656 and ch21-AL163282) from human chromosomes 2, 10, 12, 21 were
analyzed by PCR amplification using various human and primate DNA samples.
Though, no polymorphism was detected in human population, we identified the new
AluYj4 subfamily as the human specific elements.

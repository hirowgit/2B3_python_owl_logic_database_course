Experimental infection of marmoset monkeys (Callithrix jacchus) with Leptospira
interrogans serovar Copenhageni showed microscopic patterns of tissue reactions
comparable to those seen in the severe forms of human leptospirosis, including
intra-alveolar hemorrhage. The most impressive microscopic changes were seen in
the lung and kidney of animals killed at days 6 and 12 after inoculation. There
were extensive and irregular areas of hemorrhage predominating around main
bronchial branches or diffusely spread to the pulmonary parenchyma, as well as
severe tubulointerstitial nephritis. Antibody response detected by the
microscopic agglutination test was quantitatively similar to those seen in humans
and paralleled severity of tissue lesions. The distribution of leptospires or
antigenic debris in infected tissues was observed by immunofluorescence and
confocal laser scanning microscopy. Large numbers of typical leptospires were
seen in the lumen of proximal renal tubules. Positive reactions showing antigenic
debris were closely associated with sites of tissue damage.

Junin virus infection of Calithrix jacchus: haematological findings.

Frigerio MJ, Rondinone SN, Callelo MA, Paradisi ER, Weissenbacher MC.

Haematological changes produced by experimental Junin virus infection of a
platyrrhine monkey, Callithrix jacchus were studied. Normocytic and normochromic 
anaemia appeared after 7 days post infection (p. i.), and increased steadily
until day 21 p. i. Reticulocytes and circulating erythroblasts were elevated
during the anaemia, reached a peak on day 7 p. i., and disappeared later.
Platelets and leukocytes showed a significant decrease from days 14 and 18 p. i.,
respectively. These alterations could be attributed to the damage of bone marrow 
and lymphatic tissue.

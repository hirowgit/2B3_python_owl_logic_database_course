UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) are essential drug-conjugation enzymes that
metabolize a variety of endobiotic and xenobiotic substrates. The molecular
characteristics of UGTs have been extensively investigated in humans, but remain 
to be investigated in common marmosets, a nonhuman primate species widely used in
drug metabolism studies. In this study, 11 UGT cDNAs (UGT1A1, 1A3, 1A4, 1A6, 1A7,
and 1A9; and UGT2B49, 2B50, 2B51, 2B52, and 2B53) were isolated and characterized
in marmosets. Marmoset UGT1As had high sequence identities (89-93%) with human
UGT1As, but the sequence identities of marmoset UGT2Bs were lower (82-86%).
Marmoset UGTs were found to be phylogenetically close to human UGTs. Just as
human UGT1As do, marmoset UGT1A genes shared exons 2-5 and contained a variable
exon 1 unique to each gene; in contrast, marmoset UGT2B genes contained six
unique exons. Moreover, marmoset and human UGT1A and UGT2B gene clusters were
located in corresponding regions in their respective genomes. Among the five
tissue types tested, marmoset UGT mRNAs were most abundantly expressed in liver, 
jejunum, and/or kidney, i.e., in tissues important for drug metabolism, just as
human UGTs are. Among the 11 marmoset UGT mRNAs investigated, marmoset UGT1A9,
1A4, and 1A6 mRNAs were the most abundantly expressed in liver, small intestine, 
and kidney, respectively. Marmoset liver microsomes and recombinant UGT1A
proteins catalyzed the glucuronidation of the same substrates that human UGT1As
catalyze, including estradiol, trifluoperazine, 4-methylumbelliferone, serotonin,
4-nitrophenol, and propofol. Trifluoperazine was glucuronidated by marmoset liver
microsomes, but not by any of the UGT1A isoforms examined under the present
conditions. These results collectively suggest that functional marmoset UGTs have
generally similar molecular characteristics to human UGTs.

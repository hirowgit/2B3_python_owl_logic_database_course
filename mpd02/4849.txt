Sex determination in the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).

Stein FJ.

The general morphology of the external genitalia was examined in 43 common
marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) ranging in age from newborn to adult. At birth,
the scrotum was a small irregular fold of skin on either side of the caudal
aspect of the penis. The testes were not present in the scrotum until 8--11
months of age. The scrotum covered the penis in the adult male, was devoid of
fur, was covered by pearly while nodules, and presented a median raphe. In the
young female, the pudendal pad closely resembled the scrotum of the male. The
vulva was pendulous, and the small vestibular opening was located near its most
ventral aspect and closely resembled the preputial opening of the male. In the
adult female, the pudendal pad was pendulous, was studded with white nodules, and
closely resembled the scrotum of the male. Sex determination by casual
observation resulted in numerous errors. Accurate sex determination was based on 
differences in the preputial and vestibular openings, demonstration of the glans 
penis in the prepuce, and palpation of the testes in the scrotum or inguinal
region.

An outbreak of classical herpetic infection causing vesicoulcerative stomatitis
in a family group (eight animals) of Callithrix jacchus is described. In all
eight infected animals, human herpesvirus 1 (HHV-1) was identified as the
causative agent. This was confirmed by histologic, immunohistologic, and
molecular biologic investigations, as well as by virus isolation. The clinical
picture, the macroscopic appearance, and the histologic results indicated a
herpes infection as the cause of mortality. Alterations of the oral mucous
membranes were erosive to ulcerative with typical intranuclear inclusions.
Immunohistologic and molecular biologic techniques clearly identified the HHV-1
virus and excluded other possible primate herpesviruses such as B-virus, SA8,
HVP-2, and Herpes tamarinus. The significance of this herpesvirus infection for
colony management is discussed.

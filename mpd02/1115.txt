We developed a model of hepatitis E virus infection in common marmosets
(Callithrix jacchus) and determined optimal route of infection, duration,
clinical and virological characteristics of infection in laboratory animals.
Using this model, we demonstrated that replication of hepatitis E virus primarily
occurs in the liver, while virus replication presumed to take place in the
intestine was not confirmed in this experiment.

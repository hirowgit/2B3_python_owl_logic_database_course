The structure of the brain as a product of morphogenesis is difficult to
reconcile with the observed complexity of cerebral connectivity. We therefore
analyzed relationships of adjacency and crossing between cerebral fiber pathways 
in four nonhuman primate species and in humans by using diffusion magnetic
resonance imaging. The cerebral fiber pathways formed a rectilinear
three-dimensional grid continuous with the three principal axes of development.
Cortico-cortical pathways formed parallel sheets of interwoven paths in the
longitudinal and medio-lateral axes, in which major pathways were local
condensations. Cross-species homology was strong and showed emergence of complex 
gyral connectivity by continuous elaboration of this grid structure. This
architecture naturally supports functional spatio-temporal coherence,
developmental path-finding, and incremental rewiring with correlated adaptation
of structure and function in cerebral plasticity and evolution.

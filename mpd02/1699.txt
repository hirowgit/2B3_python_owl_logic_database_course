Two captive cottontop tamarins (Sanguinus oedipus) died within 5 d of each other 
from systemic infection by Francisella tularensis (tularemia). One tamarin
experienced mild clinical signs, including malaise, anorexia, and a mucoid nasal 
discharge for 4 d before death, whereas the other experienced a more rapid
progression of disease that lasted less than 24 h. Differential diagnoses
included gram-negative septicemia by an organism such as Escherichia coli,
Salmonella, or Yersinia; protozoal infection such as Toxoplasma gondii or an
acute viral infection such as lymphocytic choriomeningitis. F. tularensis
infection was identified by F. tularensis-specific PCR in both primates. Possible
sources of infection include aerosol, biting arthropod vectors, and transmission 
via a rodent reservoir. This case report highlights the importance of tularemia
as a differential diagnosis in acute febrile illness in captive nonhuman
primates.

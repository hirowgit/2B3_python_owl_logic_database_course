Movement dysfunction in Parkinson's disease (PD) is caused by the degeneration of
dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra (SN). Here, we established a
method for voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and automatic tissue segmentation of the
marmoset monkey brain using a 7-T animal scanner and applied the method to assess
DA degeneration in a PD model, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine
(MPTP)-treated animals, with tyrosine-hydroxylase staining. The most significant 
decreases of local tissue volume were detected in the bilateral SN of
MPTP-treated marmoset brains (-53.0% in right and -46.5% in left) and
corresponded with the location of DA neurodegeneration found in histology (-65.4%
in right). In addition to the SN, the decreases were also confirmed in the locus 
coeruleus, and lateral hypothalamus. VBM using 7-T MRI was effective in detecting
volume loss in the SN of the PD-model marmoset. This study provides a potential
basis for the application of VBM with ultra-high field MRI in the clinical
diagnosis of PD. The developed method may also offer value in automatic
whole-brain evaluation of structural changes for the marmoset monkey.

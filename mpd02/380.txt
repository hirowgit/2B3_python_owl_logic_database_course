BACKGROUND: For the diagnosis and treatment of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma
(ATLL) caused by human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) are required
therapeutic modalities urgently. Non-human primate models for ATLL would provide 
a valuable information for clinical studies. We did a pilot study to establish an
ATLL non-human primate model using common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus).
METHODS: We inoculated HTLV-1-producing MT-2 cells into 9-month-old marmosets,
either intraperitoneally or intravenously. We next administrated MT-2 cells into 
13-month-old marmosets under cyclosporine A (CsA) treatment to promote infection.
HTLV-1 infection was determined by measuring HTLV-1 antibody titer in the common 
marmosets.
RESULTS: The HTLV-1 antibody titer increased in the intraperitoneally inoculated 
marmoset with or without CsA treatment, and it kept over five 5 years though
proviral copy number (proviral load, PVL) remained low throughout the study.
CONCLUSION: We obtained HTLV-1 asymptomatic carriers of common marmosets by
inoculating MT-2 cells.

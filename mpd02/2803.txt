The aim of the study was to describe and quantify the changes in the maternal
vasculature and angiogenesis during early pregnancy in the marmoset endometrium
using bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) to identify proliferating cells, CD31 to label
endothelial cells and dual staining to identify proliferating endothelial cells. 
Non-pregnant animals from mid- and late secretory stages were studied and
compared with pregnant animals at weeks 2, 3 and 4 of pregnancy. Qualitative and 
morphometric analyses of angiogenesis and vascular area were performed. The
results show that pregnancy is associated with increasing angiogenesis in the
upper zone of the endometrium, becoming significantly increased at 3 weeks. This 
is associated with an increase in the vessel area and diameter in this zone.
These results provide the platform from which to design studies in which specific
angiogenic factors can be targeted in vivo during early pregnancy in order to
determine their role in regulating these vascular changes.

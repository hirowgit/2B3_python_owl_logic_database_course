The objective of this study is to investigate factors influencing infant survival
in captive common marmosets. We investigated the influence of age-specific
weight, litter size, caging, and the presence of helpers on survival to 6 months 
of age in 189 Callithrix jacchus infants. Infant survival was analyzed using Cox 
Proportional Hazards regression, and fitness functions were plotted to explore
the relationship between survival and growth. Results indicate that weights at
birth and 120 days significantly affect future survival probability. Litter size 
significantly influences survival prior to 60 days of age with larger litters
having poorer survival. Males and females did not have significantly different
survival and the presence of helpers in the group did not influence survival
probability. Patterns of survival with respect to age-specific weights suggest
stabilizing selection on birth weight and directional selection on weight at 120 
days of age.

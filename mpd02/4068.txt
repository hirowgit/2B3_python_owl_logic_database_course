Degeneration of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons is the primary
histopathological feature of Parkinson's disease. The neurotoxin MPTP
(1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) induces a neurological syndrome in
man and non-human primates very similar to idiopathic Parkinson's disease by
selectively destroying dopaminergic nigrostriatal neurons. This gives rise to the
hypothesis that Parkinson's disease may be caused by endogenous or environmental 
toxins. Endogenous excitatory amino acids (EAAs) such as L-glutamate could be
involved in neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson's disease. We report 
in this study that the competitive NMDA antagonist CPP
(3-((+/-)-2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)-propyl-1-phosphonic acid) protects nigral
tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) positive neurons from degeneration induced by systemic 
treatment with MPTP in common marmosets. This indicates that EAAs are involved in
the pathophysiological cascade of MPTP-induced neuronal cell death and that EAA
antagonists may offer a neuroprotective therapy for Parkinson's disease.

Subcellular resolution imaging of the whole brain and subsequent image analysis
are prerequisites for understanding anatomical and functional brain networks.
Here, we have developed a very high-speed serial-sectioning imaging system named 
FAST (block-face serial microscopy tomography), which acquires high-resolution
images of a whole mouse brain in a speed range comparable to that of light-sheet 
fluorescence microscopy. FAST enables complete visualization of the brain at a
resolution sufficient to resolve all cells and their subcellular structures. FAST
renders unbiased quantitative group comparisons of normal and disease model brain
cells for the whole brain at a high spatial resolution. Furthermore, FAST is
highly scalable to non-human primate brains and human postmortem brain tissues,
and can visualize neuronal projections in a whole adult marmoset brain. Thus,
FAST provides new opportunities for global approaches that will allow for a
better understanding of brain systems in multiple animal models and in human
diseases.

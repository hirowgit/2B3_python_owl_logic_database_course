Adeno-associated virus 6 (AAV6) has been proposed as a potential vector candidate
for specific gene expression in pain-related dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, 
but this has not been confirmed in nonhuman primates. The aim of our study was to
analyze the transduction efficiency and target specificity of this viral vector
in the common marmoset by comparing it with those in the rat. When green
fluorescent protein-expressing serotype-6 vector was injected into the sciatic
nerve, the efficiency of gene expression in DRG neurons was comparable in both
species. We found that the serotype-6 vector was largely specific to the
pain-related ganglion neurons in the marmoset, as well as in the rat, whereas the
serotype-9 vector resulted in contrasting effects in the two species. Neither
AAV6 nor AAV9 resulted in DRG toxicity when administered via the sciatic nerve,
suggesting this as a safer route of sensory nerve transduction than the currently
used intrathecal or intravenous administrative routes. Furthermore, the AAV6
vector could be an optimal serotype for gene therapy for human chronic pain that 
has a minimal effect on other somatosensory functions of DRG neurons.

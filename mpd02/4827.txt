Fetal hemoglobin: in vivo stimulation by D-thyroxine in adult marmosets.

Fuhr JE, Gengozian N.

Reactivation of fetal hemoglobin gene expressions was studied in new-world
monkeys (marmosets). After a series of intraperitoneal injections of D-thyroxine,
fetal hemoglobin production was increased in three experimental animals. Control 
animals were unaffected by the injection of the solvent. Because the percentage
of cells containing fetal hemoglobin exceeded the total percentage of fetal
hemoglobin, it was concluded that thyroid hormone influenced the synthesis of
fetal hemoglobin rather than the development of a population of fetal cells.

Deafness is one of the most common types of congenital impairments, and at least 
half of the cases are caused by hereditary mutations. Mutations of the gene
KIAA1199 are associated with progressive hearing loss. Its expression is abundant
in human cochlea, but interestingly the spatial expression patterns are different
between mouse and rat cochleae; the pattern in humans has not been fully
investigated. We performed immunohistochemical analysis of a nonhuman primate,
common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), cochlea with a KIAA1199-specific antibody. 
In the common marmoset cochlea, KIAA1199 protein expression was more widespread
than in rodents, with all epithelial cells, including hair cells, expressing
KIAA1199. Our results suggest that the primate pattern of KIAA1199 expression is 
wider in comparison with rodents and may play an essential role in the
maintenance of cochlear epithelial cells.

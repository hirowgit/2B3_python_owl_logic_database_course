Complementary DNA of marmoset CYP1A2 was isolated by means of screening the cDNA 
library and reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. The deduced amino
acid sequence of marmoset CYP1A2 consisted of 516 residues and showed 88.2 and
90.0% identities to corresponding forms in human and cynomolgus monkey,
respectively. S1 nuclease protection assay demonstrated that CYP1A2 mRNA was
expressed constitutively in the liver, but not in the lung, kidney and small
intestine. The level of CYP1A2 mRNA in the liver was increased by treatment with 
3-methylcholanthrene and polychlorinated biphenyls. Marmoset CYP1A2 expressed in 
recombinant yeast activated 2-amino-3-methylimidazo [4,5-f]quinoline (IQ) and
2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo [4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx) efficiently, and also
activated 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo [4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP), but at a
relatively lower rate in the umu mutagenicity test. Marmoset CYP1A2 also showed
ethoxyresorufin O-de-ethylase activity. Based on these results, we demonstrate
that marmosets constitutively express CYP1A2 in the liver as in humans.

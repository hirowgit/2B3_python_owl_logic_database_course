Common marmosets vocalize phee calls as isolation calls, which seem to facilitate
their reunion with family groups. To identify multiple acoustic properties with
different time courses, we examined acoustic modulations of phees during
different social contexts of isolation. Subject marmosets were totally isolated
in one condition, were visually isolated and could exchange vocalizations in
another condition, and were visually isolated and subsequently totally isolated
in a third condition. We recorded 6,035 phees of 10 male-female marmoset pairs
and conducted acoustic analysis. The marmosets frequently vocalized phees that
were temporally elongated and louder during isolation, with varying time courses 
of these changes in acoustic parameters. The vocal rates and sound levels of the 
phees increased as soon as the marmosets saw their pair mates being taken away,
and then gradually calmed down. The phee duration was longer in conditions during
which there were no vocal responses from their pair mates. Louder vocalizations
are conspicuous and seem to be effective for long-distance transmission, whereas 
shorter call duration during vocal exchanges might avoid possible vocal overlap
between mates.

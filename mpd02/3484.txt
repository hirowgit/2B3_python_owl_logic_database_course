Definition of the immune process that causes demyelination in multiple sclerosis 
is essential to determine the feasibility of Ag-directed immunotherapy. Using the
nonhuman primate, Callithrix jacchus jacchus (common marmoset), we show that
immunization with myelin basic protein and proteolipid protein determinants
results in clinical disease with significant demyelination. Demyelination was
associated with spreading to myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)
determinants that generated anti-MOG serum Abs and Ig deposition in central
nervous system white matter lesions. These data associate intermolecular
"determinant spreading" with clinical autoimmune disease in primates and raise
important issues for the pathogenesis and treatment of multiple sclerosis.

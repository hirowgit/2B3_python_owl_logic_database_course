Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) spectroscopy in combination with
pattern recognition techniques were used to investigate the composition of
organic compounds in urines from patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), patients 
with other neurological diseases (OND) and healthy controls (H). Using a valid
animal model of MS, namely the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) model of
experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the relation of disease
progression and alteration of the urine composition was investigated. Urine
samples were collected during different stages of EAE, either induced with whole 
human myelin or with the myelin protein MOG in complete adjuvant. The urine
samples were analysed with 1H-NMR spectroscopy allowing simultaneous detection of
an array of compounds. Spectral differences between urines from EAE-affected and 
healthy monkeys were assessed with multivariate analysis. Evidence is provided
that development of EAE is associated with changes in the chemical composition of
the urine, in particular of compounds with NMR peaks in the region of the
spectrum between 0.5 and 3.50 ppm. In addition, we found preliminary evidence for
differences between urines from MS, OND and H groups.

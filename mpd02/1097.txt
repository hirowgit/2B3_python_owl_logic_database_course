Spatial tuning properties of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) are sharpened by
lateral inhibition originating at both the outer and inner plexiform layers.
Lateral inhibition in the retina contributes to local contrast enhancement and
sharpens edges. In this study, we used dynamic clamp recordings to examine the
contribution of inner plexiform inhibition, originating from spiking amacrine
cells, to the spatial tuning of RGCs. This was achieved by injecting currents
generated from physiologically recorded excitatory and inhibitory stimulus-evoked
conductances, into different types of primate and mouse RGCs. We determined the
effects of injections of size-dependent conductances in which presynaptic
inhibition and/or direct inhibition onto RGCs were partly removed by blocking the
activity of spiking amacrine cells. We found that inhibition originating from
spiking amacrine cells onto bipolar cell terminals and onto RGCs, work together
to sharpen the spatial tuning of RGCs. Furthermore, direct inhibition is crucial 
for preventing spike generation at stimulus offset. These results reveal how
inhibitory mechanisms in the inner plexiform layer contribute to determining size
tuning and provide specificity to stimulus polarity.

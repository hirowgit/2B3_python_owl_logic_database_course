The mechanisms of measles virus (MV) vaccine attenuation are insufficiently
characterized. Because the Edmonston vaccine strain can enter cells through CD46 
in addition to the primary MV receptor signaling lymphocyte activation molecule
(SLAM or CD150), we asked whether and how its tropism is altered. In human
tonsillar tissue, this vaccine strain infects naive (CD45RA(+)CD62L(+)) T
lymphocytes, which express SLAM very infrequently, with much higher efficiency
than do wild-type strains. By contrast, it infects B lymphocytes, macrophages,
and NK cells with significantly lower efficiencies than those of wild-type
strains. Infection levels by wild-type strains correlate with the frequency of
SLAM expression and are highest in B cells, which are 40%-55% infected.
SLAM-expressing T cells are more readily infected by all MV strains than are
SLAM-expressing B cells. Thus, vaccine attenuation may be caused by tropism
alteration in combination with suboptimal replication.

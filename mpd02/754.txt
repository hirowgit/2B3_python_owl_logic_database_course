SURGICAL METHODS.

Population control techniques, either permanent or reversible, are important
tools for the management of wildlife in captive and natural environments. Among
these, surgical sterilization provides a permanent solution to unwanted
reproduction. Surgical techniques can differ in their invasiveness and in the
subsequent effect on behavior and physiology. For social animals, techniques that
preserve gonads, such as vasectomy for males and ligation of uterine tubes for
females, may be preferred because they maintain important physiology that
influences behavior. This study compared two sterilization procedures for captive
hybrid marmosets ( Callithrix sp.). Twenty adult females undergoing tubal
ligation were divided into two groups and received treatment either with a
laparotomy or a laparoscopic method. The following parameters were evaluated for 
each female: duration of procedure, pain levels, weight gain, wound healing,
adhesion, and inflammation. The results indicate that both techniques were
equally effective. However, the conventional surgery may be more advantageous,
because it is significantly shorter in duration, is only slightly more invasive, 
and requires less formal training of the surgeon.

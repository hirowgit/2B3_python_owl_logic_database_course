Anhedonia is a core symptom of depression, but the underlying neurobiological
mechanisms are unknown. Correlative neuroimaging studies implicate dysfunction
within ventromedial prefrontal cortex, but the causal roles of specific
subregions remain unidentified. We addressed these issues by combining
intracerebral microinfusions with cardiovascular and behavioral monitoring in
marmoset monkeys to show that over-activation of primate subgenual anterior
cingulate cortex (sgACC, area 25) blunts appetitive anticipatory, but not
consummatory, arousal, whereas manipulations of adjacent perigenual ACC (pgACC,
area 32) have no effect. sgACC/25 over-activation also reduces the willingness to
work for reward. 18F-FDG PET imaging reveals over-activation induced metabolic
changes in circuits involved in reward processing and interoception. Ketamine
treatment ameliorates the blunted anticipatory arousal and reverses associated
metabolic changes. These results demonstrate a causal role for primate sgACC/25
over-activity in selective aspects of impaired reward processing translationally 
relevant to anhedonia, and ketamine's modulation of an affective network to exert
its action.

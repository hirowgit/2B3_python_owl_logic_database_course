The AGM-27 strain OF hepatitis A virus (HAV) was originally isolated from an
African green monkey with hepatitis and appears to represent a true simian
strain. The virus caused acute hepatitis after intravenous inoculation into
African green monkeys, rhesus monkeys, and marmosets. Cynomolgus monkeys
inoculated with the virus did not develop hepatitis, probably because of prior
exposure to HAV. Chimpanzees inoculated with a high dose of the virus did not
develop signs of hepatitis, although the virus replicated and the animals
seroconverted. Marmosets and chimpanzees convalescent from infection with the
AGM-27 strain of HAV were rechallenged with the virulent HM-175 strain of human
HAV. They were partially or totally protected from disease.

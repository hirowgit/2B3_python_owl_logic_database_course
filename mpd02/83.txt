A seven-year-old female common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) presented with
weight loss. Imaging revealed a left thoracic mass, confirmed at necropsy.
Histology and immunohistochemistry suggested a well-differentiated pulmonary
adenocarcinoma. No evidence of local lymphovascular invasion or distant
metastasis was observed. This is the first report of pulmonary adenocarcinoma in 
marmosets.

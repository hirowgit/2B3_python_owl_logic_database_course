Accumulating evidence corroborates the role of the "central vein sign" in the
radiological diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS). Here, we report human magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) and corresponding pathological data that
inflammation-dependent intracerebral remodeling of the vessel wall is directly
associated with the prominence of intralesional veins on susceptibility-based
MRI. In adult marmosets with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis,
vessel-wall fibrosis was detected early in the demyelinating process, even in
lesions <2 weeks old, though fibrosis was more evident after 6 weeks. Vascular
remodeling consisted of both luminal enlargement and eccentric thickening of the 
perivascular space (fibrillar collagen type I deposition) and affected almost
exclusively white matter, but not subpial cortical, lesions. The long-term effect
of vessel remodeling in MS lesions is currently unknown, but it might potentially
affect tissue repair. ANN NEUROL 2019;85:934-942.

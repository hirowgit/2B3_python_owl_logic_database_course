Squalestatins without either the hydroxy group at C-4 or the carboxylic acid at
C-3 or C-4 were prepared and evaluated for their ability to inhibit rat liver
microsomal squalene synthase (SQS) in vitro. These modifications were well
tolerated for compounds with the 4,6-dimethyloctenoate ester at C-6 (S1 series). 
However in analogues without the C-6 ester (H1 series), removal of the C-4
hydroxy group gave compounds with reduced potency, whereas decarboxylation at C-3
resulted in a dramatic loss of SQS inhibitory activity. In comparison with S1 1, 
C-4 deoxyS1 3 and C-3 decarboxyS1 10 have shorter in vivo durations of action on 
the inhibition of hepatic cholesterol biosynthesis in rats. C-4 deoxyS1 3 retains
good serum cholesterol-lowering ability in marmosets, while C-3 decarboxyS1 10
showed only a marginal effect even at high dose.

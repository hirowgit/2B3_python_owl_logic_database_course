We studied normal and tumorous three-dimensional (3D) microvascular networks in
primate and rat brain. Tissues were prepared following a new preparation
technique intended for high-resolution synchrotron tomography of microvascular
networks. The resulting 3D images with a spatial resolution of less than the
minimum capillary diameter permit a complete description of the entire vascular
network for volumes as large as tens of cubic millimeters. The structural
properties of the vascular networks were investigated by several multiscale
methods such as fractal and power-spectrum analysis. These investigations gave a 
new coherent picture of normal and pathological complex vascular structures. They
showed that normal cortical vascular networks have scale-invariant fractal
properties on a small scale from 1.4 mum up to 40 to 65 mum. Above this
threshold, vascular networks can be considered as homogeneous. Tumor vascular
networks show similar characteristics, but the validity range of the fractal
regime extend to much larger spatial dimensions. These 3D results shed new light 
on previous two dimensional analyses giving for the first time a direct
measurement of vascular modules associated with vessel-tissue surface exchange.

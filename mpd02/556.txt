The life history of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) points to this
species as a premiere nonhuman primate aging model. In order to take advantage of
these features, we require an expanded and refined understanding of aging in this
species. The papers in this special issue move this field forward substantially
by providing exciting new findings about the aging of the common marmoset and the
potential this species offers for revealing aging's secrets and improving the
lives of aging humans.

Plasmodium brasilianum causes chronic quartan malaria in the common marmoset
Callithrix jacchus, whereas Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is followed by an 
infectious mononucleosis-like syndrome that resolves. We infected weanling
marmosets with one or both of these pathogens. Timing of the infections
influenced outcome. Six animals were simultaneously infected with both agents;
four became seriously ill (with accompanying proteinuria and edema) and either
died or were killed. Histopathology indicated that glomerulonephritis had
developed. The two survivors had more-prolonged parasitemia than did animals
infected with P. brasilianum alone, as did animals infected with EBV before P.
brasilianum. Five of the six simultaneously infected animals had absent or low
titers of antibody to Epstein-Barr viral capsid antigens when compared with the
other EBV-infected animals. Our results suggest that combined infection may be
part of the etiology of quartan malarial nephropathy.

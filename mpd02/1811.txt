A 3-year-old female common marmoset was euthanatized because of wasting. Grossly,
a perforating lesion was present in the jejunum and hemorrhagic lesions in the
cecum and colon. Histopathologically, these gross lesions were a perforated
jejunal ulcer and necrotizing colitis, respectively. Necrotizing colitis was
characterized by extensive mucosal necrosis along with numerous ribbon-shaped
aseptate hyphae. These aseptate hyaline hyphae were positively stained with PAS
and GMS, and reacted immunohistochemically with the antibody against the family
Mucoraceae. This case was diagnosed as intestinal mucormycosis. This is the first
report on mucormycosis in a common marmoset.

The distribution of the collagen types I, III, IV, V, VI and of the glycoprotein 
laminin have been examined in the healthy gingiva of the marmoset with the
indirect immunofluorescence method. It has been shown that collagen type I formed
thick fibrils in a wave-like pattern, while collagen type III formed thinner
fibrils, especially under the epithelial basal membrane. Collagen type IV and
laminin showed a strong fluorescence in the basal membrane (epithelium, vessels, 
nerves). Collagen type V has been demonstrated as a fine fibrillar pattern in the
lamina propria and occasionally close to the basal membrane. Collagen type VI has
been represented as a microfibrillar network in the connective tissue matrix with
a brilliant pericellular fluorescence around vessels and nerves. The study showed
the structural model of the connective tissue matrix of the marmoset gingiva and 
allows a later comparison between inflamed and healthy gingiva.

The metabolism of radiohafnium in marmosets and hamsters.

Taylor DM, Seidel A, Doerfel H.

The whole body retention of 181Hf was studied in marmosets (Callithrex jacchus)
and found to be closely similar to that in rats and Chinese hamsters. Limited
tissue distribution studies suggest a higher uptake in liver and much lower
deposition in skin and muscle in the marmoset as compared to the rat or Chinese
hamster. Studies in Chinese hamsters showed that treatment with the chelating
agent diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid resulted in only a small reduction in
the whole body retention of 181Hf. The absorption of orally administered 181Hf,
in various chemical forms, was found to be between 0.04 and 0.13% of the ingested
dose and was unaffected by age between 5 and 21 months but was increased by
fasting. The measured absorption of 181Hf in Chinese hamsters and in rats was
similar to that of plutonium suggesting that radiohafnium could be used as a
surrogate for plutonium for selected studies in human volunteers.

Gene expression profiling was performed in the laser capture microdissected
substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) after a single administration of
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) in common marmosets. RNA from
substantia nigra pars compacta tissue underwent a double linear amplification and
was then applied to a whole human genome oligo microarray. Since the number of
TH-immunoreactive cells in the SNc decreased to 50% of that in the control after 
14 days and since our previous study showed that down-regulation of mRNA levels
precedes cell death, genes for which mRNA levels were below 50% of levels in the 
vehicle-treated control throughout the experimental period were defined as being 
vulnerable to MPTP in the present study. There were 48 genes that satisfied this 
condition. In order to elucidate mechanisms of dopaminergic cell death in
Parkinson's disease, extensive gene expression studies at various time points
after MPTP and with various MPTP doses are required.

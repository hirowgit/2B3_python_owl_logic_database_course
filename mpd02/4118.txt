Human sera were tested for antibodies against the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) latent
infection terminal proteins (TPs). Anti-TP IgG and IgA antibodies were detected
by an indirect immunofluorescence assay of insect cells expressing a recombinant 
TP1. Out of 301 human sera of patients with EBV-related and EBV-unrelated
disorders, only sera from patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) (32/83;
38%) showed anti-TP antibodies. Studies on serial sera from German and Hong Kong 
NPC patients revealed a decline of anti-TP antibodies during tumour therapy, and 
none of these antibodies were identified in patients with early tumour stages or 
in remission. Comparative studies of TP1-specific polyclonal rabbit antisera and 
human TP-positive sera showed clear differences in the TP epitopes recognized by 
each. Human antisera contained antibodies only to native epitopes in exons 2 to 7
of TP1 whereas rabbit antisera reacted only with epitopes located in the first
exon and, additionally, exhibited EBV strain specificities.

The existence of follicles with a "super flat" epithelium and the large number of
primary and especially secondary lysosomes and lipofuscin granules in these cells
are characteristic features of the thyroid gland of adult marmosets (Callithrix
jacchus, new-world monkeys). It is supposed that these morphological findings are
indications of a relatively low function and early ageing.

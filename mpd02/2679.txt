PURPOSE: To characterize the effects of visual form deprivation by diffuser in
marmoset monkey eyes across a range of ages.
METHODS: Twenty-four common marmosets were grouped by onset of deprivation (group
1: 0-39 days, n = 6; group 2: 40-99 days, n = 10; and group 3: 100-200 days, n = 
8). Monocular form deprivation was induced with a white translucent diffuser worn
for 28 to 88 days (mean durations: group 1, 32 days; group 2, 56 days; and group 
3, 51 days). Refractive state, corneal curvature, and vitreous chamber depth were
measured after cycloplegia. Both experimental and control eyes were measured
multiple times before, during, and after the visual deprivation period.
RESULTS: Marmosets in all age groups tested were susceptible to visual form
deprivation myopia; however, the response to form deprivation was variable and
included a majority with axial myopia (n = 15), several nonresponders (n = 4), a 
single late responder (axial myopia after the end of deprivation period), and
several axial hyperopes (n = 4). For all animals that responded with axial
myopia, the increase in vitreous chamber depth and myopia was inversely
proportional to the age of onset of deprivation (ANOVA, P < 0.05). After the end 
of the period of deprivation, recovery from myopia by reduction of the axial
growth rate was observed in three animals from group 1 and three animals from
group 2.
CONCLUSIONS: Form deprivation by diffusers disrupted emmetropization in marmosets
over a range of ages. The responses varied among individuals and with age,
suggesting that the maturity of the eye may influence the response to visual
signals responsible for form deprivation myopia and perhaps emmetropization.
Recovery from diffuser-induced form deprivation myopia was apparent in some
animals, in contrast to that reported for visual deprivation by lid-suturing, and
appears more prevalent in the younger animals.

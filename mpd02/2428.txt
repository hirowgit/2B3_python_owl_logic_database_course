Two adult Wied's marmosets (Callithrix kuhlii) presented with jaundice, anemia,
and weight loss. Death of one individual was attributed to renal tubular
necrosis; liver and kidney were positive for Leptospira antigen by
immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. The second animal was negative for antigen by
IHC staining, but serologically positive for Leptospira borgpetersenii serovar
ballum with an eightfold titer increase in paired samples, and was euthanized
because of unresponsiveness to treatment. Environmental contamination by mice was
suspected as the Leptospira source.

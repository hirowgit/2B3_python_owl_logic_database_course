A technique for nonsurgical embryo transfer in common marmosets was developed.
Transfers were either synchronous (ST) or asynchronous (AT). Synchronous
transfers (embryo donor and the embryo recipient ovulated on the same day) were
performed 5 to 8 days post-ovulation. Asynchronous transfers (embryo donor had
ovulated at least 2 days before the embryo recipient) were performed when the
recipient was 2 to 4 days post-ovulation (donor was 6 to 8 days post-ovulation). 
Four pregnancies from nine transfers (44%) were established by AT, and three
pregnancies were carried to term. Only 1 of 11 transfers (9%) from ST resulted in
a pregnancy, which was lost by Day 40 of gestation. Significantly more infants
were born from AT (6 infants from 17 embryos; 35%) than from ST (0 infants from
22 embryos; 0%; p < 0.005). This technique allows experimental analysis of
primate postimplantation development and provides a tool for conservation of
endangered Callithrichid species.

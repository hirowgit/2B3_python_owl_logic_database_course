H2O2-generating monoamine oxidase can be visualized in the light microscope with 
tetrazolium, metal salt (ferricyanide) and coupled peroxidatic oxidation methods.
Due to methodological draw-backs these procedures do no allow satisfactory
results. In search for an alternative method a light microscopic cerium procedure
was designed in which the primary reaction product, cerium perhydroxide, serves
for the generation of amplified and intensified diaminobenzidine brown. With this
cerium-diaminobenzidine-H2O2-Co method monoamine oxidase was visualized more
easily and reliably and with higher sensitivity and more precise localization
than with the other techniques. At present this method is considered to be the
procedure of choice and was used to re-investigate and investigate the
distribution of monoamine oxidase in rats, mice, gerbils, guinea-pigs, marmosets,
monkeys and man. In these species many cells and tissues showed monoamine oxidase
activity where the enzyme has not yet been found before and the structures with
already known monoamine oxidase activity showed an improved localization.

BACKGROUND: Non-human primates (NHPs) are susceptible to dogs' attacks, events
that may cause muscle damage along with stress, and could be in some extent
compatible with capture myopathy, a syndrome that results in myoglobinuria and
renal damage.
METHODS: We aimed to evaluate by histopathology pre-existing lesions and
subsequent sequelae related to dogs' attacks, acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and
myoglobinuria, as well as the usefulness of Pearls Stain and IHC to diagnose it. 
Histopathology was performed in available organs, and sections of kidney
submitted to Prussian blue stain and myoglobin immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: During January 2014-June 2016, 16/145 (11%) of NHPs received by Adolfo
Lutz Institute, Brazil were reported as attacked by dogs. A high frequency of
young and debilitated animals was found. Myoglobinuria was observed in more than 
half animals (9/16; 56.2%), from which (5/9; 55.5%) presented ATN.
CONCLUSIONS: Kidney lesions are plausible findings in NHPs attacked by dogs.

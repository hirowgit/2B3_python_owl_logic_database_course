Antagonising the serotonin 2A (5-HT2A) receptor is an efficacious way to
alleviate dyskinesia and psychosis in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, previous
research indicates that there might be a limit to the effects conferred by this
approach. 5-HT2A receptors were shown to form hetero-dimers with metabotropic
glutamate 2 (mGlu2) receptors, in which 5-HT2A blockade and mGlu2 activation
elicit equivalent effects at the downstream signalling level. We have previously 
shown that mGlu2 activation reduces both dyskinesia and psychosis-like behaviours
(PLBs) induced by L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA), in the
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-lesioned primate. Here, we
hypothesised that concurrent 5-HT2A antagonism and mGlu2 activation would provide
greater anti-dyskinetic and anti-psychotic benefits than either approach alone.
We conducted 3 series of experiments in the MPTP-lesioned marmoset. In the first 
series of experiments, the mGlu2 positive allosteric modulator LY-487,379 and the
5-HT2A antagonist EMD-281,014, either alone or in combination, were added to
l-DOPA. In the second series of experiments, the mGlu2/3 orthosteric agonist
LY-354,740 and EMD-281,014, either alone or in combination, were added to l-DOPA.
In the last series of experiments, we investigated whether mGlu2 blockade would
diminish the effects of antagonising 5-HT2A receptors. To this end, the mGlu2/3
orthosteric antagonist LY-341,495 and EMD-281,014, either alone or in
combination, were added to l-DOPA. We found that the anti-dyskinetic effect of
the combination LY-487,379/EMD-281,014 was greater than the ones conferred by
LY-487,379 (by 35%, P < 0.05) and EMD-281,014 (by 38%, P < 0.01). The
anti-dyskinetic and anti-psychotic effects of the combination
LY-354,740/EMD-281,014 were also greater than the ones conferred by LY-354,740
(by 57% for dyskinesia and 54% for PLBs, both P < 0.001) and EMD-281,014 (by 61% 
for dyskinesia and 53% for PLBs, both P < 0.001). The anti-parkinsonian action of
l-DOPA was maintained with all treatments. Lastly, the addition of LY-341,495
abolished the therapeutic effects of EMD-281,014 on dyskinesia and PLBs. Our
results suggest that mGlu2 activation may enhance the anti-dyskinetic and
anti-psychotic effects of 5-HT2A blockade and could provide relief to PD patients
with dyskinesia and psychotic symptoms beyond what can be achieved with current
therapies.

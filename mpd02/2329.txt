We compared the mobbing response to model snakes of two groups of captive-born
common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) differing in genetic relatedness, age and
past experience. Mobbing vocalisations (tsik calls), other mobbing behaviour and 
attention to the stimulus were recorded for 2 min. intervals pre-exposure, during
exposure to various stimuli and post-exposure. Marmosets in one group were
vocally reactive to all stimuli, although more so to one particular stimulus
resembling rearing snakes and modified images of it, whereas the marmosets in a
younger and genetically unrelated group attended to the stimuli but made very few
mobbing calls. The parent stock of the first group had suffered stress in early
life and had developed a phobic response to a specific stimulus, which they had
transmitted to their offspring. A third group, matching the older group in age
range but genetically unrelated, was also found to be unresponsive to the
stimulus that elicited the strongest response in the first group. Cortisol levels
in samples of hair were assayed and a significant negative correlation was found 
between the number of tsik calls made during presentation of the stimuli and the 
cortisol level, showing that mobbing behaviour/behavioural reactivity is
associated with low levels of physiological stress.

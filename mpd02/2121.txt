The effect of nest box availability on the circadian activity rhythm (CAR) was
compared in a diurnal primate kept in two conditions: with and without nest box, 
in a light-dark (LD) cycle (12:12) and constant light (LL). Marmosets kept in LD 
without nest box showed a longer duration of the activity phase (alpha), smaller 
day-to-day variability in activity onset and offset and higher levels of
activity, particularly towards the end of the activity time. In LL, all animals
maintained with nest box expressed free-running CAR, but without nest box, 3 of
the 4 individuals showed relative coordination with the outdoor LD cycle,
possibly due to social synchronization with captive marmosets maintained
outdoors. All animals showed longer alpha and higher levels of activity without
nest box. Thus, the availability of a nest box is an important aspect in
maintaining marmosets, influencing CAR expression in this diurnal primate in LD
and LL conditions, possibly due to differences in light exposure that induces
masking. Further studies are needed to evaluate the effects of the unavailability
of a nest box on CAR in LL conditions.

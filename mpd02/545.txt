Affective disorders are associated with increased sensitivity to negative
feedback that influences approach-avoidance decision making. Although
neuroimaging studies of these disorders reveal dysregulation in primate cingulate
areas 25 and 32 and the anterior hippocampus (aHipp), the causal involvement of
these structures and their interaction in the primate brain is unknown. We
therefore investigated the effects of localized pharmacological manipulations of 
areas 25 and 32 and/or the aHipp of the marmoset monkey on performance of an
anxiolytic-sensitive instrumental decision-making task in which an
approach-avoidance conflict is created by pairing a response with reward and
punishment. During control infusions animals avoided punishment, but this bias
was reduced by increasing glutamate release within the aHipp or area 32, and
inactivation or 5-HT1a antagonism within area 25. Conversely, increasing
glutamate release in area 25 enhanced punishment avoidance but, in contrast to
previous reports, area 32 and aHipp inactivations had no effect. Simultaneous
inactivation or 5-HT1a antagonism within area 25, but not area 32, abolished the 
reduced punishment avoidance seen after increasing aHipp glutamate. Besides
providing causal evidence that these primate areas differentially regulate
negative feedback sensitivity, this study links the decision-making deficits in
affective disorders to aberrant aHipp-area 25 circuit activity.

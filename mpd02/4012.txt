The application of an in vitro microdialysis system (MDS) for studies on the
gonadotrophic control of luteal progesterone secretion in the marmoset monkey is 
described. Luteal tissue collected from a total of six animals (9 +/- 1 days
after ovulation) was perfused with Ringer solution (without and with lipoprotein,
0.6 microgram/ml). The tissue was exposed to repeated applications of human LH
(hLH) and human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) (1, 10 and 100 IU/ml) each of 60
min duration. Perfusate was collected in 15-min fractions and assayed for
progesterone content. Results showed that addition of lipoproteins to the Ringer 
solution had a marked effect of progesterone secretion in terms of maintaining
stable baseline levels and improving reproducibility of gonadotrophin-induced
responses. Progesterone secretion was significantly stimulated by both
gonadotrophins at each dose tested. Maximal elevations were obtained with 10
IU/ml and there were no apparent differences in responses to hLH and hCG in terms
of either magnitude or duration. This study indicates that MDS provides a useful 
in vitro approach for studying the gonadotrophic control of the corpus luteum in 
non-human primates. The results did not demonstrate disparate actions of hLH and 
hCG in their ability to stimulate luteal progesterone secretion.

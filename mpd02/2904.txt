Midbrain projections of the pretectal olivary nucleus (PON) were studied in the
marmoset, a New World primate. The fluorescent retrograde tracers Fluoro-Gold
(FG) and Fast Blue (FB) were injected into the Edinger-Westphal (EW) nucleus and 
the lateral terminal nucleus (LTN), respectively. EW nucleus injections resulted 
in retrograde labeling of significant numbers of FG-positive neurons of the PON
as well as a small number of cells in the LTN. LTN injections led to labeling of 
a population of singly-labeled cells seen dispersed through the larger population
of FG-labeled somata within the contralateral PON. The ipsilateral PON was devoid
of FB-labeled somata, whereas the adjacent nucleus of the optic tract (NOT)
contained FB-labeled cells. These findings show that a large number of PON
neurons project directly to the oculomotor complex. Additionally, the study shows
the presence of a separate population of PON neurons projecting to the
contralateral LTN. This, combined with our earlier observation that LTN neurons
project to the EW nucleus in the marmoset (see main text for reference), lends
support to the presence of separate direct and indirect pupillary light reflex
pathways from the PON to the nucleus of EW.

It has been reported that the signaling lymphocyte-activation molecule (SLAM),
the second receptor of Measles virus (MV) on the cell surface appears to be
downregulated by MV infection or by expression of MV hemagglutinin (H) (Tanaka et
al., 2002; Welsteadt et al., 2004). The aim of this study was to analyze this
phenomenon in more detail using a Chinese vaccine strain (S191) of MV. Flow
cytometry confirmed apparent downregulation of SLAM in the virus-infected cells
and in the cells transfected with a plasmid expressing viral H. Moreover, a
similar effect was obtained by incubation of the cells with UV-inactivated virus 
or soluble viral H. Real-time quantitative PCR showed that the SLAM mRNA level
remained stable during the virus infection, and Western blot analysis
demonstrated that the SLAM content of total membrane proteins did not change
change after the virus infection. Thus we conclude that SLAM expression is stable
during the MV infection and that its apparent downregulation reported earlier and
confirmed also in this study was just the result of masking of the antibody
recognition sites on SLAM with MV H during the flow cytometry assay.

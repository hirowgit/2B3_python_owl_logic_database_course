Monosynaptic projections from the cerebral cortex to the vestibular nuclei were
studied in the common marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus) by injecting
fluorescent dextrans into the brain stem vestibular nuclei. The injection sites
were determined by single unit vestibular responses identified later
histologically. During the recordings sinewave rotation in pitch, roll or yaw or 
steady tilt was applied. The most notable loci of labelling were found inside the
primary sensory cortex, the cortex deep down along the posterior lateral sulcus, 
the premotor region and the anterior cingulate cortex. From studies in other
primates these cortical areas are known to process vestibular information. Their 
connections with the vestibular nuclei may serve as an internal feedback
modulating the vestibular brain stem activity.

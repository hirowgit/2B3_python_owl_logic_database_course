PURPOSE: Abnormality of the brain norepinephrine transporter (NET) has been
reported in several psychiatric and neuronal disorders. Since NET is an important
target for the diagnosis of these diseases, the development of
radiopharmaceuticals for imaging of brain NET has been eagerly awaited. In this
study, we synthesized (S,S)-2-(alpha-(2-iodophenoxy)benzyl)morpholine
[(S,S)-IPBM], a derivative of reboxetine iodinated at position 2 of the phenoxy
ring, and evaluated its potential as a radiopharmaceutical for imaging brain NET 
using SPECT.
METHODS: (S,S)-(123/125)I-IPBM was synthesized in a halogen exchange reaction.
The affinity and selectivity of (S,S)-IPBM for NET was measured by assaying the
displacement of (3)H-nisoxetine and (S,S)-(125)I-IPBM from the binding site in
rat brain membrane, respectively. The biodistribution of (S,S)-(125)I-IPBM was
also determined in rats. Furthermore, SPECT studies with (S,S)-(123)I-IPBM were
carried out in the common marmoset.
RESULTS: (S,S)-(125)I-IPBM was prepared with high radiochemical yields (65%) and 
high radiochemical purity (>98%). (S,S)-IPBM showed high affinity and selectivity
for NET in the binding assay experiments. In biodistribution experiments,
(S,S)-(125)I-IPBM showed rapid uptake in the brain, and the regional cerebral
distribution was consistent with the density of NET. The administration of
nisoxetine, a selective NET-binding agent, decreased the accumulation of
(S,S)-(125)I-IPBM in the brain, but the administration of selective serotonin
transporter and dopamine transporter binding agents caused no significant changes
in the accumulation. Moreover, (S,S)-(123)I-IPBM allowed brain NET imaging in the
common marmoset with SPECT.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that (S,S)-(123)I-IPBM is a potential SPECT
radiopharmaceutical for imaging brain NET.

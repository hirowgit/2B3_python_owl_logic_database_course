Hunger and thirst are fundamental biological processes that drive consumption
behavior in humans and non-human animals. While the existing literature in
neuroscience suggests that these satiety states change how consumable rewards are
represented in the brain, it remains unclear as to how they change animal choice 
behavior and the underlying economic preferences. Here, I used combined
techniques from experimental economics, psychology, and neuroscience to measure
food preferences of marmoset monkeys (Callithrix jacchus), a recently developed
primate model for neuroscience. Hunger states of animals were manipulated by
scheduling feeding intervals, resulting in three different conditions: sated,
non-sated, and hungry. During these hunger states, animals performed pairwise
choices of food items, which included all possible pairwise combinations of five 
different food items except for same-food pairs. Results showed that hunger
enhanced economic rationality, evident as a decrease of transitivity violations
(item A was preferred to item B, and B to C, but C was preferred to A). Further
analysis demonstrated that hungry monkeys chose more-preferred items over
less-preferred items in a more deterministic manner, while the individual food
preferences appeared to remain stable across hunger states. These results suggest
that hunger enhances consistent choice behavior and shifts animals towards
efficient outcome maximization.

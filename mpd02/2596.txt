Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) induced by myelin-oligodendrocyte
glycoprotein (MOG) in common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) is a model for
multiple sclerosis. Here, EAE was induced in four common marmosets by 250-300
microg recombinant rat MOG. In addition to a detailed disability scoring, T2- and
T1-weighted high-resolution 3D MRI was performed to assess the onset and
development of cerebral lesions. The findings were confirmed by histopathology in
all animals. Although the animals exhibited a large heterogeneity with regard to 
onset and localization of lesions and also to disease duration and severity of
disability signs, none of the animals revealed any evidence of recovery. A
specification of the disability scoring system to account for different aspects
of the disease led to a good concurrence of the first MRI-detectable lesion and
the onset of central nervous system (CNS) symptoms. The results suggest that MRI 
monitoring of white matter lesions in conjunction with disability scores that
focus on CNS symptoms may be a suitable method to evaluate novel therapeutic
interventions even in the presence of pronounced interindividual heterogeneity.

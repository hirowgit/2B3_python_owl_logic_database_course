This chapter examines the importance of studying hand preference together with
different expressions of behavior. Cognitive differences between left- and
right-handed primates are discussed. As shown in several species of primate, eye 
preference, but not hand preference, is biased at the level of the population and
reflects hemispheric asymmetry of processing. Hand preference, determined from
simple grasping of pieces of food and taking them to the mouth, is consistent for
individuals but it is not population biased. It is a measure of an individual's
preference to use a particular hemisphere, and hence which cognitive processes
are characteristic of the individual. Compared to left-handed subjects,
right-handed subjects are more active in exploring novel objects, show more
social facilitation of behavior, have a positive cognitive bias, and express
lower levels of fear and stress responses. In marmosets, learning of food
searching tasks is not associated with hand preference. Strength of hand
preference, rather than its direction, is linked to the ability to perform two
tasks at once, viz., detection of a predator while searching for food. Marmosets 
with strong hand preferences are able to perform these two tasks at once but
those with weak or no hand preference are unable to do so.

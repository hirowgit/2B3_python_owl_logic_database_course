Callitrichid primates typically give birth to twin offspring that are somatic
chimeras of cells derived from two products of conception. Each individual is
thus the phenotype of two sibling genotypes, one of which may be more closely
related to the germ line of the individual's parents than to the individual's own
germ line. Chimerism could therefore help to explain the evolution of
alloparental care and social suppression of reproduction in callitrichids.
Placental chimerism may also have important implications for understanding kin
interactions within the womb: on one side of the coin, the intimate juxtaposition
of genotypes provides unique opportunities for antagonistic interactions between 
embryos; on the other side, chimerism could facilitate cooperation between
sibling genotypes.

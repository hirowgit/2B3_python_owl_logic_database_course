Humans produce four different forms of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) mRNA via
alternative splicing of the gene. Here we demonstrate that New- and Old-World
monkeys and the gorilla produce only two of the TH isoforms. Comparison among the
genomic DNA sequences of various primates revealed that mutations that had
accumulated in the genomic DNA created a new exon, resulting in the appearance of
two new TH isoforms in man. These findings offer new insight into the sequence of
events leading to the evolution of the higher primates into separate species.
They also represent what may be the first evidence of a genetic difference
between man and primates with respect to a specific brain function.

In this paper we present a mathematical analysis of the basic model for target
mediated drug disposition (TMDD). Assuming high affinity of ligand to target, we 
give a qualitative characterisation of ligand versus time graphs for different
dosing regimes and derive accurate analytic approximations of different phases in
the temporal behaviour of the system. These approximations are used to estimate
model parameters, give analytical approximations of such quantities as area under
the ligand curve and clearance. We formulate conditions under which a suitably
chosen Michaelis-Menten model provides a good approximation of the full
TMDD-model over a specified time interval.

Field studies of callitrichid species have reported a surprising degree of
variation in the composition of social groups, some of which has been interpreted
as evidence of 'cooperative polyandry' in recent reviews. The majority of the
evidence is, however, derived from studies of only one of the four callitrichid
genera, Saguinus. While most features of the morphology and behaviour of all
callitrichid species are broadly similar, studies of marmosets (Callithrix spp.
and Cebuella pygmaea) indicate that important ecological differences exist
between genera. These differences appear, in turn, to be reflected in marked
contrasts in both social organisation and mating systems. A re-evaluation of the 
social organisation of the callitrichids, based on differences in their
ecological adaptations, is presented.

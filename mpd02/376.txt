Speciation is associated with substantial rewiring of the regulatory circuitry
underlying the expression of genes. Determining which changes are relevant and
underlie the emergence of the human brain or its unique susceptibility to neural 
disease has been challenging. Here we annotate changes to gene regulatory
elementsÂ (GREs) at cell type resolution in the brains of multiple primate species
spanning most of primate evolution. We identify a unique set of regulatory
elements that emerged in hominins prior to the separation of humans and
chimpanzees. We demonstrate that these hominin gains perferentially affect
oligodendrocyte function postnatally and are preferentially affected in the
brains of autism patients. This preference is also observed for human-specific
GREs suggesting this system is under continued selective pressure. Our data
provide a roadmap of regulatory rewiring across primate evolution providing
insight into the genomic changes that underlie the emergence of the brain and its
susceptibility to neural disease.

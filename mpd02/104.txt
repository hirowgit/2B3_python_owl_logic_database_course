The common marmoset, a New World monkey, has a primate-specific cortex with
approximately 40 Brodmann areas. Genetically encoded calcium indicator (GECI)
techniques have been applied to study the functional organization of the marmoset
cortex. The success of GCaMP (a green fluorescent of GECI) imaging and other
advances, including optogenetic approaches, provide an interesting and exciting
opportunity to study the primate brain at the molecular and cellular levels,
leading to an understanding of primate neural circuits. These approaches will
help advance our knowledge on cognition in primates, including humans, and
therapy for human neurological and psychiatric disorders.

Characterizing the phenotypic changes associated with aging in a short-lived
primate is necessary in order to develop better translational models for human
health, aging, and disease research. A population of conventionally housed
marmoset monkeys was assessed to determine if phenotypes of body composition,
hematology, and morphometrical measures were associated with age or risk of
death. We found that the cause of mortality in older marmosets was more likely to
be due to cardiac and chronic kidney disease than in younger marmosets. Older
marmosets have decreased fat mass, morphometric measures, and serum albumin.
Older marmosets are more likely to show a modified posture while at rest and this
modified posture was significantly associated with an increased risk of imminent 
death. These assessments provide an initial definition of aged health in
marmosets and a base for future translational aging research with this species.

In the visual cortex of rabbits and a marmoset monkey, 32 and 64 microwires,
respectively, were chronically implanted by an indirect insertion method so that 
the cortex was penetrated from the white matter. For more than 1 year recordings 
of action potentials of good quality were obtained at most electrodes. Recording 
stability was judged by spike shape, spike train autocorrelograms, and spike
rates: within recording sessions, stability was essentially perfect. Periods in
which the signals of several electrodes were stable could last for several days. 
A method of in vivo reconstruction of the electrode locations by micro-X-rays and
subsequent stereophotogrammetry is presented. The aspect of animal welfare is
considered.

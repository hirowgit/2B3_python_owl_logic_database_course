Marmosets normally produce dizygotic twins sharing placental blood vessels and
exchanging bone marrow cells. Each individual is therefore likely to be a blood
chimaera. To date, marmosets had only been DNA fingerprinted using blood samples 
and probes 33.6 and 33.15, resulting in highly similar fingerprints among litter 
mates and little variation between other individuals, thereby limiting this
method's use for individual identification and parentage testing. In this study, 
novel probes were applied to detect greater polymorphism and to produce
individual-specific DNA fingerprints. As expected, blood DNA profiles of twins
and triplets were virtually identical, confirming chimaerism in this tissue and
identifying litter mates. Furthermore, these profiles were sufficiently variable 
to distinguish between sibs from different litters and between all other
individuals. To produce individual-specific DNA fingerprints, the use of DNA
extracted from tissues poor in leukocytes was essential. The findings demonstrate
that, despite extensive blood chimaerism, marmoset colonies can be effectively
DNA fingerprinted for indicidual identification, zygosity testing, and
relationship studies.

A new heterotopic callosal projection of primary visual cortex in the monkey,
Callithrix jacchus.

Spatz WB, Kunz B, Steffen H.

A callosal projection of area 17 upon the dorsomedial visual area in the marmoset
monkey was demonstrated by means of retrograde transport of neuronal tracers. The
projection was restricted to those regions representing the vertical meridian in 
the two areas. This finding, and the data of other authors, indicate that the
monkey area 17 projects transcallosally onto homotopic and several heterotopic
targets.

Most patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) develop dyskinesia and other motor
complications after prolonged L-dopa use. We now report on the relationship
between L-dopa dose and the duration and severity of dyskinesia in L-dopa-primed 
MPTP-treated primates with marked nigral degeneration mimicking late stage PD.
With increasing doses of L-dopa, locomotor activity increased and motor
disability declined. The duration of dyskinesia following L-dopa administration
increased dose-dependently, and showed a linear correlation with total locomotor 
activity. In addition, the time-course of dyskinesia paralleled closely that of
locomotor activity in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, severity of
dyskinesia showed a non-linear correlation with total locomotor activity, low
doses of L-dopa eliciting severe dyskinesia for short periods of time. The
threshold for dyskinesia induction and the antiparkinsonian effects of L-dopa
appear very similar in primed MPTP primates mimicking late stage PD. Reducing
individual doses of L-dopa to avoid severe dyskinesia can markedly compromise the
antiparkinsonian response. Our results extend the relevance of the dyskinetic
MPTP-treated primate in studying the genesis of involuntary movements occurring
in L-dopa treated patients with PD.

BACKGROUND: Novel imaging technology and procedures were developed to study brain
function in preadolescent awake marmosets never exposed to anesthesia.
METHODS: A radiofrequency transmit and receive, head only volume coil was
designed and integrated into a holding system. An acclimation procedure was
developed without the use of anesthesia or sedation that allowed for awake
imaging. Preadolescent 8-month old male and female marmosets were imaged for
resting state BOLD functional connectivity to assess the status of the default
mode network. Levels of reactivity during acclimation sessions and behavioral
stress following imaging were assessed.
RESULTS: Data on functional coupling in the default mode network suggest the
organization of connectivity to the prefrontal cortex is not fully developed at 8
months of age. The stress associated with the imaging procedure is comparable to 
that observed when marmosets are removed from their home cage and temporarily
isolated from the family.
COMPARISON TO OTHER METHODS: The design of the radiofrequency coil provides B1
homogeneity across the entire brain without signal drop off. The unique design of
the head cradle obviates the need for any stabilizing surgery, ear bars or bite
bar and could be adapted to any size marmoset. The acclimation requires no
anesthesia or sedation at any time in the early life of the developing marmoset, 
a condition that better reflects the human experience.
CONCLUSION: A method is provided for imaging functional activity in the brain of 
fully awake preadolescent marmosets without any history of anesthesia or
sedation.

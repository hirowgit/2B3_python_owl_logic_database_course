BACKGROUND: Virus-associated haemophagocytic syndrome (VAHS) is a fatal
complication of viral infections, such as Epstein-Barr virus and H5N1 influenza, 
that results from macrophage activation and pro inflammatory cytokine injuries.
The high comorbidity and mortality of current therapy urgently demands an ideal
agent based on VAHS pathogenesis. Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor
(PPAR) agonists, regulators of metabolic syndrome, can exhibit immunomodulatory
effects on macrophage activation and cytokine secretion.
METHODS: In this study, we adopted rosiglitazone, a PPAR-gamma agonist, for VAHS 
control in a Herpesvirus papio (HVP)-infected rabbit model. Various doses of
rosiglitazone were orally administered to rabbits on day 7 or day 20 after
intravenous challenge with 5 x 10(7) copies of HVP.
RESULTS: The rabbits that received 4 mg/day rosiglitazone had significantly
increased survival when treated at an early stage of infection (P<0.01), whereas 
a higher dose (8 mg/day) was required at the advanced stage of the disease
(P<0.05). All rosiglitazone-treated rabbits had significantly improved laboratory
parameters and plasma tumour necrosis factor-alpha levels. Importantly,
rosiglitazone could also inhibit viral replication in vitro and in vivo.
CONCLUSIONS: PPAR agonists could represent a potentially new agent for the
therapy of VAHS.

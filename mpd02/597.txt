BACKGROUND: Small-animal MRI is an important investigative tool for basic and
preclinical research. High-resolution anatomical and functional studies of the
brain require artifact-free images that are acquired with a highly sensitive
radiofrequency (RF) coil.
NEW METHOD: The animal holder plays an important role in mitigating image
artifacts: motion artifacts are reduced by immobilizing the animal and
geometric-distortion artifacts are reduced by accurately positioning the animal
to improve static-field shimming. The RF coil, in turn, must provide high
sensitivity over the whole brain and not physically interfere with the animal
holder. To accomplish these tasks, the animal holder and RF coil should be
designed in tandem. In this manuscript, animal holders and RF coils for mice,
rats, and marmoset monkeys are described. Each animal holder includes components 
for anesthesia delivery and animal immobilization, as well as a compatible
receive coil.
RESULTS/COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHOD(S): Animal holders were capable of
accurate and reproducible positioning (for the marmoset, this was in the
stereotactic plane), consequently reducing geometric distortion in echo-planar
images. Ear bars were designed in conjunction with receive-coil formers, thereby 
maximizing the sensitive region of coils, while concurrently reducing motion to
less than a pixel over EPI time series. Motion and SNR were quantified to
facilitate direct comparison to existing animal holders and RF coils. All
computer-aided-design (CAD) files of animal holders and RF coils are provided to 
promote dissemination.
CONCLUSIONS: The confluence of design between the animal holder and RF coil
provides a pragmatic solution for routine imaging of small animals.

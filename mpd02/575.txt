Chitin is a polymer of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc) and a main constituent of 
insects' exoskeleton. Insects are rich in protein with high energy conversion
efficiency. Recently, we have reported that acidic chitinases (Chia) act as
digestive enzymes in mouse, pig and chicken (omnivorous) but not in dog
(carnivorous) and bovine (herbivorous), indicating that feeding behavior affects 
Chia expression levels, and determines chitin digestibility in the particular
animals. Common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) belongs to New World monkey family 
and provides a potential bridge between mouse models and human diseases. Common
marmoset is an insectivorous nonhuman primate with unknown expression levels and 
enzymatic functions of the Chia homologue, CHIA. Here, we report that common
marmoset highly expresses pepsin-, trypsin- and chymotrypsin-resistant CHIA in
the stomach. We show that CHIA is most active at pH 2.0 and degrades chitin and
mealworm shells into GlcNAc dimers under gastrointestinal conditions. Although
common marmoset and crab-eating monkey (Old World monkey) have two CHIA genes in 
their genomes, they primarily express one gene in the stomach. Thus, this study
is the first to investigate expression levels and enzymatic functions of CHIA in 
a New World primate, contributing to the understanding of dietary adaptation and 
digestion in this taxon.

Identification of a suitable nonhuman primate (NHP) model of COVID-19 remains
challenging. Here, we characterized severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in three NHP species: Old World monkeys Macaca mulatta
(M. mulatta) and Macaca fascicularis (M. fascicularis) and New World monkey
Callithrix jacchus (C. jacchus). Infected M. mulatta and M. fascicularis showed
abnormal chest radiographs, an increased body temperature and a decreased body
weight. Viral genomes were detected in swab and blood samples from all animals.
Viral load was detected in the pulmonary tissues of M. mulatta and M.
fascicularis but not C. jacchus. Furthermore, among the three animal species, M. 
mulatta showed the strongest response to SARS-CoV-2, including increased
inflammatory cytokine expression and pathological changes in the pulmonary
tissues. Collectively, these data revealed the different susceptibilities of Old 
World and New World monkeys to SARS-CoV-2 and identified M. mulatta as the most
suitable for modeling COVID-19.

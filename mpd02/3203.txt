Intense physiological angiogenesis occurs during the early stages of luteal
development, providing a model in which the complex processes regulating the
angiogenic pathway may be studied. Here, a working hypothesis is presented to
explain the diverse changes in the vasculature of the corpus luteum that occur
over a short period, based around changes in vascular endothelial growth factor, 
the angiopoietins and matrix metalloproteinases. An illustration is given of how 
angiogenesis can be monitored in a primate model and how the role of individual
angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor may be explored in 
vivo. Because of the marked effect of inhibition of angiogenesis on luteal
function, it is predicted that the normal processes of follicular development,
ovulation and luteal function could all be profoundly influenced by the
manipulation of angiogenesis.

Changes in brain-stem auditory evoked potentials (BAEPs) with age were recorded
in common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) at the age of 1-2, 6-8 and 10-12 years. 
The auditory function was assessed by thresholds, latencies and amplitudes of
BAEPs evoked by use of tone burst stimulations with audible frequencies ranging
from 1 to 99 kHz. Prolongation of the latencies of later waves was observed in
the animals at the age of 6-8 and 10-12 years at high frequencies, suggesting
that aging in marmosets, as reported previously in humans and other animals, may 
cause earlier hearing loss at high frequency than at low frequency within the
hearing range. At 10-12 years of age, the elevations of BAEP thresholds and the
declines of BAEP amplitudes in older animals were also observed. As the
differences in the parameters are small, it was suggested that only a moderate
hearing loss occurred with onset late in life in common marmoset similar to that 
in CBA/Ca mice. Based on the results obtained in this study, BAEP latencies
appear to be more sensitive indicators than BAEP thresholds and amplitudes for
the early detection of hearing impairment.

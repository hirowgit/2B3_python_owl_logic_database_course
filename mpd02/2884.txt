Using positive reinforcement, J. McKinley trained 12 common marmosets (Callithrix
jacchus) to provide urine samples on request. The study then exposed the
marmosets to mildly stressful, routine husbandry procedures (i.e., capture and
weighing). The nonhuman animals spent less time inactive poststressor as opposed 
to prestressor. L. Bassett collected matched behavioral data from 12 nontrained
marmosets who were less accustomed to human interaction. These animals spent
significantly more time self-scratching and locomoting as well as less time
inactive, poststressor. Collapsed data from the 2 populations showed increased
scent marking, poststressor. These results suggest that locomotion,
self-scratching, and scent marking are useful, noninvasive behavioral measures of
stress and, thus, reduced welfare in the common marmoset. Overall, nontrained
animals showed more self-scratching than did their trained counterparts. It was
not possible to collect urine from nontrained marmosets. In response to the
stressor, however, trained animals showed no significant change in excreted
urinary cortisol. These results suggest that training marmosets may allow them to
cope better with routine laboratory procedures.

Callithrix penicillata belongs to the family Callitrichidae, Callithrix genus.
They are basically insectivorous, but they consume fruits. The mucosa of the
tongue is composed of some papillary types, revealing different levels of
expertise. The present study attempted to describe the morphological and
ultrastructural aspects of the dorsal surface of the C. penicillata, describing
the characteristics and distribution of papillae found. Five tongues of C.
penicillata (two females and three males), obtained from breeding colonies of
CENP-Ananindeua-PA, died from natural causes. The material was fixed partly in a 
buffer solution paraformaldehyde 10% and partly in modified Karnovsky solution,
divided into apex, body, and root, and then the fragments were used in light
microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The average length of the tongue of 
the females was 22 mm and for males 20.5 mm. Three types of papillae were
described: filiform (along all tissue extension with 154 μm of diameter),
fungiform (along all tissue extension with 275 μm of diameter), and vallate (just
three units in caudal (dorsal) portion with 672 μm of diameter). Data analysis
indicates that the distribution and ultrastructural morphology of the C.
penicillata lingual papillae are some similar to other primates.

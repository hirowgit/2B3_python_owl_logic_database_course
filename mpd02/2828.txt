New insights are presented into the collagenous structure of the primate cornea. 
Wide-angle X-ray diffraction was used to map the fibrillar arrangement and
distribution of collagen over three common marmoset corneas. The maps provide a
point of reference to help interpret data from pathological corneas or primate
models of refractive surgery. The results herein disclose a circum-corneal
annulus of highly aligned collagen, 0.5-1.5 mm wide, where the cornea and sclera 
fuse at the limbus; a feature similar to that observed in human tissue. As in
humans, the annulus is not uniform, varying in width, fibril angular spread, and 
collagen density around its circumference. However, more centrally the marmoset
cornea exhibits a preferred lamella orientation in which proportionally more
fibrils are oriented along the superior-inferior corneal meridian. This
observation is in striking contrast with the situation in human cornea, where
there is an orthogonal arrangement of preferentially aligned fibrils.
Investigation of a further 16 corneas confirmed that approximately 33% (+/-1%) (n
= 76) of fibrils in the central marmoset cornea lie within a 45 degrees sector of
the superior-inferior meridian. Implications for the mechanical and optical
properties of the cornea are discussed.

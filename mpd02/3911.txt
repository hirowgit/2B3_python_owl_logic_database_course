In callitrichids, and especially in the Callithrix and Saguinus genera,
reproductive suppression maintains the breeding exclusivity of dominant females. 
It has been suggested that dominance may be inferred from agonistic behavior of
females. The purpose of this study was to assess the adequacy of behaviors as
indicators of hormonal status in Callithrix jacchus females. Two pairs of twin
females were observed for affiliative, agonistic and sexual behaviors for 20
weeks, in four stages of increasingly potential competition for one male. During 
the same period, blood samples were taken regularly for progesterone
determination by ELISA. The two pairs differed markedly as to behaviors and
hormonal status: pair 1 showed a well established behavioral dominance and only
one ovulating female from the beginning of the observation period; pair 2 showed 
competition for dominance until the last stage of observation, when one of the
females started ovulating. Correlations between behaviors and progesterone levels
showed differences between subordinate and dominant females mostly in pair 2.
Although limited in number of animals studied, these results suggest that there
is a relationship between behavior and hormones in female marmosets, but this
relationship may be useful in the identification of the physiological status of
females only in groups where the dominance is not well established.

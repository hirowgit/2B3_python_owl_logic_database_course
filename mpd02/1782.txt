The present study describes how the development of a pair bond modifies social,
sexual and aggressive behavior. Five heterosexual pairs of marmosets, previously 
unknown to each other, were formed at the beginning of the study. At the onset of
pairing, social, sexual, exploratory and aggressive behaviors were recorded for
40 min. The animals were then observed for 20 min, both in the morning and
afternoon for 21 days. The frequency and/or duration of behaviors recorded on Day
1 were compared to those recorded at later observations. The behavior displayed
shortly after pairing should be completely unaffected by the pair bond, while
such a bond should be present at later observations. Thus, it was possible to
determine how the behavior between the pair was modified by the development of a 
pair bond. Social behaviors increased from Day 1 to Days 2-6 and all subsequent
days observed. Conversely, other behaviors, such as open mouth displays (usually 
considered to be an invitation to sexual activity), had a high frequency during
the early part of cohabitation but declined towards the end. Consequently, pair
bonding manifests itself in an increased intensity of social behaviors. It is
suggested that the intrinsically rewarding properties of grooming and perhaps
other social behaviors turn the pair mate into a positive incentive, activating
approach and further interactions when possible. Thus, the pair bond may be a
motivational state activated by the conditioned incentive properties of the
partner. This notion can explain all forms of pair bonds, including those
occurring between individuals of the same sex and in promiscuous species.

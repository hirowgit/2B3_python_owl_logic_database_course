BACKGROUND: Common marmoset monkeys (Callithrix jacchus) are readily used in
biomedical research. However, superovulation for embryonic stem cell production
and developmental research still remain difficult. Inexplicably,
follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) as key player in superovulation has to be
administered in extremely high dosages in this non-human primate compared to
human.
METHODS: To evaluate whether marmoset FSH (cjFSH) is functionally more competent 
than its human homologue on the marmoset FSH receptor (cjFSHR), we established in
vitro a homologous system characterizing homologous and recombinantly produced
cjFSH.
RESULTS: Upon stimulation of two cell lines stably expressing either the marmoset
or the human FSH receptor (cj/hFSHR), respectively, the second messenger
signaling of the activated receptor displayed no significant difference in ED(50)
values. Thermostability of cjFSH was significantly prolonged by roughly 20% on
both FSHRs.
CONCLUSION: High FSH dosage in marmoset superovulation cannot be explained by
enhanced biopotency of the natural animal's gonadotropin.

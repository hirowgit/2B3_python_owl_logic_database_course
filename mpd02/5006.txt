Pigmy marmoset as an experimental animal.

SOBEL H, MONDON CE, MEANS CV.

The pigmy marmoset has been maintained under laboratory conditions for
approximately (1/2) years. A synthetic diet has been prepared, which includes
milk, eggs, and lard, which may cause fourfold increase in serum cholesterol
levels. This species is proposed as an experimental subject for the study of
aging and age-associated diseases.

We have studied the effect of intravenous injection of interleukin-1 (dose range:
from 0.25 to 4.5 microg/kg of body weight) on plasma ACTH and cortisol levels in 
the marmoset, a primate paradygm of peripheral glucocorticoid resistance. Blood
sampling were collected and body temperature recorded 0, 15, 30, 60, 120, 180,
240 and 300 min after injection. Interleukin-1 stimulated secretion of ACTH in a 
dose-dependent fashion. Maximal secretion occurred 120 min after injection, and
lasted up to 240 min. Plasma ACTH levels returned to baseline 300 min after
interleukin-1 injection. Plasma cortisol levels were related to ACTH levels. Body
temperature elevation, which occurred 10-15 min after injection was
dose-dependent, and lasted 3 h. Results suggest that the pyrogenic effect of
interleukin is associated, in the marmoset, with integrated activation of the
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. In light of the proneness of marmosets to
hyperimmune disorders, our data are consistent with the hypothesized central
biological role of IL-1, as well as the pathophysiological relevance of the
neuro-endocrine-immune cross-talk during the acute phase response.

Cerebral dopamine neurotrophic factor (CDNF) belongs to a newly discovered family
of evolutionarily conserved neurotrophic factors. We demonstrate for the first
time a therapeutic effect of CDNF in a unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)
lesion model of Parkinson's disease in marmoset monkeys. Furthermore, we tested
the impact of high chronic doses of human recombinant CDNF on unlesioned monkeys 
and analyzed the amino acid sequence of marmoset CDNF. The severity of 6-OHDA
lesions and treatment effects were monitored in vivo using 123I-FP-CIT (DaTSCAN) 
SPECT. Quantitative analysis of 123I-FP-CIT SPECT showed a significant increase
of dopamine transporter binding activity in lesioned animals treated with CDNF.
Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), a well-characterized and
potent neurotrophic factor for dopamine neurons, served as a control in a
parallel comparison with CDNF. By contrast with CDNF, only single animals
responded to the treatment with GDNF, but no statistical difference was observed 
in the GDNF group. However, increased numbers of tyrosine hydroxylase
immunoreactive neurons, observed within the lesioned caudate nucleus of
GDNF-treated animals, indicate a strong bioactive potential of GDNF.

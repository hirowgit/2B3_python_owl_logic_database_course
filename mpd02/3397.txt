It was shown by Southern hybridization that cotton-top tamarin and common
marmoset, New World monkeys, carry three or more genes encoding
beta-microseminoprotein, also known as PSP94. In contrast, the genomes of Old
World monkeys, as represented by rhesus macaque and sacred baboon, contain a
single gene. Clones containing three different genes encoding
beta-microseminoprotein were isolated from a cotton-top tamarin genomic library. 
They carry two complete genes of four exons and a third gene lacking the first
exon. The structure suggests that the three genes are functionally active and
give rise to transcripts that are approximately 86% similar in sequence. By
sequencing one gene in full, it was shown that the introns carry an excess of
interspersed repeats, on average 29% of the introns consist of Alu repeats. A
phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the genes probably arose in New World
monkeys after the separation from Old World primates.

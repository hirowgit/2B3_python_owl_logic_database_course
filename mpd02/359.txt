BACKGROUND: Yellow fever (YF) is a severe, infectious, but non-communicable
arboviral hemorrhagic disease. In the last decades, yellow fever virus (YFV)
infections have been prevalent in endemic areas in Brazil, affecting human and
non-human primate (NHP) populations. Monitoring of NHP infection started in 1999,
and reports of epizootic diseases are considered important indicators of viral
transmission, particularly in relation to the sylvatic cycle. This study presents
the monitoring of YFV by real-time RT-PCR and the epidemiological findings
related to the deaths of NHPs in the south-eastern states and in the
north-eastern state of Bahia, during the outbreak of YF in Brazil during 2017 and
2018.
METHODS: A total of 4198 samples from 2099 NHPs from south-eastern and
north-eastern Brazilian states were analyzed by real-time reverse transcription
polymerase chain reaction (rtRT-PCR).
RESULTS: A total of 4198 samples from 2099 NHPs from south-eastern and
north-eastern Brazilian states were collected between 2017 and 2018. The samples 
were subjected to molecular diagnostics for YFV detection using real-time reverse
transcription polymerase chain reaction (rtRT-PCR) techniques. Epizootics were
coincident with human YF cases. Furthermore, our results showed that the YF
frequency was higher among marmosets (Callithrix sp.) than in previous reports.
Viremia in species of the genus Alouatta and Callithrix differed greatly.
DISCUSSION: Our results indicate a need for further investigation of the role of 
Callithrix spp. in the transmission cycles of YFV in Brazil. In particular, YFV
transmission was observed in a region where viral circulation has not been
recorded for decades and thus vaccination has not been previously recommended.
CONCLUSIONS: This highlights the need to straighten epizootic surveillance and
evaluate the extent of vaccination programmes in Brazil in previously considered 
"YFV-free" areas of the country.

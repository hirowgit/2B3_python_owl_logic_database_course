MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) was incidentally administered
to pregnant marmosets during the whole gestational period, except for the last 15
days before term. The infant monkeys were killed 5 months after birth, and
dopamine and its metabolites were measured in the striatum and the nucleus
accumbens. Prenatal exposure to MPTP produced a marked dopamine depletion in
these brain regions of the offspring, showing that MPTP is able to cross the
placental barrier in primates.

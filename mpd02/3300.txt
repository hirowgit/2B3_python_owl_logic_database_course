Comparative neuropathological studies of 1,6-dichloro-1,
6-dideoxy-beta-D-fructofuranosyl-4-chloro-4-deoxy-alpha-D-galactopyra noside
(sucralose), an equimolar mixture of 1,6-dichloro-1, 6-dideoxyfructose (1,6-DCF) 
and 4-chloro-4-deoxygalactose (4-CG), the hydrolysis products of sucralose, and
6-chloro-6-deoxyglucose (6-CG) were conducted in male and female mice and male
marmoset monkeys, focusing on morphological changes in the central nervous
system. 6-Chloro-6-deoxyglucose, previously reported to produce neurotoxic
effects, served as the positive control and was administered by gavage at a daily
dose of 500mg/kg. Sucralose and the sucralose hydrolysis products (sucralose-HP) 
were similarly administered to mice and marmosets at doses of up to 1000mg/kg for
21 and 28 days, respectively. No changes were detected in the central nervous
system by light or electron microscopy in either of the species that received
sucralose or its hydrolysis products. 6-Chloro-6-deoxyglucose, in contrast,
induced symmetrical lesions in the deep nuclei of the cerebellum, brain stem and 
spinal cord with definitive neurological signs of CNS involvement.

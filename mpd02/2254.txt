Successful adaptation to changes in an animal's emotional and motivational
environment depends on behavioral flexibility accompanied by changes in bodily
responses, e.g., autonomic and endocrine, which support the change in behavior.
Here, we identify the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) as pivotal in the flexible
regulation and coordination of behavioral and autonomic responses during
adaptation. Using an appetitive Pavlovian task, we demonstrate that OFC lesions
in the marmoset (i) impair an animal's ability to rapidly suppress its appetitive
cardiovascular arousal upon termination of a conditioned stimulus and (ii) cause 
an uncoupling of the behavioral and autonomic components of the adaptive response
after reversal of the reward contingencies. These findings highlight the role of 
the OFC in emotional regulation and are highly relevant to our understanding of
disorders such as schizophrenia and autism in which uncoupling of emotional
responses may contribute to the experiential distress and disadvantageous
behavior associated with these disorders.

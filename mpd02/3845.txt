PURPOSE: The goal of this study was to find a rational and reliable method of
using animal data to predict the clearance of metabolised drugs in humans.
METHODS: One such approach is to use in vitro liver models (e.g. hepatocytes and 
microsomes) to determine the relative capacities of the various animal species
and humans to metabolise the test compound. These data can then be combined with 
the in vivo clearances in animals, to calculate the in vivo clearance in humans
using allometric scaling techniques. In this study, this approach was evaluated
with a new endothelin receptor antagonist, bosentan, which is eliminated mainly
through metabolism and is characterized by very large interspecies differences in
clearance. Therefore, this compound provided a stringent test of our new
extrapolation method for allometric scaling.
RESULTS: The results obtained with bosentan showed that adjusting the in vivo
clearance in the different animal species for the relative rates of metabolism in
vitro gave a far better prediction of human clearance than an empirical
correcting factor (brain weight).
CONCLUSIONS: This approach provided a more rational basis for predicting the
clearance of metabolised compounds in humans.

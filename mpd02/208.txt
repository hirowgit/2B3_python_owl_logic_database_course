The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) has attracted considerable attention,
especially in the biomedical science and neuroscience research fields, because of
its potential to recapitulate the complex and multidimensional phenotypes of
human diseases, and several neurodegenerative transgenic models have been
reported. However, there remain several issues as (i) it takes years to generate 
late-onset disease models, and (ii) the onset age and severity of phenotypes can 
vary among individuals due to differences in genetic background. In the present
study, we established an efficient and rapid direct neuronal induction method
(induced neurons; iNs) from embryonic and adult marmoset fibroblasts to
investigate cellular-level phenotypes in the marmoset brain in vitro. We
overexpressed reprogramming effectors, i.e., microRNA-9/9*, microRNA-124, and
Achaete-Scute family bHLH transcription factor 1, in fibroblasts with a small
molecule cocktail that facilitates neuronal induction. The resultant iNs from
embryonic and adult marmoset fibroblasts showed neuronal characteristics within
two weeks, including neuron-specific gene expression and spontaneous neuronal
activity. As directly reprogrammed neurons have been shown to model
neurodegenerative disorders, the neuronal reprogramming of marmoset fibroblasts
may offer new tools for investigating neurological phenotypes associated with
disease progression in non-human primate neurological disease models.

We have observed in the basal forebrain of the common marmoset a group of
neurones which display tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity (THir) with three
different polyclonal antibodies and one monoclonal antibody, and which express TH
mRNA as shown by in situ hybridization histochemistry. The population of cells is
composed of large multipolar neurones and is located predominantly in the
substantia innominata and at the ventral, medial and lateral margins of the
external segment of the globus pallidus. The cell morphology and the distribution
of THir cells corresponds closely to the caudal portion of the nucleus basalis of
Meynert. Adjacent sections demonstrate both THir and choline acetyltransferase
immunoreactivity in the cells in this group, as well as strong
acetylcholinesterase activity but not dopamine immunoreactivity. These
observations indicate that many cholinergic neurones in the posterior nucleus
basalis of Meynert of the marmoset contain tyrosine hydroxylase, and suggest that
both acetylcholine and catecholamine may be synthesised as co-localised
neurotransmitters within the same magnocellular neurones. We observe no THir
cells in similar areas of the basal forebrain of either rhesus or talapoin
monkeys.

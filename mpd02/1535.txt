The extraoral presence of taste signal transduction proteins has recently been
reported in rodents and humans. Here, we report for the first time the presence
of these signal transduction proteins in the caecum of a non-human primate, the
common marmoset. Quantitative RT-PCR data on the gene expression of taste signal 
transduction molecules (gustducin and TRPM5) in common marmosets suggested high
expression in the caecum, which was not observed in other non-human primates.
Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed the specific presence of gustducin and
taste receptors in marmoset caecal cells. These results may relate to the
specific feeding behaviour of marmosets, which consume plant exudates, primarily 
gums.

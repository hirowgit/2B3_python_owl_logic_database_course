Obtaining a good prior for the linear pharmacokinetics of new monoclonal
antibodies (mAbs) would be an advantage not only for designing first-in-human
(FIH) studies but also for stabilizing fitting of data with non-linear
target-mediated disposition models. We estimated the pharmacokinetics from FIH
studies for five mAbs using a two-compartment model, both separately and
together, using a simple pool, a third hierarchical level of random effects for
between mAb differences and non-human-primate half-lives as a predictor covariate
for said differences. There was good agreement between compounds for the rapidly 
accessible central volume of 2.9 L (70 kg human), but clearances and peripheral
volumes differed with terminal half-lives ranging from 15 to 28 days. The simple 
pool of human studies gave inter-individual variability estimates of 32%
coefficient of variation (CV) for clearance and 33% CV for peripheral volume,
larger than for separate fits (13-26% CV and 15-35% CV for clearance and volume
respectively). Using third level hierarchical random effects gave
inter-individual variability estimates close to those of separate fits (24% and
16% CV respectively). The between-mAb differences became predictable if non-human
primate body weight scaled terminal half-life estimates were included as
covariates on clearance and peripheral volume. In conclusion, ignoring inter-mAb 
variation leads to inflated estimates of inter-individual variability and
unrealistic simulations for FIH studies. However, by using 70 kg body weight
scaled terminal half-life estimates from non-human primates one can account for
between-mAb differences and provide non-inflated priors for the linear
pharmacokinetic parameters of new mAbs.

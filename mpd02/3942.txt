2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx) and
2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) are amongst the most
abundant of the heterocyclic aromatic amines formed during the cooking of beef.
Both compounds are genotoxic and carcinogenic in rodents. These effects are
manifested only after activation of the amines by P450. Human liver is very
active at converting these amines to mutagenic products. Studies in vitro have
established that, for both amines, mutagenicity with human liver microsomes is
entirely via the N-hydroxylamine, essentially the only oxidation product of
either amine. Both N-hydroxylation and mutagenicity of the amines can be almost
completely inhibited by furafylline, a potent and highly selective inhibitor of
CYP1A2 in man. These data, together with the work of others, show that the
N-hydroxylation and hence the mutagenicity of both MeIQx and PhIP in man is
catalyzed almost exclusively by CYP1A2. Liver from cynomolgus monkeys, unlike
that from humans and marmosets, is very poor at activating MeIQx or PhIP to
mutagenic products. Studies with anti-peptide antibodies of defined specificity
revealed that this is due to the absence of CYP1A2, suggesting that this species 
should not be used to assess the possible risk posed to man by these amines. The 
marmoset would be a better species for this purpose.

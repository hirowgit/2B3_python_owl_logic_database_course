Evaluation of a pelleted diet in a colony of marmosets and tamarins.

Flurer C, Scheid R, Zucker H.

By offering various pelleted diet modifications to five species of
Callitrichidae, a palatable 24% protein diet was developed. The animals received 
limited fruit supplement, and families received an additional meal of commercial 
baby food. The pellets supplied approximately 75% of dietary energy and 95% of
total protein. In 15 months on this regimen, mortality dropped drastically and
fertility improved. No signs of a nutritional deficiency were observed. It was
concluded that the nutrient levels of this diet were adequate or above actual
requirements.

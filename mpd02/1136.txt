Rapamycin has been shown to extend lifespan in rodent models, but the effects on 
metabolic health and function have been widely debated in both clinical and
translational trials. Prior to rapamycin being used as a treatment to extend both
lifespan and healthspan in the human population, it is vital to assess the side
effects of the treatment on metabolic pathways in animal model systems, including
a closely related non-human primate model. In this study, we found that long-term
treatment of marmoset monkeys with orally-administered encapsulated rapamycin
resulted in no overall effects on body weight and only a small decrease in fat
mass over the first few months of treatment. Rapamycin treated subjects showed no
overall changes in daily activity counts, blood lipids, or significant changes in
glucose metabolism including oral glucose tolerance. Adipose tissue displayed no 
differences in gene expression of metabolic markers following treatment, while
liver tissue exhibited suppressed G6Pase activity with increased PCK and GPI
activity. Overall, the marmosets revealed only minor metabolic consequences of
chronic treatment with rapamycin and this adds to the growing body of literature 
that suggests that chronic and/or intermittent rapamycin treatment results in
improved health span and metabolic functioning. The marmosets offer an
interesting alternative animal model for future intervention testing and
translational modeling.

The typical diet of Callithrix marmosets is based on gums, although fungi are the
dietary staple of a single group of Callithrix flaviceps studied in the Augusto
Ruschi Biological Reserve, in southeastern Brazil. Here, we present the
nutritional composition of two species of Mycocitrus fungi consumed by C.
flaviceps, and discuss possible determinants of the preference of the marmosets
for fungi over gums. The fungi were high in sugar/fiber and poor in proteins, and
were similar in composition to the gums exploited by other marmosets and to the
fungi consumed by Callimico goeldii. The reduced protein content of the fungi may
be offset by the arthropod component of the diet of the Callithrix flaviceps
study group. The low relative metabolic rate and enlarged cecum of Callithrix
enable these marmosets to exploit foods with a high fiber content. In addition,
the greater digestibility of chitin in comparison with plant fiber may make fungi
a nutritionally more valuable resource to marmosets than gums. Marmosets, thus,
may prefer to feed on fungi when an adequate supply of this resource is available
in the environment.

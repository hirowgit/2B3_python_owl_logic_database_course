EBV has been associated with several malignancies in humans. EBV can also infect 
marmoset B lymphocytes, which, as opposed to human B cells, are permissive for
lytic Epstein-Barr viral replication. Mice with a severe combined
immunodeficiency phenotype (SCID mice) are extremely susceptible to EBV-induced
lymphomagenesis when inoculated with EBV-infected lymphocytes. We inoculated SCID
mice with human and marmoset lymphoblastoid cells infected with the same EBV
isolates. The marmoset cells never gave rise to lymphomas, even after the
administration of acyclovir or an anti-natural killer cell antibody and
observation periods of up to 16 wk. In contrast, the human lymphoblastoid cells
nearly always gave rise to lymphomas within 8 wk. Furthermore, human
lymphoblastoid cells genetically engineered to permit lytic EBV replication also 
readily formed tumors in the SCID mouse. Thus, in this system, it is the cellular
milieu that is crucial in determining whether a given lymphoblastoid cell will
give rise to a tumor, not the EBV isolate harbored by the cell or whether the
virus is permitted to undergo lytic replication.

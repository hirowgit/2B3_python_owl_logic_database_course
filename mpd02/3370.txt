We report on the diet and feeding behaviour of a group of Geoffroy's marmosets
(Callithrix geoffroyi) in an Atlantic forest fragment in south-eastern Brazil,
studied during the period February 1993 to Januaray 1994. Major food categories
were gums (68.6%) fruits (15%), and small animal prey (invertebrates 14.6% and
vertebrates 0.8%). Dietary changes were observed between the wet and dry seasons,
although they were not statistically significant. Insects and gums were consumed 
throughout the year but fruits were more prevalent in the diet in the wet season.
Plant species exploited for their gums includedInga stipularis, followed byAcacia
paniculata, Paulinia carpopodia, andBauhinia angulosa. Chemical analysis of the
gum of the four species most used all presented high values for carbohydrates and
crude proteins. Fruits of an unidentified species of Myrtaceae (sp. 2) were
consumed the most. Animal prey consisted mainly of insects, arachnids, snails,
and in three cases, lizards and frogs, with orthopterans being the most prevalent
insect prey. This study demonstrates thatC. geoffroyi efficiently exploits
resources typically available in secondary and disturbed forest habitat. The main
threat to the species is forest destruction, degradation, and fragmentation, but 
the management of small forest fragments may be an effective corservation
strategy.

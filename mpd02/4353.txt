In several species, including humans, suckling is known to suppress pulsatile
gonadotrophin secretion and substantially reduce fertility (1). During suckling
high titres of oxytocin are present in both plasma (2, 3) and cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF) (4) and there is some evidence that oxytocin is inhibitory to gonadotrophin
secretion by an action on t h e central nervous system, (5, 6). The common
marmoset, however, has a different physiological response and fails to show
lactational infertility; ovarian cyclicity is resumed immediately post-partum
(7). We have therefore examined the effect of centrally administered oxytocin on 
luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion in this species. We report that LH release was
stimulated with a rapid:esponse and in a dose-dependent manner by oxytocin
injected into t h e third cerebral ventricle. In contrast, oxytocin administered 
intravenously was without effect on LH secretion. These results clearly indicate,
for the first time, a stimulatory role for oxytocin in LH secretion in the
marmoset, a species which fails to demonstrate lactational infertility.

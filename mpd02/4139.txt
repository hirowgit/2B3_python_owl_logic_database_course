Samples of serum, feces and liver tissue and organs of six cotton-eared marmosets
Callithrix jacchus infected intravenously with two different strains of hepatitis
A virus (HAV), were studied by conventional histologic techniques, by serological
techniques and by immunocytochemical methods, such as immunofluorescence (IF) and
peroxidase-antibody techniques. Hepatitis A antigen (HAAg) was detectable in
daily collected stools, in liver biopsy obtained sequentially, and in organs
collected at necropsy. Two marmosets also developed antibodies to HAV. By
contrast, serum transaminases were not altered and there were histological
hepatic lesions consistent with acute viral hepatitis in all inoculated animals. 
The data obtained, demonstrate that these primates are susceptible to human HAV
and may be a useful animal model for the study of infection by this virus.

We previously reported that BMRF-2, an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) glycoprotein,
binds to beta1 family integrins and is important for EBV infection of polarized
oral epithelial cells. To further study the functions of BMRF-2, we constructed a
recombinant EBV that lacks BMRF-2 expression by homologous recombination in B95-8
cells. We found that lack of BMRF-2 resulted in about 50% reduction of EBV
attachment to oral epithelial cells, but not to B lymphocytes, suggesting that
BMRF-2 is critical for EBV infection in oral epithelial cells, but not in B
lymphocytes. In polarized oral epithelial cells, infection rate of the
recombinant EBV virus was about 4- to 8-fold lower than the wild-type B95-8
virus. Cell adhesion assays using the BMRF-2 RGD peptide and its RGE and AAA
mutants showed that the RGD motif is critical for BMRF-2 binding to integrins.
These data are consistent with our previous observation that interactions between
EBV BMRF-2 and integrins are critical for infection of oral epithelial cells with
EBV.

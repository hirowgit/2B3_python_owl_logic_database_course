Immunotoxic lesions of the diagonal band of Broca (VDB) in monkeys disrupted
cholinergic input to the hippocampus, producing impaired learning of visuospatial
conditional discriminations but not simple visual discriminations. Immunotoxic
lesions of the basal nucleus of Meynert (NBM) deprived the cortex of most of its 
cholinergic input, producing impaired learning of simple visual discriminations
but not visuospatial conditional discriminations. Combined lesions of the NBM +
VDB resulted in impaired learning of both types of task. The impairment after NBM
lesions ameliorated with time but could be reinstated by a low dose of the
glutamate blocking drug MK801, which, at this dose, did not impair simple visual 
discrimination learning in normal monkeys. The cholinergic projections from the
NBM and VDB may sustain the function of the glutamatergic pyramidal cell pathways
within the cortex and hippocampus, respectively.

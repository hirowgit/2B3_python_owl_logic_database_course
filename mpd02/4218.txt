The marmoset (Callithrix jacchus jacchus), a South American monkey, is
polymorphic for the middle- to long-wave cone photopigments: the three variant
pigments have spectral peaks at 543, 556 and 563 nm. Comparisons of the deduced
amino acid sequences of these pigments indicate that the variations in spectral
sensitivity are associated with the presence or absence of hydroxyl-bearing
residues at sites 180 and 285; but, in contrast to the additive hypothesis of
Neitz et al. (1991), we propose that adjustments at site 233 may also be required
to produce viable long-wave and middle-wave pigments. Within a family group of
monkeys, we find that a restriction site polymorphism in the photopigment gene
segregates in a way that is consistent with the single X-linked gene hypothesis
previously proposed on the basis of the photopigment types present in male and
female marmosets.

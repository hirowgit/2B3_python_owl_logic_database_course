Sequences of a 0.9-kb DNA segment spanning intron 11 of the von Willebrand Factor
gene (vWF) were determined for 21 individuals of 19 primate species. The results 
of maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood analyses of these vWF sequences are
congruent with previous molecular findings from other nonlinked nuclear genomic
loci which divide the platyrrhine superfamily Ceboidea into three monophyletic
families: Cebidae, Atelidae, and Pitheciidae. The vWF results strongly support
the taxon Callitrichinae as a monophyletic subfamily within Cebidae. The four
extant callitrichine genera constitute tribe Callitrichini, and the basal
branchings within this tribe first separate out Saguinus (tamarins), next
Leontopithecus (lion tamarins), and last the sister genera Callimico (Goeldi's
monkeys) and Callithrix (marmosets). Callithrix divides into three subclades,
with pygmy marmosets (C. pygmaea) as sister of the C. argentata species group and
with the C. jacchus species group as their sister. Fossil and DNA evidence place 
the emergence of the callitrichine clade in the basal cebid radiation at about 20
Ma (million years ago) and the three basal branchings in the callitrichin
radiation at about 13 to 11 Ma. In turn, the branchings separating the three
subclades of Callithrix are placed at about 5 to 4 Ma.

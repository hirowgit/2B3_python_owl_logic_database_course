A morphometric analysis of blood trypomastigotes identified as Trypanosoma
minasense, T. saimirii, and T. rangeli harbored by squirrel monkeys from the
Brazilian Amazon was performed. Additionally, morphological and biological
comparative analyses were conducted of T. saimirii-like and T. rangeli
development forms from haemoculture and xenodiagnosis. Illustrations are given of
blood trypomastigotes as well as of developing flagellates in triatomine and
axenic culture. Mean values of blood trypomastigotes of T. saimirii differ
statistically from those of T. rangeli in only two out of ten morphological
characters measured, and ranges overlapped. The developing forms of T.
saimrii-like parasites were essentially identical in both xenodiagnosis and
haemoculture to those of T. rangeli. Trypanosomes confirmed as T. rangeli were
transmitted to mice by the bites of the great majority of triatomines that fed on
T. saimirii-like infected monkeys. We conclude that, based on morphology and on
the development in triatomine bugs and haemoculture, T. saimirii should not be
considered a distinct species. We therefore propose T. saimirii to be a junior
synonym of T. rangeli.

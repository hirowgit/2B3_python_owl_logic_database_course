The optical performance of the eyes of nine vertebrate species was evaluated
using optical system design techniques and schematic eye models. Essential
features of eyes, including the modulation transfer function (MTF) and the MTF
cutoff frequency are related to the numerical aperture of the eyes. Superior
resolution for in vivo imaging of photoreceptors may be achieved by dilating the 
iris pupil of an eye, minimizing coherence, and using short wavelength
illumination. The difference of lateral and axial resolution between a small and 
a large eye for imaging photoreceptors in vivo.

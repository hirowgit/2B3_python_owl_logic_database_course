The S-isomer of the novel 5-HT3 receptor antagonist RS-42358
((S)-N-(1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-3-yl)-2,4,5,6-tetrahydro-1-H-
benzo[de]isoquinolin-1-one, RS-42358-197) disinhibited behaviour in the mouse
suppressed by the aversive situation of the light/dark test box. RS-42358-197 was
effective at sub-ng/kg dose levels and the efficacy was maintained over a 100
million-fold dose range. In contrast, the R-isomer was ineffective at all doses
studied. The S-isomer also disinhibited a suppressed behaviour in social
interaction and elevated X-maze tests in the rat and reduced anxiety-related
behaviours in a marmoset human threat test. RS-42358-197 prevented the
exacerbation of the suppression of behaviour in the mouse light/dark test
following withdrawal from treatment with alcohol, nicotine, cocaine and diazepam.
Thus, the S-isomer of RS-42358 has a consistent non-sedating anxiolytic profile
in rodent and primate models. It is exceptionally potent and a maintained
efficacy at high doses distinguishes its actions from many other 5-HT3 receptor
antagonists.

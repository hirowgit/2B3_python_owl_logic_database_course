A method for restraining the marmoset in a primate chair is described. The device
is inexpensive to construct, is reliable, and the majority of animals can be
habituated to its use. The chair has been used in neurobiological studies
employing electrophysiological recordings, with or without concurrent collection 
of serial blood samples.

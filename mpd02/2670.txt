The aim of this study was to identify the presence of Helicobacter sp. in the
gastric mucosa of captive marmosets (Callithrix sp.). Histologic specimens from
the fundic, corpus, and antral gastric regions of six Callithrix jacchus, 12 C.
kuhli, and 12 C. geoffroyi specimens were evaluated. The sections were stained
with hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) and the Warthin-Starry silver impregnation method,
and immunostained with rabbit anti-H. pylori polyclonal antibody.
Helicobacter-like organisms (HLOs) and coccoid forms were present in
silver-stained sections from 29 stomachs, whereas immunohistochemistry (IHC)
tests revealed bacterial aggregates in 15 stomachs. No statistical difference
relative to the presence of Helicobacter sp. was found among the gastric regions 
or marmoset species. Gastric lesions were found in the groups of marmosets that
had positive and negative IHC results, but no correlation between inflammation
and Helicobacter sp. infection was established. These findings demonstrate that
marmosets are susceptible to naturally-occurring Helicobacter sp. infection, and 
open the way to the development of comparative studies on Helicobacter sp.
infection in humans.

The vocalisations of wild common marmosets, Callithrix jacchus, were recorded to 
investigate whether call rate by individuals is affected by time of day, age, sex
or dominance rank within a group. We also investigated how vocalisation pitch was
affected by age, focussing on a single common call, the trill call. Adults
vocalised more than juveniles or infants during the majority of daylight hours.
Only the call rate of juveniles varied significantly over the day. No differences
were found between either sex or dominance rank with respect to rate of
vocalisations. The trill calls emitted by young wild common marmosets were of a
higher pitch than those emitted by adults. We conclude that the auditory
communication of wild common marmosets is related to the age of the animals, both
in terms of call rate and the physical characteristics of their vocalisations.

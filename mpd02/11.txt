A previous study assessing the efficiency of the genome editing technology
CRISPR-Cas9 for knock-in gene targeting in common marmoset (marmoset; Callithrix 
jacchus) embryonic stem cells (ESCs) unexpectedly identified innately enhanced
homologous recombination activity in marmoset ESCs. Here, we compared gene
expression in marmoset and human pluripotent stem cells using transcriptomic and 
quantitative PCR analyses and found that five HR-related genes (BRCA1, BRCA2,
RAD51C, RAD51D, and RAD51) were upregulated in marmoset cells. A total of four of
these upregulated genes enhanced HR efficiency with CRISPR-Cas9 in human
pluripotent stem cells. Thus, the present study provides a novel insight into
species-specific mechanisms for the choice of DNA repair pathways.

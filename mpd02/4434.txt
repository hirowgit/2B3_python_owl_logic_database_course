1. The possible relationship between the fatty acid composition of the adipose
tissue of the marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus) and its dietary lipid intake
was examined after a long-term feeding trial. 2. Only the proportions of stearic 
and linoleic acid in the adipose tissue were similar to those in the diet. The
proportions of all other saturated and unsaturated fatty acid components were
significantly different thus greatly reducing the potential value of this
relationship in the marmoset. 3. The phospholipid fatty acid profiles of cardiac 
and skeletal muscle, aortae, kidney, liver, lung and brain were also compared to 
those of the plasma, platelets or red blood cells. 4. With the exception of the
liver where the fatty acid profile is similar to that of the plasma, no clear
relationships were found between the fatty acid profiles of these tissues and the
components of the blood. 5. The fatty acid composition of skeletal muscle was
very similar to that of the cardiac muscle of the marmoset, suggesting that
muscle biopsy might be useful as an index of cardiac muscle composition.

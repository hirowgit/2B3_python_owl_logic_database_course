Using the technique of intrinsic signal optical imaging, orientation preference
maps were obtained from the Wulst of the barn owl in the area that represents
central vision, and from the visual cortices (V1 and V2) of cat and marmoset
monkey. Iso-orientation domains in barn owl's visual Wulst were patch-like
structures with an inter-patch distance of approximately 0.9 mm, arranged in a
pinwheel-like manner around singularity points. The size of the iso-orientation
domains in barn owl was larger than those found in area V1, but comparable to
those found in area V2, of cat and monkey. Superficial layers of the owl visual
Wulst may be equivalent to extra-striate visual areas of primates and carnivores,
as already suggested by electrophysiologists discussing the much increased radial
dimensions of the Wulst compared with neocortex in mammals.

This article reviews a long-term investigation into the roles of (1) experience
obtained with infants during development and postnatally, and (2) levels of
reproductive-steroid hormones during late pregnancy, in the regulation of
maternal caregiving motivation and behaviour in the red-bellied tamarin (Saguinus
labiatus) and the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) (family Callitrichidae,
Order Primates). Both observational studies, e.g. post hoc analysis of the
relationship between developmental caregiving experience and infant-rearing
success, and manipulative studies, e.g. direct analysis of the effects of
sex-steroid administration on maternal motivation, were performed. In red-bellied
tamarins, a breeding female's infant-rearing success was related to its
caregiving experience obtained during development and postpartum/postnatally. In 
multiparous females lacking developmental caregiving experience, postpartum
maternal caregiving behaviour and infant-rearing success were related to
prepartum urinary oestradiol levels. In nulliparous common marmosets, caregiving 
of infant-siblings increased as a consequence of physical interaction with
parent-infant dyads, late pregnancy, and exposure to late pregnancy-like levels
of progesterone and oestradiol. The evidence for a dual mechanism of endocrine
and experiential regulation of caregiving in these monkeys is discussed in terms 
its evolution and function.

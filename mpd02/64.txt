Positron emission tomography (PET) allows biomolecular tracking but PET
monitoring of brain networks has been hampered by a lack of suitable reporters.
Here, we take advantage of bacterial dihydrofolate reductase, ecDHFR, and its
unique antagonist, TMP, to facilitate in vivo imaging in the brain. Peripheral
administration of radiofluorinated and fluorescent TMP analogs enabled PET and
intravital microscopy, respectively, of neuronal ecDHFR expression in mice. This 
technique can be used to the visualize neuronal circuit activity elicited by
chemogenetic manipulation in the mouse hippocampus. Notably, ecDHFR-PET allows
mapping of neuronal projections in non-human primate brains, demonstrating the
applicability of ecDHFR-based tracking technologies for network monitoring.
Finally, we demonstrate the utility of TMP analogs for PET studies of turnover
and self-assembly of proteins tagged with ecDHFR mutants. These results establish
opportunities for a broad spectrum of previously unattainable PET analyses of
mammalian brain circuits at the molecular level.

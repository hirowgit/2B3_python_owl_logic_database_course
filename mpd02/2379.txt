Glycoprotein gH, together with its chaperone gL and a third glycoprotein gB, is
essential for cell-cell fusion and virus-cell fusion mediated by herpesviruses.
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), the prototype human lymphocryptovirus, requires a
fourth glycoprotein gp42 to support fusion with B cells in addition to epithelial
cells. Two other lymphocryptoviruses, the rhesus lymphocryptovirus (Rh-LCV) and
the common marmoset lymphocryptovirus (CalHV3), have been sequenced in their
entirety and each has a gp42 homologue. Combinations of proteins from EBV, Rh-LCV
and CalHV3 were able to mediate fusion of epithelial cells, but, even when
complexed with EBV gp42, only Rh-LCV and not CalHV3 proteins were able to mediate
fusion with human B cells. CalHV3 gL was also unable to function effectively as a
chaperone for EBV or Rh-LCV gH. The Rh-LCV gH homologue supported more fusion
than EBV gH with an epithelial cell and supported the highest levels of fusion
with a B cell. Chimeric constructs made from Rh-LCV gH and EBV gH that have 85.4 
% sequence identity should prove useful for mapping the regions of gH that are of
importance to fusion as a whole and to B-cell fusion in particular.

The structure of the vomeronasal organ and nasopalatine ducts in Aotus
trivirgatus and some other primate species.

Hunter AJ, Fleming D, Dixson AF.

A vomeronasal organ and patent nasopalatine ducts were found in adult specimens
of Aotus trivirgatus, Arctocebus calabarensis, Ateles geoffroyi and Saguinus
fuscicollis. The vomeronasal complex appeared to be functional except in Ateles. 
However, the relative size of the organ in the Platyrrhini is much reduced
compared to that in prosimians. The possible role of the organ in mediating
neuroendocrine processes in primates is discussed.

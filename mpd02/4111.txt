This investigation aimed to identify the behaviour of primate mandibular condylar
cartilage cells in an in vitro model. Cells were harvested from the mandibular
condyles of 1-year-old marmosets and maintained in primary culture for up to 30
d. Cell proliferation, structure, and phenotype were assessed at regular
intervals by phase-contrast microscopy, cytologic staining, and
immunocytochemistry. Cell growth increased progressively, and cultures reached
confluence after 22 d. Cells were initially small and round but later became
enlarged and heterogeneous in shape. Polygonal and hypertrophic chondroblast-like
cells dominated the mature cultures. Glycosaminoglycan synthesis increased as
cultures aged. Type I collagen was produced by early cultures, whereas type II
collagen predominated in mature confluent monolayers. It is suggested that this
mixed population of cells underwent phenotypic changes in primary cell culture
that closely resemble the normal in vivo maturation process.

CTLs recognize 8- to 10-mer peptides on MHC class I molecules. Recent studies
have shown that human CTLs kill autologous tumor cells in an HLA-restricted and
peptide-specific manner, and that artificial pep- tides can stimulate
tumor-specific CTLs both in vitro and in vivo. Accordingly, several human
clinical trials using such peptides are ongoing worldwide. In such methods, the
amount of peptide-MHC complexes that remain on the cell surface of APCs after
peptide administration is crucial, because CTL activation depends on the number
of ligated TCRs and co-stimulation. However, it remains uncertain how many
peptide-MHC complexes are reconstituted and remain on live cells after peptide
administration. We herein examined the binding affinities of five HLA-A*0201
restricted peptides-four TAAs and one HIV antigen-to HLA-A*0201 molecules and
their decay rates on a live B cell line using tandem mass spectrometry. Our
experiments showed that nearly 10(5) peptide-MHC complexes per cell could be
reconstituted on a cell surface by pulsing a high dose of peptide even if the
binding affinities were intermediate or low. However, the decay rates observed
for these pep- tide-MHC complexes on a B cell line were faster than previously
estimated.

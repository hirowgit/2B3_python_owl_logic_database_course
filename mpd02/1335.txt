The following is a report on a congenital vaginal malformation, imperforate
vagina, in the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). This anomaly was observed
for the first time in an adult female in our research colony. There was no
uterine and vaginal aplasia or atresia in her grossly normal genital tract. The
plasma progesterone concentration suggested that the ovarian cycle had ceased.
However, this may not be related to a functional anomaly, but rather to
suppressed ovulation resulting from subordination to cagemates considering the
various stages of follicular development observed.

In order to directly demonstrate the roles of CD8(+) T lymphocytes in non-human
primates, in vivo depletion of the CD8(+) T cells by administration of a
CD8-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) is one of the crucial techniques.
Recently, the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), which is classified as a New 
World monkey, has been shown useful as an experimental animal model for various
human diseases such as multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease and a number of
infectious diseases. Here we show that an anti-marmoset CD8 mAb 6F10, which we
have recently established, efficiently depletes the marmoset CD8(+) T lymphocytes
in vivo, i.e., the administration of 6F10 induces drastic and specific reduction 
in the ratio of the CD8(+) T cell subset for at least three weeks or longer. Our 
finding will help understand the pivotal role of CD8(+) T cells in vivo in the
control of human diseases.

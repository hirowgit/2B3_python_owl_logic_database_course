Most descriptions of callitrichid antipredator behavior have come from
observations of visual encounters with predators, but there is also anecdotal
evidence suggesting that callitrichids may use auditory cues associated with
raptors for the early detection of potential danger. In the present study,
Geoffroy's marmosets consistently reacted to the tape-recorded calls of a
red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis) with high-intensity antipredator behaviors.
Compared to the taped calls of a raven (Corvus corax) and the taped sound of a
power drill, the hawk calls elicited more startle reactions, more alarm calls,
longer freeze times, increased use of safe areas of their enclosure and greater
disruption in ongoing behavior. Once in a relatively safe location in the
enclosure, the marmosets visually monitored the site of origin of the calls for
10 min and minimized locomotion for 30 min, but resumed baseline levels of other 
activities that had been disrupted by the hawk calls. Marmosets may use the
auditory cues associated with predators for early detection, and subsequent
avoidance, of a potential predator in the vicinity.

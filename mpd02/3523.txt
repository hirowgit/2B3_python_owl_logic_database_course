We have investigated the role of sensory nerves in regulating airway smooth
muscle function in the guinea-pig, marmoset, rabbit and man. Tissue levels of the
sensory neuropeptides CGRP and substance P in the airways of the guinea-pig were 
significantly greater compared with the rabbit and marmoset. The relative order
of tissue content was guinea-pig >>> rabbit = marmoset. Marmoset bronchial and
tracheal preparations responded weakly to exogenously administered substance P
and neurokinin A but contracted to methacholine and demonstrated
atropine-sensitive cholinergic responses. In marmoset, rabbit and human airway
preparations, capsaicin mediated weak contractile responses to exogenously
administered capsaicin. However, high concentrations of capsaicin elicited a
relaxation response that was epithelium-independent, cyclo-oxygenase-insensitive,
not involving nitric oxide and not dependent on the activation of
capsaicin-sensitive afferents. These results suggest that rabbit and marmoset
airways respond functionally in a similar way to human airway preparations and
maybe more relevant than guinea-pig airways with regard to understanding the role
of sensory neuropeptides in airways.

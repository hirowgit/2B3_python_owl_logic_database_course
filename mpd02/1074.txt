Common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) are an important NHP model for the study of
human aging and age-related diseases. However, the full potential of marmosets as
a research model has not been realized due to a lack of evidence-based,
standardized procedures for their captive management, especially regarding diet
and feeding husbandry. In the present study, we conducted a high-resolution
metabolomics analysis of plasma from marmosets from a 3-mo dietary crossover
study to determine whether significant metabolic differences occur with a
semisynthetic chemically defined (purified) diet as needed for controlled
nutrition research. Marmosets were fed a standard, diverse-ingredient diet,
followed by a semisynthetic purified diet, and then were switched back to the
standard diet. The standard diet used in this analysis was specific to the animal
facility, but it is similar in content to the diets currently used for other
marmoset colonies. High-resolution metabolomics of plasma with liquid
chromatography-mass spectrometry and bioinformatics was used to measure metabolic
differences. The concentration of the essential amino acids methionine,
leucine/isoleucine, lysine, and threonine were higher when marmosets were fed the
purified diet. In contrast, phenylalanine concentrations were higher during
exposure to the standard diet. In addition, metabolic pathway enrichment and
analysis revealed differences among metabolites associated with dopamine
metabolism and the carnitine shuttle. These results show that diet-associated
differences in metabolism occur in marmosets and suggest that additional
nutritional studies with detailed physiologic characterization are needed to
optimize standard and purified diets for common marmosets.

The development of the earliest vocalizations of human infants is influenced by
social feedback from caregivers. As these vocalizations change, they increasingly
elicit such feedback. This pattern of development is in stark contrast to that of
our close phylogenetic relatives, Old World monkeys and apes, who produce
mature-sounding vocalizations at birth. We put forth a scenario to account for
this difference: Humans have a cooperative breeding strategy, which pressures
infants to compete for the attention from caregivers. Humans use this strategy
because large brained human infants are energetically costly and born altricial. 
An altricial brain accommodates vocal learning. To test this hypothetical
scenario, we present findings from New World marmoset monkeys indicating that,
through convergent evolution, this species adopted a largely identical
developmental system-one that includes vocal learning and cooperative breeding.

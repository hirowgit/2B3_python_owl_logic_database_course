Tau is a microtubule-associated protein expressed in neuronal axons.
Hyperphosphorylated tau is a major component of neurofibrillary tangles, a
pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Hyperphosphorylated tau
aggregates are also found in many neurodegenerative diseases, collectively
referred to as "tauopathies," and tau mutations are associated with familial
frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Previous studies have generated
transgenic mice with mutant tau as tauopathy models, but nonhuman primates, which
are more similar to humans, may be a better model to study tauopathies. For
example, the common marmoset is poised as a nonhuman primate model for
investigating the etiology of age-related neurodegenerative diseases. However, no
biochemical studies of tau have been conducted in marmoset brains. Here, we
investigated several important aspects of tau, including expression of different 
tau isoforms and its phosphorylation status, in the marmoset brain. We found that
marmoset tau does not possess the "primate-unique motif" in its N-terminal
domain. We also discovered that the tau isoform expression pattern in marmosets
is more similar to that of mice than that of humans, with adult marmoset brains
expressing only four-repeat tau isoforms as in adult mice but unlike in adult
human brains. Of note, tau in brains of marmoset newborns was phosphorylated at
several sites associated with AD pathology. However, in adult marmoset brains,
much of this phosphorylation was lost, except for Ser-202 and Ser-404
phosphorylation. These results reveal key features of tau expression and
phosphorylation in the marmoset brain, a potentially useful nonhuman primate
model of neurodegenerative diseases.

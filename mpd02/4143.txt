Mortality statistics from five populations of small New World monkeys (includinsg
Callithrix jaccus, Leontopithecus rosalia, Saguinus fuscicollis, and Saguinus
oedipus) were combined to generate a standard model life table reflecting the
mortality patterns of these primates. The model is applied to three individual
populations to illustrate a strategy for smoothing and interpolating mortality
statistics of varying completeness and quality. © 1993 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

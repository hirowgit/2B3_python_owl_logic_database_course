A novel calcimimetic agent, evocalcet (MT-4580/KHK7580), suppresses the
parathyroid cell function with little effect on the gastrointestinal tract or CYP
isozymes in vivo and in vitro.

Cinacalcet hydrochloride (cinacalcet), an oral calcimimetic agent has been widely
used for the management of secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) in chronic kidney
disease (CKD). In sharp contrast to vitamin D receptor activators, cinacalcet
suppresses SHPT without inducing hypercalcemia or hyperphosphatemia.
Nevertheless, some patients remain refractory to SHPT with this agent, as the
dose cannot be sufficiently increased due to gastrointestinal symptoms. In order 
to resolve this issue, we have developed a newly synthesized calcimimetic agent, 
evocalcet (MT-4580/KHK7580). In a rat model of CKD induced by 5/6 nephrectomy,
oral administration of evocalcet efficiently suppressed the secretion of
parathyroid hormone (PTH). With regard to the gastro-intestinal effects,
cinacalcet induced a significant delay in gastric emptying in rats, while
evocalcet did no marked effects on it. Evocalcet also demonstrated the less
induction of emesis compared to cinacalcet in common marmosets. The
pharmacological effects of evocalcet were observed at lower doses because of its 
higher bioavailability than cinacalcet, which may have contributed to the reduced
GI tract symptoms. In addition, evocalcet showed no substantial direct inhibition
of any CYP isozymes in in vitro liver microsome assay, suggesting a better
profile in drug interactions than cinacalcet that inhibits cytochrome P450 (CYP) 
2D6. These findings suggest that evocalcet can be a better alternative to
cinacalcet, an oral calcimimetic agent, with a wider safety margin.

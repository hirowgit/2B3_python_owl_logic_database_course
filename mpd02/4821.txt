A stereotaxic x-ray map of the hypothalamus of the marmoset monkey Callithrix
jacchus.

Lipp HP.

Precise hypothalamic surgery in the marmoset monkey Callithrix jacchus cannot be 
performed by means of the Horsley-Clarke stereotaxic procedure. Thus, a simple
stereotaxic X-ray technique was developed. Technical requirements are a
stereotaxic frame for small animals and a dental X-ray source. A sagittal map
shows hypothalamic structures in relation to surrounding bony landmarks.
Corresponding coronal plates allow target determination in that plane.
Intracerebral coordinates based on the position of the optic chiasma can be
transformed into individual Horsley-Clarke coordinates. The error of the atlas is
estimated as +/- 0.25 mm anteroposteriorly, +/- 0.1 mm coronally, and +/- 0.5 mm 
vertically.

BACKGROUND: A survey was developed to characterize disease incidence, common
pathology lesions, environmental characteristics, and nutrition programs within
captive research marmoset colonies.
METHODS: Seventeen research facilities completed the electronic survey.
RESULTS: Nutritional management programs varied amongst research institutions
housing marmosets; eight primary base diets were reported. The most common
clinical syndromes reported were gastrointestinal disease (i.e. inflammatory
bowel disease like disease, chronic lymphocytic enteritis, chronic malabsorption,
chronic diarrhea), metabolic bone disease or fracture, infectious diarrhea, and
oral disease (tooth root abscesses, gingivitis, tooth root resorption). The five 
most common pathology morphologic diagnoses were colitis, nephropathy/nephritis, 
enteritis, chronic lymphoplasmacytic enteritis, and cholecystitis. Obesity was
more common (average 20% of a reporting institution's population) than thin body 
condition (average 5%).
CONCLUSIONS: Through review of current practices, we aim to inspire development
of evidence-based practices to standardize husbandry and nutrition practices for 
marmoset research colonies.

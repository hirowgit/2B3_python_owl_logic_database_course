Pygmy marmosets are distinctive given their diminutive body size, their
year-round reliance upon exudates, and their use of morphologically adapted
tegulae to engage in a high degree of claw-clinging behaviors associated with
exudate exploitation. This project examined the positional behavior and habitat
preferences of one group of pygmy marmosets in a secondary forest within the
Department of Pando, northwestern Bolivia. Results from this study indicate that 
pygmy marmosets primarily use claw-clinging during feeding (89.6%) with
preferential use of large vertical trunks. Claw-clinging was also the dominant
postural mode during exudate foraging (43.1%) with preferential use of large
vertical trunks. Quadrupedalism was the dominant locomotor mode during travel
(55.7%) with preferential use of bamboo and medium-sized substrates. These
results support previous notions that claw-climbing is a solution to overcome the
constraints of small body size while suggesting that quadrupedalism is a
habitat-dependent locomotor mode.

The expression of several adhesion surface receptors was studied on cells of
early limb bud development of 58 Wistar rats treated orally with two daily doses 
of the thalidomide derivative EM12 (2 x 50 mg/kg body weight) from day 7 to 10 of
pregnancy. EM12 is a more potent teratogen than thalidomide. Limb bud cells of 56
untreated animals served as controls. The studies revealed that the integrins
CD11a, CD11b, CD18, CD49d, and CD61, as well as the additional adhesion receptors
CD54, CD62L, and the transferrin receptor CD71 were expressed on day 11 of
gestation to various degrees on these embryonic cells. In contrast to results of 
previous studies with a non-human primate (Callithrix jacchus) there was no
down-regulation of any of these receptors on the surface of limb bud cells of the
rat embryos after treatment with EM12. This result is in accordance with the lack
of teratogenicity in this rodent species.

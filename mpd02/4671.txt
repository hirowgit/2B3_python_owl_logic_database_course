Canine tooth root infection as a cause of facial abscess in the common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus).

Baskerville M.

Facial abscesses in a colony of common marmosets were found to be caused by
abscessation of an upper canine tooth root. Trauma to the upper canine, resulting
in exposure of the pulp cavity, was thought to be the mode of infection.
Radiography was the most useful diagnostic aid in establishing the nature and
extent of the lesion. Antibiotic therapy alone was inadequate, and provision of
drainage by extracting the tooth, in conjunction with antibiotics, proved the
most effective treatment.

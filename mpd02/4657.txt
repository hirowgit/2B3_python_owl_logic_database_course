Selective focal inhibition of brain protein synthesis during generalized
bicuculline seizures in newborn marmoset monkeys.

Dwyer BE, Wasterlain CG.

Generalized epileptic seizures, induced in 5-7 day-old marmoset monkeys with
bicuculline (5 mg/kg) produce striking focal disruption of protein synthesis.
Inhibition of protein synthesis was most severe in the neocortex and hippocampus 
but was completely absent in the lateral geniculate nuclei and in the optic
tract. In the cortex, regions in which protein synthesis was most severely
reduced alternated with areas in which it was relatively preserved creating a
columnar pattern. With few exceptions, subcortical gray matter structures in the 
forebrain and brainstem were less severely affected than the cortex. In the
cerebellum, seizures appeared to have little effect on the proliferating external
granular layer while the closely adjacent internal granular layer showed
clear-cut inhibition. The focal nature of protein synthesis inhibition in brain
during seizures suggests that the systemic effects of convulsions (e.g.
hypoxemia, acidosis or changes in arterial blood pressure) are not a major
factor. More likely, protein synthesis inhibition is related to the extent to
which various cerebral structures participate in seizure activity.

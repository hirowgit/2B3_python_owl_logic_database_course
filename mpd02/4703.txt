Presence of pH2-sensitive circulating interferon among Callithrix jacchus
marmosets.

Significant and relatively stable levels of serum-interferon were demonstrated in
a Callithrix jacchus population. This circulating interferon was acid-sensitive
in all cases, classifying it as immune or "gamma-type" interferon. Our results in
these hematopoietic chimeras suggest that the presence of immune-type or at least
pH 2-sensitive interferon could be related to the presence of two allogenic
lymphocyte populations in each marmoset.

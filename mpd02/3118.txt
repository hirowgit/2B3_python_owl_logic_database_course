Marmoset monkeys with excitotoxic lesions confined to cornu ammonis subfields
1-3, subiculum and pre-subiculum, but sparing the entorhinal cortex, were
impaired on retention and learning of conditional object-choice discriminations. 
For each of these discriminations, the monkeys were required to choose one of two
objects depending on which of two patterned backgrounds was used on each trial.
Two styles of order of trial presentation were used: 'random' presentation which 
maximised the degree of interference between trials, and 'runs' presentation
which was intended to encourage the monkeys to learn each component of the
discrimination separately. Before surgery monkeys found the discriminations more 
difficult to learn when the trials were presented in the 'runs' style than when
presented in the 'random' style suggesting that the task is best learnt by
applying a conditional rule. After surgery a significant 'group x style'
interaction indicated that the 'runs' style was especially difficult for the
lesioned monkeys. From these results we suggest that the hippocampus is involved 
in learning about and remembering non-spatial, conditional relations between
objects.

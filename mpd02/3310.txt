Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in outbred marmoset monkeys
(Callithrix jacchus) is a recently developed nonhuman primate model of multiple
sclerosis. Here, Bert 't Hart and colleagues compare this model to EAE in rhesus 
monkeys, highlighting autoimmune mechanisms in CNS inflammation and
demyelination, including the role of major histocompatibility complex restriction
and preclinical evaluation of innovative immunotherapies.

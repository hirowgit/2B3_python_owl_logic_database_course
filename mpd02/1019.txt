BACKGROUND: This study determined the pharmacokinetics of the contrast agent
gadobutrol in marmosets by quantitative MRI to derive guidelines for neuroimaging
protocols.
METHODS: Local concentrations of gadobutrol were determined from consecutive
gradient echo-based mapping of the relaxation rate R1 on a clinical 3T MRI
scanner. Half-time of renal elimination was measured after injection of a triple 
dose of gadobutrol (0.3 mmol/kg) into the saphenous vein. A first-order
single-compartment model was fitted to the measured R1 values and verified by
blood analysis.
RESULTS: Slow injection (1.5 minutes) resulted in an elimination half-time of
26±4 minutes. After bolus injection (15 seconds), elimination was much slower
(62±8 minutes) with 45% larger distribution volumes. Importantly, more gadobutrol
entered the cerebrospinal fluid.
CONCLUSIONS: Slow injection and a latency of about 20 minutes are recommended to 
avoid extravasation. Application of a triple dose of gadobutrol compensates for
the fast elimination in healthy marmosets.

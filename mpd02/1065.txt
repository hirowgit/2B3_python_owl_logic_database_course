BACKGROUND: Basal thermal values of captive adult black tufted-ear marmosets
(Callithrix penicillata) in a thermoneutral environment were measured via
different methods, along with body weight and hematological parameters.
METHOD: Body temperatures were recorded with rectal (RC), subcutaneous (SC)
microchip transponder and infrared (left and right) tympanic membrane (TM)
thermometries. Thermal values were correlated with body mass and some
hematological data.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Similar RC and SC temperatures were observed, these
being significantly higher than the left and right TM values. SC temperature was 
positively correlated and in close agreement with RC measurements. Although body 
temperatures were not influenced by gender, capture time, or body weight, they
were correlated with hematological parameters. Thus, body temperatures in this
species seem to reflect some of the characteristics of the assessments' location,
with SC microchip transponders being a less invasive method to assess body
temperature in these small-bodied non-human primates.

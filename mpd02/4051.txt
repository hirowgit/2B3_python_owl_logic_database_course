Marmosets injected intrahepatically with nucleic acids (cDNA and RNA transcripts)
representing the full-length genome of the wild-type HM-175 strain of hepatitis A
virus experienced acute hepatitis and seroconversion to hepatitis A virus capsid 
proteins. The hepatitis was comparable in severity to that caused by infection
with the wild-type virus. The viral cDNA and the hepatitis A virus recovered from
the feces of an injected animal contained the same marker mutation. Therefore,
intermediate cell culture steps can be omitted and the virulence of a hepatitis A
virus encoded by a cDNA clone can be evaluated by direct transfection of
marmosets.

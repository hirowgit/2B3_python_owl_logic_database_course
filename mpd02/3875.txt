The allometric relationship between the weight of the heart and the body
measurements was analyzed in 31 primates of genus Callithrix (C. jacchus and C.
penicillata). The data were analyzed after logarithmic transformation using the
model: Ln Y = Ln a + (b) Ln X. We compared with the t-test the slopes of the
males and females and the slopes of the C. Jacchus and C. penicillata. Positive
allometry was found to the weight of the heart in relation to the body weight
(except to females of C. penicillata = isometry) and to sitting height in females
of C. jacchus and males of C. penicillata. The relationship of the weight of the 
heart with the sitting height was isometric in males of C. jacchus and negative
in females of C. penicillata. We cannot reject the null hypothesis analyzing the 
differences between the slopes of males and females. Therefore, in these two
species of Callithrix we accept the concept of monomorphism.

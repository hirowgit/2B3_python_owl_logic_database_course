Current dopamine replacement therapies, in Parkinson's disease (PD), result in
aversive side effects and rapid drug dose escalation over time. Therefore, a
non-dopaminergic treatment would be an advantageous supplement to lower the dose 
of dopamine replacement treatment postponing the occurrence of side effects. The 
noradrenergic system plays an important role in the facilitation or maintenance
of the activity of the nigrostriatal dopamine pathways. Here the putative
anti-Parkinson effects of the oral selective alpha2C-adrenoceptor antagonist
(JNJ27063699 0.1-10mg/kg p.o.) and of vehicle (fruit syrup) were evaluated in the
MPTP-marmoset model. Dose-related anti-Parkinson effects were assessed by means
of a behavioural rating scale covering parkinsonian symptoms, body weight and
body temperature, and two test systems assessing locomotor activity and complex
motor skills of hand-eye coordination for controlled movements in MPTP- or
saline-pretreated marmosets. JNJ27063699, at the middle and higher doses,
consistently improved locomotor activity and hand-eye coordination capabilities, 
which indicates an improvement in the coordination of motor control -or
movements- in MPTP-pretreated monkeys. No additional effects on the parkinsonian 
symptoms or side effects were observed on other test systems. Overall, the
findings link deficit in motor coordination with dysfunctional adrenergic
signalling and it suggest that selective alpha2C adrenergic antagonism may
contribute to behavioural improvement in the MPTP-monkey model of PD. In
multi-drug medication JNJ27063699 might have potential in the treatment of motor 
deficit in PD.

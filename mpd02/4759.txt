Organophosphate poisoning in marmosets.

Brack M, Rothe H.

Due to faulty use of a chlorpyriphos-diazinon combination as a pesticide within a
laboratory animal house, 19 marmosets of 2 species (Saguinus fuscicollis and
Callithrix jacchus) of 98 at risk died from organophosphorous poisoning (19%)
mortality). The clinical signs were those of cholinesterase inhibitors. The
morphological lesions consisted predominantly of haemorrhages in several organs, 
particularly the CNS, and of bone marrow necroses.

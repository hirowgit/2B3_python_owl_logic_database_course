The marmoset is an emerging animal model for large-scale attempts to understand
primate brain connectivity, but achieving this aim requires the development and
validation of procedures for normalization and integration of results from many
neuroanatomical experiments. Here we describe a computational pipeline for
coregistration of retrograde tracing data on connections of cortical areas into a
3D marmoset brain template, generated from Nissl-stained sections. The procedure 
results in a series of spatial transformations that are applied to the
coordinates of labeled neurons in the different cases, bringing them into common 
stereotaxic space. We applied this procedure to 17 injections, placed in the
frontal lobe of nine marmosets as part of earlier studies. Visualizations of
cortical patterns of connections revealed by these injections are supplied as
Supplementary Materials. Comparison between the results of the automated and
human-based processing of these cases reveals that the centers of injection sites
can be reconstructed, on average, to within 0.6 mm of coordinates estimated by an
experienced neuroanatomist. Moreover, cell counts obtained in different areas by 
the automated approach are highly correlated (r = 0.83) with those obtained by an
expert, who examined in detail histological sections for each individual. The
present procedure enables comparison and visualization of large datasets, which
in turn opens the way for integration and analysis of results from many animals. 
Its versatility, including applicability to archival materials, may reduce the
number of additional experiments required to produce the first detailed cortical 
connectome of a primate brain. J. Comp. Neurol. 524:2161-2181, 2016. © 2016 The

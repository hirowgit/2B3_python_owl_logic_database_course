This paper deals with the transferrin (Tf) polymorphism in the South American
marmoset Callithrix jacchus. The transferrin bands of this species are positioned
in the electropherogramme cathodal to the beta1C-globulin (C 3), s. Fig. 1. By
means of the combined agarose gel immuno-electrophoresis 7 distinguishable
phenotypes have been detected in 166 animals (s. Fig. 2). The formal genetic
analysis of 28 matings with 48 youngs (cf. Table 1) leads to the assumption that 
at least 4 codominant alleles (Tf Cja, Tf Cjb, Tf Cjc, Tf Cjd) are existent at
the autosomal Tf-locus in Callithrix jacchus.

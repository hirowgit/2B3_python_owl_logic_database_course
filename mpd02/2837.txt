Little information is available on the lipid changes caused by Schistosoma
mansoni reinfection. In this work it was evaluated alteration in the plasma
lipids due to one reinfection by Schistosoma mansoni in the non human primate
Callithrix jacchus (sagüi). Blood samples from C. jacchus, prior and after 60
days infection and reinfection, were collected by intravenous puncture,
anticoagulated with EDTA (1mg/mL) and centrifuged at 2,500 xg, in order to obtain
the plasma. Total cholesterol, cholesteryl ester, total phospholipid and
triglyceride levels were determined by spectrophotometer methods. The results
showed that there are significant reduction in cholesterol total, cholesteryl
ester, total phospholipid and triglyceride concentrations in plasma of animals
reinfected by Schistosoma mansoni, in comparison to the same animals prior and
after one infection. This study showed that a second infection of Callithrix
jacchus by Schistosoma mansoni causes plasma lipid alterations, which are more
significant than after a single infection.

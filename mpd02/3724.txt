The morphology and distribution of horizontal cells was studied in the retina of 
a New World monkey, the marmoset, Callithrix jacchus, and compared with that of
the Old World macaque monkey. Horizontal cells in macaque and marmoset were
either labelled with the carbocyanine dye, DiI, and then photoconverted, or were 
labelled by intracellular injection with Neurobiotin. The marmoset has two types 
of horizontal cell, H1 and H2, which have dendritic and axonal morphology similar
to their counterparts in Old World monkeys and human. The dendritic-field size of
both cell types increases with distance from the fovca. Both types make contact
with the vast majority of the cones within their dendritic field. The dendrites
of H1 cells in marmoset contact almost twice as many cones as H1 cells in macaque
at an equivalent eccentricity. With increasing distance from the fovea, H1 cells 
make contact with more cones but have, on average, fewer terminal knobs inserted 
in each cone. The increase in dendritic-field area of H1 cells is balanced by a
decrease in spatial density (from 4500 cells/mm2 at 25 deg eccentricity to 1000
cells/mm2 in far peripheral retina), so coverage of the retina remains fairly
constant, between 5 and 8. Overall, the results show that the qualitative
morphological properties, as well as quantitative population properties of
horizontal cells, are common to both New World and Old World primates.

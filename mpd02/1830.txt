Herpesvirus saimiri (HVS) is a γ-herpesvirus that expresses Sm class U RNAs
(HSURs) in latently infected marmoset T cells. By deep sequencing, we identified 
six HVS microRNAs (miRNAs) that are derived from three hairpin structures located
immediately downstream of the 3' end processing signals of three of the HSURs.
The viral miRNAs associate with Ago proteins and are biologically active. We
confirmed that the expression of the two classes of viral noncoding RNAs is
linked by identifying chimeric HSUR-pre-miRNA transcripts. We show that HVS miRNA
biogenesis relies on cis-acting elements specifically required for synthesis and 
processing of Sm class RNAs. Knockdown of protein components in vivo and
processing assays in vitro demonstrated that HVS does not utilize the
Microprocessor complex that generates most host miRNAs. Instead, the Integrator
complex cleaves to generate the 3' end of the HSUR and the pre-miRNA hairpin.
Exportin-5 and Dicer are then required to generate mature viral miRNAs.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) latent membrane protein 2A (LMP2A) is expressed on the
membrane of B-lymphocytes and blocks B cell receptor (BCR) signaling in
EBV-transformed B-lymphocytes in vitro. The LMP2A amino-terminal domain, which is
essential for the LMP2A-mediated block of B cell signal transduction, contains
eight tyrosine residues. Three of these tyrosine residues (Y74, Y85, and Y112)
have been demonstrated to be essential for the LMP2A-mediated block on protein
tyrosine phosphorylation, calcium mobilization, and induction of BZLF1 expression
after BCR activation. To investigate the importance of tyrosines at positions 60,
64, and 101 on B cell signaling, EBV recombinants were constructed containing a
tyrosine-to-phenylalanine point mutation at amino acid 60, 64, or 101 within
LMP2A. Tyrosine phosphorylation, calcium mobilization, and induction of BZLF1
expression were not affected by any of the tyrosine point mutations after BCR
activation. In addition, constitutive phosphorylation of LMP2A was unaffected by 
any of the tyrosine point mutations. These data indicate that tyrosines 60, 64,
and 101 are not essential for the LMP2A-mediated block of B cell signal
transduction in transformed cell lines.

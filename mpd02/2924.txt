GBV-B virus is a close relative to hepatitis C virus (HCV) that causes hepatitis 
in tamarins, and thus, is an attractive surrogate model for HCV. In this study,
we demonstrate that the host range of GBV-B extends to the common marmoset with
an infection profile similar to that observed for tamarins. Marmoset hepatocytes 
were susceptible to in vitro infection with GBV-B. Virus was efficiently secreted
into the medium, and approximately 25% of hepatocytes were positive for NS3
staining. In an attempt to induce persistent infections, tamarins were
immunosuppressed with FK506 and inoculated with GBV-B. Although no chronic
infections were induced, the duration of viremia was increased in most animals.
In one animal, the duration of viremia was extended to 46 weeks, but viral
clearance occurred 18 weeks after stopping FK506 therapy. The greater
availability of marmosets in comparison to tamarins will greatly facilitate
future research efforts with this model.

The physiological mechanisms of parental and alloparental care in cooperatively
breeding nonhuman primate species such as the common marmoset (Callithrix
jacchus) are poorly known. In this study, we examined prolactin and cortisol
plasma levels of fathers and older offspring of both sexes, with and without
previous experience in infant carrying, around parturition and during infant
carrying. Blood samples were collected from fathers and older offspring and
prolactin and cortisol were measured by RIA and EIA, respectively. Prolactin
levels of both caretakers were not influenced by infant's birth, previous
experience or proximity to parturition. However, prolactin levels increased in
both caretakers while in physical contact with infants and also with the number
of infants being carried in older offspring. These findings suggest that
increased prolactin seems to be mainly due to physical effort rather than a
physiological trigger of paternal and alloparental care in common marmosets.
Cortisol levels were higher for experienced fathers shortly before parturition
which could act to reinforce affiliative bonds between breeding males and females
at this time or in the ability of males to detect the proximity of the
parturition or both.

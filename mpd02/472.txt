Sex differences in human cognitive performance are well characterized. However,
the neural correlates of these differences remain elusive. This issue may be
clarified using nonhuman primates, for which sociocultural influences are
minimized. We used the marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) to investigate sex
differences in two aspects of executive function: reversal learning and
intradimensional/extradimensional (ID/ED) set shifting. Stress reactivity and
motor function were also assessed. In agreement with human literature, females
needed more trials than males to acquire the reversals. No sex differences in ED 
set shifting or motivational measures were observed. The findings suggest
enhanced habit formation in females, perhaps due to striatal estrogenic effects. 
Both sexes showed increased urinary cortisol during social separation stressor,
but females showed an earlier increase in cortisol and a greater increase in
agitated locomotion, possibly indicating enhanced stress reactivity. Independent 
of sex, basal cortisol predicted cognitive performance. No sex differences were
found in motor performance. Associations between brain networks and reversal
learning performance were investigated using resting state fMRI. Resting state
functional connectivity (rsFC) analyses revealed sex differences in cognitive
networks, with differences in overall neural network metrics and specific
regions, including the prefrontal cortex, caudate, putamen, and nucleus
accumbens. Correlations between cognitive flexibility and neural connectivity
indicate that sex differences in cognitive flexibility are related to
sex-dependent patterns of resting brain networks. Overall, our findings reveal
sex differences in reversal learning, brain networks, and their relationship in
the marmoset, positioning this species as an excellent model to investigate the
biological basis of cognitive sex differences.

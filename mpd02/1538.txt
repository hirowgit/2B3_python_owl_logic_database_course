The stability of mRNA and its translation is a vital process necessary for proper
protein production. The specificity of the regulation is controlled by specific
RNA motifs and regulatory proteins. Pumilio/fem-3 mRNA-binding factor (PUF)
proteins are usually used in regulating mRNA stability as well as translation.
Here, we optimized a PUF protein target finder program to understand the natural 
diversity of RNA recognition by this family of proteins. ExonSuite is available
to compile and run at https://github.com/dilanustek/ExonSuite.

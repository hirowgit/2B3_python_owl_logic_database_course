Cemented annulation as an age criterion in the common marmoset (Callithrix
jacchus).

Stott GG, Sis RF, Levy BM.

Teeth from 18 marmosets, seven months to 5.8 years of age, were studied
histologically. A minimum of one dark and one light band comprised one cemental
annulation. Age was estimated by counting the number of annulations and adding
four months to premolar and eight months to canine teeth for tooth development.
Cemental annulations were most consistent near the gingival border on the labial 
aspect of the tooth. The method will be valuable in estimating the ages of
marmosets and other nonhuman primates.

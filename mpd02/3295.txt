Humans and the cotton top tamarin, a model for colitis and colorectal cancer,
share carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) moieties. We quantified CEA in colonic
washings and extracts in both, and CEA bands were confirmed by Western blot. We
compared CEA-family expression in tissues and serum in the tamarin with that of
the common marmoset, which develops colitis but not cancer. CEA levels are higher
in tamarin washings compared with humans, and higher than in marmosets extracts
(P<0.005). CEA molecular species appear to be specific, and human CEA-family
member epitopes are also found in these primates. The higher CEA levels in the
tamarin may reflect the overall higher cancer prevalence.

The effects of the anxiogenic agents FG7142, caffeine, pentylenetetrazole, and
amphetamine were assessed in two anxiety situations in the marmoset, first in an 
"anxiogenic" test based on the animal's response to a human observer standing in 
front of the home cage and second in a low-anxiety situation where animals
behaviour was videotaped in the absence of the observer. In response to the human
observer, the anxiolytic agent diazepam (0.1-2.5 mg/kg, SC) was shown to reduce
the intensity of behaviours such as postures, while increasing time spent on the 
cage front. In this test, with the exception of amphetamine, which only modified 
responding at stereotypic doses, the anxiogenic agents failed to modify marmoset 
behaviour. In contrast, in the low-anxiety filming protocol the anxiogenic agents
consistently reduced measures of locomotor activity while increasing the amount
of time animals spent in the nest box. It is suggested that the low-anxiety
protocol may be useful to evaluate drug-induced anxiogenesis and in studies of
withdrawal from chronic anxiolytic treatment or drugs of abuse.

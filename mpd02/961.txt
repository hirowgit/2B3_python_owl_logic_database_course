The striatum plays important motor, associative and cognitive roles in brain
functions. However, the rodent dorsolateral (the primate putamen) and dorsomedial
(the primate caudate nucleus) striatum are not anatomically separated, making it 
difficult to distinguish their functions. By contrast, anatomical separation
exists between the caudate nucleus and putamen in primates. Here, we successfully
decreased dopamine D1 receptor (D1R) or D2R mRNA expression levels selectively in
the marmoset caudate using shRNA knockdown techniques, as determined using
positron emission tomography imaging with specific D1R and D2R ligands and
postmortem in situ hybridization analysis. We then conducted a voxel-based
correlation analysis between binding potential values of PET imaging and visual
discrimination learning task performance in these genetically modified marmosets 
to find a critical role for the caudate D2R but no apparent role for the caudate 
D1R. This latter finding challenges the current understanding of the mechanisms
underlying D1R activation in the caudate.

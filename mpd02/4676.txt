Spontaneous neoplasms of the marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). Oral and
nasopharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas.

Betton GR.

Eight spontaneous highly invasive oral and nasopharyngeal squamous cell
carcinomas were observed over an 18-month period in a breeding colony of the
common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). Affected marmosets were predominantly males
over four years of age. The incidence of this tumor in the four-year-plus age
group was 4.9%. The tumors were locally invasive through the palate to the nasal 
cavity, retrobulbar space and cranial cavity in some marmosets with lung
metastases present in three cases.

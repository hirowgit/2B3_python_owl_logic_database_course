BACKGROUND: Myeloid sarcoma is a rare manifestation of myeloproliferative
disorder defined as an extramedullary mass composed of myeloid precursor cells. A
9-month old, female, common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) had increased
respiratory effort.
METHODS: A complete necropsy with histology and immunohistochemistry was
performed.
RESULTS: The thymus was replaced by a firm, gray-tan mass with a faint green
tint, filling over 50% of the thoracic cavity. Sheets of granulocytes, lymphoid
cells, nucleated erythrocytes, megakaryocytes, and hematopoietic precursors of
indeterminate cell lineage replaced the thymus, perithymic connective tissue,
mediastinal adipose tissues, epicardium, and much of the myocardium. The cells
demonstrated diffuse strong cytoplasmic immunoreactivity for lysozyme, and
strong, multifocal membranous immunoreactivity for CD117.
CONCLUSION: We report the first case of a myeloid sarcoma in a common marmoset
(C. jacchus), similar to reported human cases of mediastinal myeloid sarcoma, and
present a review of myeloproliferative diseases from the veterinary literature.

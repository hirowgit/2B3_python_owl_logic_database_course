Human DNA methylation data have previously been used to develop highly accurate
biomarkers of aging ("epigenetic clocks"). Subsequent studies demonstrate that
similar epigenetic clocks can also be developed for mice and many other mammals. 
Here, we describe epigenetic clocks for common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus)
based on novel DNA methylation data generated from highly conserved mammalian
CpGs that were profiled using a custom Infinium array
(HorvathMammalMethylChip40). From these, we developed and present here two
epigenetic clocks for marmosets that are applicable to whole blood samples. We
find that the human-marmoset clock for relative age exhibits moderately high age 
correlations in two other non-human primate species: vervet monkeys and rhesus
macaques. In a separate cohort of marmosets, we tested whether intervention with 
rapamycin, a drug shown to extend lifespan in mice, would alter the epigenetic
age of marmosets, as measured by the marmoset epigenetic clocks. These clocks did
not detect significant effects of rapamycin on the epigenetic age of marmoset
blood. The common marmoset stands out from other mammals in that it is not
possible to build accurate estimators of sex based on DNA methylation data: the
accuracy of a random forest predictor of sex (66%) was substantially lower than
that observed for other mammals (which is close to 100%). Overall, the epigenetic
clocks developed here for the common marmoset are expected to be useful for age
estimation of wild-born animals and for anti-aging studies in this species.

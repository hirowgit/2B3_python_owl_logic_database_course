Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an invaluable tool for the diagnosis and
monitoring of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) as well as for the study of
the disease pathophysiology. Because of its strong clinical, radiological and
histopathological similarities with the human disease, experimental autoimmune
encephalomyelitis (EAE) in the common marmoset has been studied more intensively 
over the past several years. Here, we review the current knowledge on MRI in the 
marmoset EAE, and we outline the physiopathological significance and
translational values of these studies with respect to MS. Accumulating evidences 
suggest that the application of conventional, as well as non-conventional, MRI
techniques in the marmoset EAE is a promising approach to elucidate the
pathological processes underlying the development of inflammatory demyelinated
lesions in the central nervous system, potentially improving the identification
and development of new therapeutics.

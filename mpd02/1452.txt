Both gestational cortisol exposure (GCE) and variability in postnatal
environments can shape the later-life behavioral and endocrine outcomes of the
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. We examined the influence of GCE and
social play on HPA functioning in developing marmosets. Maternal urinary cortisol
samples were collected across pregnancy to determine GCE for 28 marmoset
offspring (19 litters). We administered a social separation stressor to offspring
at 6, 12, and 18 months of age, during which we collected urinary cortisol
samples and behavioral observations. Increased GCE was associated with increased 
basal cortisol levels and cortisol reactivity, but the strength of this
relationship decreased across age. Increased social play was associated with
decreased basal cortisol levels and a marginally greater reduction in cortisol
reactivity as offspring aged, regardless of offspring GCE. Thus, GCE is
associated with HPA functioning, but socially enriching postnatal environments
can alter the effects associated with increased fetal exposure to
glucocorticoids.

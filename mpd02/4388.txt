Medial hypothalamic lesions cause major deficits in sexual receptivity in a
variety of mammalian species. Effects of such lesions upon sexual receptivity in 
female primates have not been investigated. Two experiments are described in
which thermal lesions were made in the hypothalamus in 11 ovariectomized or
ovariectomized/adrenalectomized, oestradiol-treated common marmosets.
Proceptivity (sexual initiating behaviour) was reduced or abolished by lesions in
the dorsomedial or ventromedial hypothalamus. Sexual receptivity was unaffected
except in 3 females in which damage to the ventromedial area was associated with 
a 25-42% increase in terminations of males' mounts. However, this effect was
reversed by treating females with oestradiol. Therefore, medial hypothalamic
lesions have pronounced effects upon proceptivity in the marmoset, whereas
effects upon receptivity are much less pronounced or absent. These results are
discussed in relation to the evolution of the hormonal control of receptivity in 
anthropoid primates as compared to other mammals.

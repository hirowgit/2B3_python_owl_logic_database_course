Centromere protein B (CENP-B) is one of the major proteins involved in centromere
formation, binding to centromeric repetitive DNA by recognizing a 17 bp motif
called the CENP-B box. Hominids (humans and great apes) carry large numbers of
CENP-B boxes in alpha satellite DNA (AS, the major centromeric repetitive DNA of 
simian primates). Only negative results have been reported regarding the presence
of the CENP-B box in other primate taxa. Consequently, it is widely believed that
the CENP-B box is confined, within primates, to the hominids. We report here that
the common marmoset, a New World monkey, contains an abundance of CENP-B boxes in
its AS. First, in a long contig sequence we constructed and analysed, we
identified the motif in 17 of the 38 alpha satellite repeat units. We then
sequenced terminal regions of additional clones and found the motif in many of
them. Immunostaining of marmoset cells demonstrated that CENP-B binds to DNA in
the centromeric regions of chromosomes. Therefore, functional CENP-B boxes are
not confined to hominids. Our results indicate that the efficiency of
identification of the CENP-B box may depend largely on the sequencing methods
used, and that the CENP-B box in centromeric repetitive DNA may be more common
than researchers previously thought.

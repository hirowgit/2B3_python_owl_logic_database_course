The common marmoset has emerged as a popular model in neuroscience research, in
part due to its reproductive efficiency, genetic and neuroanatomical similarities
to humans and the successful generation of transgenic lines. Stereotaxic
procedures in marmosets are guided by 2D stereotaxic atlases, which are
constructed with a limited number of animals and fail to account for
inter-individual variability in skull and brain size. Here, we developed a
frameless imaging-guided stereotaxic system that improves upon traditional
approaches by using subject-specific registration of computed tomography (CT),
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) data to
identify a surgical target, namely the putamen, in two marmosets. The skull
surface was laser-scanned to create a point cloud that was registered to the 3D
reconstruction of the skull from CT. Reconstruction of the skull, as well as of
the brain from MR images, was crucial for surgical planning. Localisation and
injection into the putamen was done using a 6-axis robotic arm controlled by a
surgical navigation software (Brainsight™). Integration of subject-specific
registration and frameless stereotaxic navigation allowed target localisation
specific to each animal. Injection of alpha-synuclein fibrils into the putamen
triggered progressive neurodegeneration of the nigro-striatal system, a key
feature of Parkinson's disease. Four months post-surgery, a PET scan found
evidence of nigro-striatal denervation, supporting accurate targeting of the
putamen during co-registration and subsequent surgery. Our results suggest that
this approach, coupled with frameless stereotaxic neuronavigation, is accurate in
localising surgical targets and can be used to assess endpoints for longitudinal 
studies.

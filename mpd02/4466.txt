According to current concepts of pre-ovulatory folliculogenesis in primate
ovaries, each growing follicle has a 'threshold' requirement for stimulation by
FSH which must be met if it is to enter the oestrogen-secretory phase of
pre-ovulatory development. Until recently, our understanding of the
intra-follicular mechanisms underlying FSH action on granulosa cells was based
largely on information from non-primate laboratory animals, mainly polyovulators 
such as rats. The present paper describes studies on FSH-regulated granulosa cell
function in relation to pre-ovulatory development in vivo and in vitro using a
laboratory primate, the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). Measurement of
aromatase activity is used as an index of granulosa cell cytodifferentiation to
verify three major tenets of the 'threshold' hypothesis: (i) that granulosa cells
acquire increased responsiveness to FSH and LH during pre-ovulatory growth; (ii) 
that these developmentally related changes are directly induced by FSH; and (iii)
that intrafollicular steroids modify FSH action and thereby contribute to the
establishment of follicular FSH thresholds. The results obtained highlight the
value of this experimental animal model for studies of cellular and molecular
aspects of pre-ovulatory folliculogenesis which are relevant to human ovaries.

The absence of pathological hallmarks of progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) in
commonly used rodent models of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE)
hinders the development of adequate treatments for progressive disease. Work
reviewed here shows that such hallmarks are present in the EAE model in marmoset 
monkeys (Callithrix jacchus). The minimal requirement for induction of
progressive MS pathology is immunization with a synthetic peptide representing
residues 34-56 from human myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) formulated
with a mineral oil [incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA)]. Pathological aspects
include demyelination of cortical gray matter with microglia activation,
oxidative stress, and redistribution of iron. When the peptide is formulated in
complete Freund's adjuvant, which contains mycobacteria that relay strong
activation signals to myeloid cells, oxidative damage pathways are strongly
boosted leading to more intensive pathology. The proven absence of immune
potentiating danger signals in the MOG34-56/IFA formulation implies that a narrow
population of antigen-experienced T cells present in the monkey's immune
repertoire is activated. This novel pathway involves the interplay of
lymphocryptovirus-infected B cells with MHC class Ib/Caja-E restricted CD8+ CD56+
cytotoxic T lymphocytes.

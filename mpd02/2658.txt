Despite years of intensive research into multiple sclerosis (MS) scientists have 
not yet succeeded in developing an absolute therapy for the treatment of this
disabling disease of the human central nervous system. The wide immunological gap
between inbred rodent strains and the heterogeneous human population is probably 
the single most important factor that hampers the translation of scientific
principles developed in rodents into effective therapies for MS. Because of the
closer immunological proximity to humans, non-human primates provide useful
experimental models that may help to bridge this gap. Here we review the models
of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in rhesus macaques and common
marmosets. We will discuss the salient points of the models and suggest how these
may represent the spectrum of inflammatory demyelinating diseases of the central 
nervous system in humans.

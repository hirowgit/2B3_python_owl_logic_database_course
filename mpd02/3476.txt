SR 141716 (1 and 3 mg/kg p.o.), a selective central (CB1) cannabinoid receptor
antagonist, selectively reduced feeding of a very highly palatable cane-sugar
mixture in marmosets. In contrast, standard primate pellet intake was not
modified at the lower dose, but was slightly increased (+29%;p < 0.01) by the
higher dose of SR 141716. These results are in agreement with the hypothesis that
endogenous cannabinoid systems are involved in the modulation of the appetitive
value of food.

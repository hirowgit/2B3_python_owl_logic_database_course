BACKGROUND: Although repeated exposure to cocaine can induce hypervigilance and
conditioned-place-preference (CPP) in nonhuman primates (NHPs), more detailed
analyses are warranted since the outcome can be influenced by different factors.
METHODS: We evaluated in marmoset monkeys (Callithrix penicillata): (1) the onset
time-course and dose-dependent (3 or 7mg/kg; i.p.) profile of their
hypervigilance and CPP response to repeated cocaine exposure; (2) whether these
behavioral measures are still detectable after a 15-day no-drug period; (3) the
relationship between their hypervigilance and CPP responses; and (4) if these
behavioral changes correlate with pre- and post-drug behaviors (i.e., vigilance, 
locomotion, exploration), and/or first response to cocaine.
RESULTS: Hypervigilance had a slow-onset, was only effective with the 7mg/kg dose
of cocaine, lacked long-term conditioned effects and was not related to the
initial cocaine response or pre-drug behaviors, regardless of the dose tested.
CPP was promptly induced with the 3 and 7mg/kg doses, and had a dose-dependent
long-term effect and negative correlation with pre-drug locomotion and
exploration. Hypervigilance and CPP were not significantly correlated.
CONCLUSIONS: Although hypervigilance and CPP were induced, they had distinct
temporal and dose-dependent profiles, and were not equally co-expressed in the
same marmoset. Also, in NHPs, pre-drug locomotion and exploration were predictive
of the low-dose CPP response.

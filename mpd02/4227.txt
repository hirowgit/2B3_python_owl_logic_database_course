In order to ascertain whether or not sister-chromatid exchange (SCE) differs in
relation to sex, SCE rates in XX and XY cells from 10 specimens of marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus) were examined. The choice of this primate is particularly
suitable for three reasons: most individuals have a chimeric constitution, the X 
chromosome is quite large and the Y chromosome is particularly small. Therefore, 
the influence of possible differences in their exposure to the external
environment can be eliminated. The results obtained did not reveal any
significant difference between SCE rates in male and female cells in any of the
examined individuals.

Passive immunization of adult rats, hamsters and marmosets with rabbit
anti-seminal inhibin resulted in complete or partial block of fertility. The
antiserum treatment presumably neutralized endogenous inhibin resulting in an
unopposed rise in circulating FSH. This probably led to a refractoriness of the
testes to FSH resulting in complete spermatogenic arrest. Nevertheless, there was
no change in the mating behaviour of the animals. The antibodies also affected
the epididymal spermatozoa by causing large scale agglutination.

Object permanence in adult common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus): not everything 
is an "A-not-B" error that seems to be one.

In this paper, we describe a behaviour pattern similar to the "A-not-B" error
found in human infants and young apes in a monkey species, the common marmosets
(Callithrix jacchus). In contrast to the classical explanation, recently it has
been suggested that the "A-not-B" error committed by human infants is at least
partially due to misinterpretation of the hider's ostensively communicated object
hiding actions as potential 'teaching' demonstrations during the A trials. We
tested whether this so-called Natural Pedagogy hypothesis would account for the
A-not-B error that marmosets commit in a standard object permanence task, but
found no support for the hypothesis in this species. Alternatively, we present
evidence that lower level mechanisms, such as attention and motivation, play an
important role in committing the "A-not-B" error in marmosets. We argue that
these simple mechanisms might contribute to the effect of undeveloped object
representational skills in other species including young non-human primates that 
commit the A-not-B error.

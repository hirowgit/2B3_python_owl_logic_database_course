BACKGROUND: Chronic gastroenteropathies, including gluten sensitivity and
marmoset wasting syndrome, frequently occur in captive colonies of common
marmosets (Callithrix jacchus). Early identification and diagnosis of affected
animals are desirable. Endoscopic examination of the colon in marmosets is
described, but the small intestine can harbor significant mucosal lesions not
representing those in the colon. Evaluating the small intestine currently
requires invasive surgical biopsies due to the small patient size, carrying a
risk of severe complications.
METHODS: Endoscopic intubation and multisite biopsy of the duodenum/proximal
jejunum are demonstrated in 10 marmosets under general anesthesia.
RESULTS: Esophagogastroduodenoscopy with colonoscopy efficiently aid in examining
the gastrointestinal tract and obtaining an antemortem histologic diagnosis in
marmosets with chronic gastrointestinal signs.
CONCLUSIONS: This minimally invasive technique is feasible in marmosets. Future
investigations into the pathogenesis of chronic gastroenteropathies will benefit 
from these data, leading to improved animal welfare and better individual and
colony health management.

Necropsy of a 17-month-old male common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) with a
history of increased abdominal girth resulted in the finding of a unilateral
polycystic renal neoplasm. Detailed histopathologic and immunohistochemical
investigations revealed different tissue types within the tumor including stromal
connective tissue and fusiform mesenchymal cell formations surrounding blastemal 
cells as well as different developmental stages of organ-specific epithelial
cells accompanied by extensive cyst formation. Metastases were not observed. In
consideration of the macroscopic, histologic, and immunohistochemical findings,
the tumor was classified as a nephroblastoma closely resembling the so-called
Wilms' tumor, a malignant embryonic renal tumor frequently observed in humans,
especially in young children. In contrast, this tumor entity has rarely been
observed in nonhuman primates. This report represents the first documented case
of a cystic variant of nephroblastoma in a nonhuman primate.

In order to test new orally active iron chelators in a predictive way, a primate 
model has been developed. This model makes use of the marmoset monkey (Callithrix
jacchus) and its overall design is similar to a previously reported monkey model.
However, this new model enables a higher compound throughput and requires lower
amounts of test compound because the animals are much easier to handle and have
much lower body weights. The marmosets were iron-overloaded by three
intraperitoneal injections of iron (III) hydroxide polyisomaltose. For the
iron-balance studies, the animals were kept in metabolic cages and were
maintained on a low-iron diet in order to reduce faecal background. After
compound administration, the excretion of iron in urine and faeces was followed
for 2 d. A series of well-known chelators was tested for validation of the model.
In particular, comparison of the iron-clearing properties of DFO, L1, CP94 and
HBED in marmosets and humans demonstrated the predictive value of the model and
justify our expectation that if iron chelators such as CGP65015, ICL670A and
CGP75254A are active in marmosets, they will be active in humans as well.

Vocal production is hierarchical in the time domain. These hierarchies build upon
biomechanical and neural dynamics across various timescales. We review studies in
marmoset monkeys, songbirds, and other vertebrates. To organize these data in an 
accessible and across-species framework, we interpret the different timescales of
vocal production as belonging to different levels of an autonomous systems
hierarchy. The first level accounts for vocal acoustics produced on short
timescales; subsequent levels account for longer timescales of vocal output. The 
hierarchy of autonomous systems that we put forth accounts for vocal patterning, 
sequence generation, dyadic interactions, and context dependence by sequentially 
incorporating central pattern generators, intrinsic drives, and sensory signals
from the environment. We then show the framework's utility by providing an
integrative explanation of infant vocal production learning in which social
feedback modulates infant vocal acoustics through the tuning of a drive signal.

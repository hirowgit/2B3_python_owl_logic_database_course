Pathomorphological studies described pathological heterogeneity in patients with 
multiple sclerosis (MS). Different effector mechanisms might therefore be
responsible for lesion formation in MS. The present report shows that myelin
oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-induced experimental autoimmune
encephalomyelitis (EAE) in common marmoset monkeys reflects one specific lesional
subtype of MS, namely MS pattern II lesions with antibody/complement-mediated
damage. MOG-induced EAE in marmoset monkeys will, therefore, provide an ideal
model for therapeutic approaches directed against B-cell/antibody/complement in
MS.

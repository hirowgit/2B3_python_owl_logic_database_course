Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection in animal model systems has been studied
previously in marmosets and tamarins using serology and PCR of saliva. Here we
directly demonstrated long-term persistence of EBV in the peripheral blood of
marmosets by assaying EBER RNA expression. A new reverse transcription-PCR assay,
able to distinguish a naturally occurring strain polymorphism in EBER 2 that may 
be useful as a strain marker for monitoring persistence and interactions between 
multiple strains in the same animal or person, has been developed. In situ
hybridization and immunohistochemistry have also been used to search for
EBV-infected cells in the animals. The carrier state in the common marmoset is
similar to that of humans in that it is asymptomatic, long-lived and displays a
very low level of circulating virus-infected cells. It differs from the human in 
lacking the characteristic antibody response to EBNA 1.

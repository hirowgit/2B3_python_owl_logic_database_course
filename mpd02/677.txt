We studied three calls of common marmosets, Callithrix jacchus, elicited in the
context of food. Call A, but not B or C, had been described previously as a food 
call. We presented insects (live mealworms or crickets) and fruit (banana or
blueberries) and used playbacks of calls. We found that Call C was produced only 
in response to seeing insects, and not fruit; it consistently signaled the
availability of insects (includes mealworms), and more so when this food could be
seen but not consumed. Playback of Call C caused the marmosets to stop feeding on
a less preferred food (banana) and, instead, go to inspect a location where
mealworms had been found previously, providing evidence that it has referential
meaning. No such immediate response was elicited on hearing Call A or background 
noise. Call A differed from C in that it was produced more frequently when the
marmosets were consuming the food than when they could only see it, and call A
showed no specificity between insects and fruit. Call B was emitted less
frequently than the A or C calls and, by the marmosets that were tested alone,
most often to crickets. An audience effect occurred, in that all three calls were
emitted more often when the marmosets were tested alone than when in pairs.
Recognition of the functional significance of marmoset calls can lead to improved
husbandry of marmosets in captivity.

Nonhuman primates (NHPs) have been widely used in reproductive biology,
neuroscience, and drug development since a number of primate species are
phylogenetically close to humans. In this review, we summarize the use of NHPs
for nonclinical application in the reproductive system disorders including the
loss or failure of an organ or tissue. Causes of infertility include congenital
aplasia and acquired disorders of the reproductive organs. In addition,
anti-cancer treatments can deplete ovarian follicles, leading to premature
ovarian failure, infertility and long-term health risks. Along with a limited
supply of human reproductive organs, anatomic/physiologic similarities to humans 
support the need for NHP models (New-World monkeys such as the common marmoset
and Old-World monkeys such as cynomolgus and rhesus monkeys) to promote the
advances in female infertility studies. For maintaining and executing animal
studies using NHP, special protocols including animal care, anesthetic protocol, 
surgical technique, and immunosuppressive protocol are necessary. With a growing 
interest in the potential therapies such as endometrial tissue engineering, and
ovary/follicle cryopreservation and grafting in Korea, this review can be useful 
in selecting appropriate animal models and can bridge between nonclinical studies
and clinical applications by providing detailed information on the use of NHPs in
the field of reproductive organ disorders.

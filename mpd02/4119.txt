The relative distribution of sensitizer drugs in the prostate and its contiguous 
organs is of importance in the treatment of localized prostatic cancer with
photodynamic therapy. Using the primate model, whose prostate is both
morphologically and physiologically homologous with its human counterpart, the
distribution of hematoporphyrin derivative (HpD) amongst organs of urological
interest was determined. Hematoporphyrin derivative levels were comparatively low
in both caudal and cranial prostatic lobes (0.93-1.77 micrograms/g) and were
similar to those in rectum, urethra and the skin. The reticuloendothelial organs,
liver, spleen and also the kidney accumulated the highest quantities of porphyrin
(4.76-9.8 micrograms/g, liver > spleen > kidney). Despite a high avidity of
prostatic tissue for zinc, a zinc-metalloporphyrin (Zn-HpD) did not concentrate
selectively in the prostate. The results are of clinical value in view of the
homology between the primate and the human.

Porous silicon nanoparticles (pSiNP), modified to target dendritic cells (DC),
provide an alternate strategy for the delivery of immunosuppressive drugs. Here, 
we aimed to develop a DC-targeting pSiNP displaying c-type lectin, dendritic
cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN), 
and CD11c monoclonal antibodies. The in vivo tracking of these fluorescent
DC-targeting nanoparticles was assessed in both C57BL/6 mice and common marmosets
( Callithrix jacchus) by intravenous injection (20 mg/kg). Rapamycin and
ovalbumin (OVA)323-339 peptide loaded pSiNP were employed to evaluate their
ability to generate murine CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ regulatory T-cells in vivo within OVA 
sensitized mice. In vivo, pSiNP migrated to the liver, kidneys, lungs, and spleen
in both mice and marmosets. Flow cytometry confirmed pSiNP uptake by splenic and 
peripheral blood DC when functionalized with targeting antibodies. C57BL/6 OVA
sensitized mice injected with CD11c-pSiNP loaded with rapamycin + OVA323-339
produced a 5-fold higher number of splenic regulatory T-cells compared to control
mice, at 40 days post-pSiNP injection. These results demonstrate the importance
of the immobilized targeting antibodies to enhance cellular uptake and enable the
in vivo generation of splenic regulatory T-cells.

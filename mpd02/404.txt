The viability of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) depends on energy generated by 
its respiratory chain. Cytochrome bc1-aa3 oxidase and type-2 NADH dehydrogenase
(NDH-2) are respiratory chain components predicted to be essential, and
are currently targeted for drug development. Here we demonstrate that an Mtb
cytochrome bc1-aa3 oxidase deletion mutant is viable and only partially
attenuated in mice. Moreover, treatment of Mtb-infected marmosets with a
cytochrome bc1-aa3 oxidase inhibitor controls disease progression and reduces
lesion-associated inflammation, but most lesions become cavitary. Deletion of
both NDH-2 encoding genes (Δndh-2 mutant) reveals that the essentiality of NDH-2 
as shown in standard growth media is due to the presence of fatty acids. The
Δndh-2 mutant is only mildly attenuated in mice and not differently susceptible
to clofazimine, a drug in clinical use proposed to engage NDH-2. These results
demonstrate the intrinsic plasticity of Mtb's respiratory chain, and highlight
the challenges associated with targeting the pathogen's respiratory enzymes for
tuberculosis drug development.

The study of subtle changes in motor and cognitive function after exposure to
MPTP might serve as a guide to the very earliest stages of Parkinson's disease.
Studies in nonhuman primates and man exposed to MPTP who remained asymptomatic or
recovered completely are reviewed. The question of the relationship between the
degree and extent of damage to the nigrostriatal dopamine system and changes in
motor and cognitive (behavioral) function is addressed. What guidance they
provide in the study of subclinical or preclinical Parkinson's disease is
discussed.

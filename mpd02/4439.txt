The differentiation of spermatids in the marmoset (Callithrix jacchus, n = 9)
testis is described here at the light-microscopic level employing serial semithin
sections. The definition of 8 different phases of spermiogenesis, i.e. the
formation of spermatids, is based upon the changes in the development of nucleus,
acrosome and flagellum.

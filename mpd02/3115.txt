A series of (3,5-trans)-2-oxo-5-phenyl-1,2,3,5-tetrahydro-4,1-benzoxazepine
derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for squalene synthase inhibitory and
cholesterol biosynthesis inhibitory activities. Through modification of
substituents of the lead compounds 1a and 1b, it was found that
4,1-benzoxazepine-3-acetic acid derivatives with isobutyl and neopentyl groups at
the 1-position, the chloro atom at the 7-position, and the chloro and methoxy
groups at the 2'-position on the 5-phenyl ring, had potent squalene synthase
inhibitory activity. Among such compounds, the 5-(2,3-dimethoxyphenyl) derivative
2t exhibited potent inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis in HepG2 cells. As a
result of optical resolution study of 2t, the absolute stereochemistry required
for inhibitory activity was determined to be 3R,5S. In vivo study showed that the
sodium salt of
(3R,5S)-7-chloro-5-(2,3-dimethoxyphenyl)-1-neopentyl-2-oxo-1,2,3,5-tetrahydro-4,1
-benzoxazepine-3-acetic acid 20 effectively reduced plasma cholesterol in
marmosets.

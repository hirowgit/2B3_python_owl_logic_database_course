The aim of this investigation was to study epidemiological aspects of
paracoccidioidomycosis, the main endemic systemic mycosis in Brazil. This study
was carried out using the paracoccidioidin delayed hypersensitivity test in 96
Latin American wild mammals, including 49 arboreal animals (primates): 33 Cebus
apella (weeping-capuchin), 16 Callithrix jacchus (marmoset); and 47 terrestrial
animals (carnivora): 37 Nasua nasua (coatimundi), and 10 Felidae [Panthera onca
(jaguar), Felis paradalis (ocelot), Felis wiedii (margay), Felis tigrina (wild
cat) and Felis geoffroyi (wild cat)], taking their behaviour and habitat into
consideration. When the levels of paracoccidiodin positive reactions were
examined, terrestrial animals showed significantly higher rates (82.98%) while
arboreal animals showed lower reactivity (22.45%) (P < 0.01). The data are
relevant because there are quite a few papers regarding domestic and wild animals
and this study may help the understanding of some aspects of the parasite
ecology. These results point to the soil as the most probable reservoir of
Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, and this is possibly the ecological niche of the
saprophytic phase in nature.

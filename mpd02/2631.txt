We examined the fine-scale mapping of the visual world within the primary visual 
cortex of the marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus) using differential optical
imaging. We stimulated two sets of complementary stripe-like locations in turn,
subtracting them to generate the cortical representations of continuous bands of 
visual space. Rotating this stimulus configuration makes it possible to map
different spatial axes within the primary visual cortex. In a similar manner,
shifting the stimulated locations between trials makes it possible to map
retinotopy at an even finer scale. Using these methods we found no evidence of
any local anisotropies or distortions in the cortical representation of visual
space. This is despite the fact that orientation preference is mapped in a
discontinuous manner across the surface of marmoset V1. Overall, our results
indicate that space is mapped in a continuous and smooth manner in the primary
visual cortex of the common marmoset.

Development of a marmoset colony in Australia.

McIntosh GH, Looker JW.

A breeding nucleus of 15 pairs of Callithrix jacchus jacchus was imported from an
established colony in the United Kingdom in 1978, and these have now multiplied
to 137 animals. Good reproductive efficiency and growth rates have occurred in
this colony, with minimal problems from diseases of nutritional or infectious
origin. One episode of cessation of breeding and abortions was attributed to
excessive noise and disturbance of the normal routine.

Thirteen adult common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) were given once-monthly
injections of haloperidol decanoate (5-15 mg/kg i.m.) for one year. Thereafter,
drug-free and treatment periods alternated at 3-month intervals. After 2.5 to 14 
months, 12 monkeys showed symptoms of tardive dyskinesia (TD), such as periocular
and perioral twitchings, tongue protrusions, masticatory movements, and choreic
movements in arms and legs. When TD symptoms were evident, the periodic treatment
was interrupted and symptoms persisted for at least 5 months after the last
haloperidol dose, worsened by injection of the anticholinergic drug biperiden. An
injection of nondepot haloperidol (0.12 or 0.25 mg/kg) produced a reduction of TD
symptoms. At the end of the study, nondepot haloperidol was injected once a week 
at two doses (0.12 and 0.25 mg/kg i.m.). A syndrome of excitation with peculiar
behavior, interpreted as acute dystonia, was precipitated in all animals. The
animals showed sustained retrocollis, climbing upside down, biting the perch,
repetitive turnings, and frequent backward movements. The dystonic movements
lasted approximately 6 hours and were reduced but not completely extinguished by 
biperiden (0.1 mg/kg). The TD syndrome registered in marmosets may provide a
useful model for screening new antipsychotics for their propensity to induce TD.

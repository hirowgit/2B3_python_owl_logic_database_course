Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex multisystem, chronic and so far incurable
disease with significant unmet medical needs. The incidence of PD increases with 
aging and the expected burden will continue to escalate with our aging
population. Since its discovery in the 1961 levodopa has remained the gold
standard pharmacotherapy for PD. However, the progressive nature of the
neurodegenerative process in and beyond the nigrostriatal system causes a
multitude of side effects, including levodopa-induced dyskinesia within 5 years
of therapy. Attenuating dyskinesia has been a significant challenge in the
clinical management of PD. We report on a small molecule that eliminates the
expression of levodopa-induced dyskinesia and significantly improves PD-like
symptoms. The lead compound PD13R we discovered is a dopamine D3 receptor partial
agonist with high affinity and selectivity, orally active and with desirable
drug-like properties. Future studies are aimed at developing this lead compound
for treating PD patients with dyskinesia.

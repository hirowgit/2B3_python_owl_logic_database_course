In the present study, changes in the immunohistochemical localization of
leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) in the endometrium during various phases of
ovarian cyclicity of the common marmoset have been reported. LIF was absent
during the early and late follicular phases. LIF was observed mainly in the
cytoplasm of the endometrial glands during the early luteal phase, reached
maximum intensity during the mid-luteal phase and declined again during late
luteal phase. In-situ hybridization also showed a similar cyclic pattern in the
expression of LIF. Stromal cells only showed signals for LIF during the
mid-luteal phase. In ovariectomized marmosets, graded dosages of oestradiol alone
failed to induce the appearance of LIF protein. Progesterone treatment following 
oestradiol priming, however, induced distinct glandular localization of LIF,
indicating that LIF is a progesterone-dependent protein. Thus endometrial LIF is 
under maternal control and is secreted in response to the increased progesterone 
concentrations in circulation. It is possible that high concentrations of LIF
during mid-luteal phase may prepare the endometrium for blastocyst implantation
in marmosets.

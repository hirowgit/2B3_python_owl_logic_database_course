The phylogenetic proximity between non-human primate species and humans is
reflected by a high degree of immunological similarity. Non-human primates
therefore provide important experimental models for disorders in the human
population that are caused by the immune system, such as autoimmune diseases. In 
this paper we describe non-human primate models of multiple sclerosis, a chronic 
inflammatory and demyelinating disease of the human central nervous system. While
reviewing data from the literature and our own research we will discuss the
unique role of such models in the research of basic disease mechanisms and the
development of new therapies.

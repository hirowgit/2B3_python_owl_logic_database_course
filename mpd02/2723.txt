Ethanol-water (70:30 v/v) extracts from rice brans removed from seeds of two
blackish-purple pigmented (Sanhaehyanghyulla and Suwon 415) and one nonpigmented 
(Chuchung) brown rice cultivars were evaluated for antioxidative,
anti-tumor-promoting, and anticarcinogenic activities in chemical assays and in
mammalian cells (human leukemia HL-60, marmoset B lymphoblastoid B95-8, and
Chinese hamster V79 lung cells) by the following tests: inhibition of xanthine
oxidase activity; chelation of ferrous ions; reduction of potassium ferricyanide;
scavenging of superoxide anions, hydroxyl radicals, and intracellular peroxides; 
inhibition of 4-nitroquinoline N-oxide-induced mutagenesis; and inhibition of
phorbol ester-induced tumor promotion. The extracts from the pigmented rice seeds
had generally higher activities in all tests than did the extract from the
nonpigmented variety. The results suggest that brans from pigmented rice
varieties may provide a source of new natural antioxidants and anticarcinogens
and that such rice cultivars with high antioxidative potential also provide a
genetic resource for the development of new, improved rice cultivars that may
make it possible to enhance both the nutritional and medical value of rice-based 
diets.

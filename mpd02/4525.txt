Elevated urinary excretion of beta-aminoisobutyric acid and exposure to inorganic
lead.

beta-Aminoisobutyric acid (beta-AIB), a normal degradation product of thymine, a 
constituent of DNA and, to a lesser extent, of transfer RNA, is excreted in low
levels in human urine. We found that a group of iron workers occupationally
exposed to inorganic lead excreted high levels of urinary beta-AIB. Elevated
urinary excretion of beta-AIB was also observed in marmosets, Callithrix jacchus,
that received lead acetate in drinking water. Our results suggest that increased 
urinary excretion of beta-AIB could stem from damage to DNA on exposure to lead.

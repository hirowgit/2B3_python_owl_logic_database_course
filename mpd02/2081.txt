The vocal motor plan is one of the most fundamental and poorly understood
elements of primate vocal production. Here we tested whether a single vocal motor
plan comprises the full length of a vocalization. We hypothesized that if a
single motor plan was determined at vocal onset, the acoustic features early in
the call should be predictive of the subsequent call structure. Analyses were
performed on two classes of features in marmoset phee calls: continuous and
discrete. We first generated correlation matrices of all the continuous features 
of phee calls. Results showed that the start frequency of a phee's first pulse
significantly correlated with all subsequent spectral features. Moreover,
significant correlations were evident within the spectral features as well as
within the temporal features, but there was little relationship between these
measures. Using a discrete feature, 'the number of pulses in the phee call', a
discriminant function was able to correctly classify the number of pulses in the 
calls well above chance based solely on the acoustic structure of the call's
first pulse. Together, these data suggest that a vocal motor plan for the
complete call structure is established at call onset. These findings provide a
key insight into the mechanisms underlying vocal production in nonhuman primates.

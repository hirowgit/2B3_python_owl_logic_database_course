The surface forces apparatus and atomic force microscope were used to study the
effects of lipid composition and concentrations of myelin basic protein (MBP) on 
the structure of model lipid bilayers, as well as the interaction forces and
adhesion between them. The lipid bilayers had a lipid composition characteristic 
of the cytoplasmic leaflets of myelin from "normal" (healthy) and "disease-like" 
[experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE)] animals. They showed significant 
differences in the adsorption mechanism of MBP. MBP adsorbs on normal bilayers to
form a compact film (3-4 nm) with strong intermembrane adhesion (∼0.36 mJ/m(2)), 
in contrast to its formation of thicker (7-8 nm) swelled films with weaker
intermembrane adhesion (∼0.13 mJ/m(2)) on EAE bilayers. MBP preferentially
adsorbs to liquid-disordered submicron domains within the lipid membranes,
attributed to hydrophobic attractions. These results show a direct connection
between the lipid composition of membranes and membrane-protein adsorption
mechanisms that affects intermembrane spacing and adhesion and has direct
implications for demyelinating diseases.

This study aimed to investigate the effect of estrogen withdrawal on bone tissue 
in adult female marmoset monkeys. In a 1-year follow-up study we used
quantitative computer tomography to measure total bone mineral density (BMD) of
the proximal tibia and the second-last lumbar vertebral body (L5/L6) before and
1, 3, 6, and 12 months after ovariectomy. Body mass did not significantly change 
during the 1-year observation period. However, a significant decline of total BMD
after ovariectomy was observed in the proximal tibia but not in L5/L6. In
addition, regression analysis showed a significant positive relationship between 
BMD and body mass in both tibia and L5/L6. The results of our study support the
idea that ovariectomized marmoset monkeys may serve as a model to investigate
bone loss related to decline of estrogen production.

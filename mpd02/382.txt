Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating, autoimmune disease of the central
nervous system. While work has focused on myelin and axon loss in MS, less is
known about mechanisms underlying synaptic changes. Using postmortem human MS
tissue, a preclinical nonhuman primate model of MS, and two rodent models of
demyelinating disease, we investigated synapse changes in the visual system.
Similar to other neurodegenerative diseases, microglial synaptic engulfment and
profound synapse loss were observed. In mice, synapse loss occurred independently
of local demyelination and neuronal degeneration but coincided with gliosis and
increased complement component C3, but not C1q, at synapses. Viral overexpression
of the complement inhibitor Crry at C3-bound synapses decreased microglial
engulfment of synapses and protected visual function. These results indicate that
microglia eliminate synapses through the alternative complement cascade in
demyelinating disease and identify a strategy to prevent synapse loss that may be
broadly applicable to other neurodegenerative diseases. VIDEO ABSTRACT.

Thyroid glands from 7 marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) of different age groups
(newborn, 2 weeks, 2, 7, 8 and 11 months, and 8 years) were grown as organ
culture according to Trowell at the medium/air interphase for 3 to 30 days. The
morphology of thyroid tissue was well preserved until the end of the culture
period. Necroses were only occasionally seen in connective tissue. In contrast to
the in vivo situation, the number of lysosome-like inclusions changed
considerably and cell-cell contacts became loose. After the addition of TSH the
number of apical microvilli, apical granules and coated vesicles rose. The basal 
surface of follicle cells enlarged due to the formation of processes or ridges
and invaginations. Mitosis could be observed. These findings show that, using the
Trowell culture technique, thyroid tissue can be grown for up to 4 weeks without 
showing distinct changes in its morphology. Its responsiveness to the application
of TSH is maintained in vitro. Hence, this technique is suitable also for
long-term endocrinological, pharmacological and toxicological investigations.

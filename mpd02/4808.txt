Regulation of oestrogen-induced LH release in male and female marmoset monkeys
(Callithrix jacchus).

Hodges JK.

The positive-feedback action of oestradiol-17 beta on LH release was studied in
gonadectomized male and female and intact male marmoset monkeys. Positive
feedback was observed in normal intact males in response to a single subcutaneous
injection of 35 micrograms oestradiol benzoate. The sustained elevation in
oestradiol-17 beta levels achieved by the injections resulted in a marked
suppression of circulating testosterone concentrations. Subcutaneous injections
(0.5 mg/injection) of testosterone or dihydrotestosterone to gonadectomized males
and females immediately following and 8 h after oestradiol benzoate failed to
inhibit positive feedback. Similar treatment with progesterone (1.0 mg/injection)
tended to standardize both positive and negative components of the feedback
response. In contrast, progesterone implants (achieving progesterone
concentrations similar to those obtained with the injections), maintained during 
and for 8 days before the oestradiol benzoate treatment, effectively inhibited
positive feedback. LH responses to the various treatments were similar in
gonadectomized males and females. These data suggest a relative unimportance of
testicular secretions in suppressing oestrogen-induced LH release in the adult
marmoset and indicate similarities between the control of positive feedback in
male and female primates.

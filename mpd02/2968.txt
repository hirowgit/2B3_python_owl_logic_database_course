The authors analyze the effects of enrichment devices on the behavior of common
marmoset female pairs, and determine which aspects of these devices are more
likely to elicit explorative behaviors, and how their presence affects aggressive
and stress-related behaviors. The results support the use of enrichment devices
for captive primates and show that in marmosets, their effectiveness strongly
depends on location within the enclosure and the presence of hidden food.

The hormone relaxin (RLX) is generally present in the serum of humans and
primates as a heterodimer, though some unprocessed prohormone may also be
present. In order to test whether this proRLX is biologically relevant for human 
or primate physiology, recombinant marmoset monkey proRLX was synthesized in a
baculovirus-infected cell system and tested in different bioassays. Marmoset
proRLX is >70% identical to human H2 proRLX, especially in the so-called
receptor-binding region of the B-peptide. The bioassay systems used were (a) cAMP
production by human endometrial stromal cells and (b) cAMP production by the
human monocyte cell line THP-1. In both bioassay systems recombinant proRLX
showed comparable EC(50) values to pure porcine heterodimeric relaxin (porcine
relaxin, 1.5-2.0 nM; marmoset prorelaxin 4.0-5.0 nM). Additionally, recombinant
marmoset prorelaxin was shown to stimulate steroidogenesis in primary cultures of
marmoset ovarian theca cells, though with a lower apparent activity than porcine 
relaxin. It thus appears that precursor processing of human or primate relaxin is
not an essential prerequisite for the acquisition of bioactivity, as it is for
the closely related hormone insulin, and that circulating prorelaxin is
physiologically relevant.

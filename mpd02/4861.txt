[Autoradiographic studies on the distribution of 14C-piracetam in the simian
brain].

[Article in German]

Ostrowski J, Keil M.

Autoradiography of the brain of the monkey Callithrix jacchus 2 and 6 h after
oral application of 200 mg 14C-piracetam/kg (2-oxo-pyrrolidine-l-acetamide-2-14C)
shows that the drug is preferably concentrated in the cortex of cerebrum and
cerebellum. This specific affinity of piracetam which was observed earlier in dog
and rat is thus confirmed in the primate and seems to be species independent.
Beside the dominant cortical concentration there is a characteristic storage of
piracetam in many nuclei of other brain areas, for instance, nucleus caudatus,
hippocampus, n. anteriores thalami, n. dorsales thalami, corpus geniculatum
laterale and mediale, corpora mamillaria, nucleus supraopticus, substantia grisea
centralis, colliculi superiores and inferiores. Furthermore piracetam is stored
in the blood vessel wall of the brain over 6 h. The hypophysis and pineal body
take up radioactivity intensively.

PROBLEM: We examined the effect of neonatal treatment with a
gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist (antide) on the development of
cell-mediated immunity in male marmosets.
METHOD OF STUDY: Neonatal marmoset twins were treated with either vehicle or
antide, and the proliferative response (PR) of lymphoid tissue to mitogens was
assessed during infancy, the peripubertal period, and adulthood.
RESULTS: Basal proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from
treated peripubertal twins was elevated above control values, but the PR of the
cells to T and B cell mitogens was subnormal. Conversely, PBMC from treated
infants exhibited an enhanced PR to some of the mitogens employed. In vitro
culturing of thymocytes (control or treated) from the three developmental stages 
with either antide or a GnRH agonist increased basal proliferation, but decreased
the PR to mitogens by 60-80%.
CONCLUSION: Neonatal treatment with antide alters development of, but does not
permanently impair, cell-mediated immunity in the marmoset. GnRH appears to
modulate immune responses throughout development in the primate.

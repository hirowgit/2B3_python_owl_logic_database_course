A novel Bifidobacterium strain, MRM 9.3T, was isolated from a faecal sample of a 
baby common marmoset (Callithrixjacchus). Cells were Gram-stain-positive,
non-motile, non-sporulating, non-haemolytic, facultatively anaerobic and fructose
6-phosphate phosphoketolase-positive. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA
genes as well as multilocus sequences (representing hsp60, rpoB, clpC, dnaJ and
dnaG genes) and the core genomes revealed that strain MRM 9.3T exhibited
phylogenetic relatedness to Bifidobacterium myosotis DSM 100196T. Comparative
analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences confirmed the phylogenetic results showing
the highest gene sequence identity with strain B.ifidobacterium myosotis DSM
100196T (95.6 %). The average nucleotide identity, amino acid average identity
and in silico DNA-DNA hybridization values between MRM 9.3T and DSM 100196T were 
79.9, 72.1 and 28.5 %, respectively. Phenotypic and genotypic features clearly
showed that the strain MRM 9.3T represents a novel species, for which the name
Bifidobacterium jacchi sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is MRM 9.3T (=DSM
103362T =JCM 31788T).

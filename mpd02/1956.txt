Soy isoflavones are phytoestrogens with potential hormonal activity due to their 
similar chemical structure to 17-Î²-estradiol. The increasing availability of soy 
isoflavones throughout the food supply and through use of supplements has
prompted extensive research on biological benefits to humans in chronic disease
prevention and health maintenance. While much of this research has focused on
adult populations, infants fed soy protein based infant formulas are exposed to
substantial levels of soy isoflavones, even when compared to adult populations
that consume a higher quantity of soy-based foods. Infant exposure, through soy
formula, primarily occurs from birth to one year of life, a stage of development 
that is particularly sensitive to dietary and environmental compounds. This has
led investigators to study the potential hormonal effects of soy isoflavones on
later reproductive health outcomes. Such studies have included minimal human data
with the large majority of studies using animal models. This review discusses key
aspects of the current human and animal studies and identifies critical areas to 
be investigated as there is no clear consensus in this research field.

An involvement of acetylcholine in object discrimination learning and memory in
the marmoset.

Ridley RM, Bowes PM, Baker HF, Crow TJ.

Five marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) were tested, using a Wisconsin General Test
Apparatus, on a series of junk object visual discrimination tasks, including new 
learning, 24-hr reversal and 24-hr retention. The effects of administering the
cholinergic receptor blocking agent, scopolamine either just before or
immediately after the new learning task, or just before the 24-hr reversal and
retention tasks, were assessed. Results suggest that scopolamine impairs new
learning and impairs the encoding of new information in long term memory. Some
evidence of a mild retrieval deficit under scopolamine was also seen, while
state-dependent effects were not apparent.

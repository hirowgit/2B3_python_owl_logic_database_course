We observed a potentially misinterpretable polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
amplification product generated with standard primers used to detect the major
breakpoint region (mbr) of chromosomal translocation t(14;18). This unexpected
phenomenon was initially detected during attempts to transform follicular
lymphomas in vitro with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Additional studies were
performed using the EBV-producing cell line MCUV5, cell lines from
EBV-transformed normal B-lymphocytes, and an excised lymph node from a patient
with documented EBV-associated infectious mononucleosis. These samples
consistently produced a 167-base pair product, which was indistinguishable from a
t(14;18) lymphoma product when viewed on ethidium bromide-stained gels. Through
DNA sequencing and gene bank analysis, the product was identified as a portion of
the EBV genome. A mbr-specific 20-base oligonucleotide probe was able to
discriminate between true translocations and the EBV-related amplifications.
These results underscore the importance of employing a specific detection system,
and comprehensively screening primers when working with PCR.

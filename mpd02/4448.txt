Administration of L-DOPA plus carbidopa, or the D-2 agonist (+)-PHNO, to
MPTP-treated common marmosets caused motor hyperactivity and a reversal of the
parkinsonian syndrome. In contrast, administration of the putative D-1 agonist
SKF 38393 was without effect on movement or motor disability. The subsequent
administration of another putative selective D-1 partial agonist CY 208-243
produced a dose-related improvement in motor activity and reversal of
parkinsonian motor deficits in MPTP-treated animals. The effect of CY 208-243 was
inhibited by pretreatment with the D-1 antagonist SCH 23390 and, to a lesser
extent, by the D-2 antagonist sulpiride. In another group of normal drug naive
marmosets, the administration of CY 208-243 produced only a small increase in
motor activity. Following treatment with MPTP and without other drug
administration, administration of CY 208-243 produced a marked reversal of motor 
deficits and locomotor hyperactivity. Thus, CY 208-243, suggested to be a partial
D-1 agonist exhibits antiparkinsonian activity in MPTP-treated marmosets which
does not require prior or concurrent exposure to D-2 agonists.

To compare the identity of the primary structure of drug-metabolizing cytochrome 
P450 between miniature pigs and humans, two cDNA clones, coding for miniature pig
CYP2D21 and CYP3A22, were isolated. The deduced amino acid sequences of CYP2D21
and CYP3A22 were 78.3 and 75.0% identical to human CYP2D6 and CYP3A4,
respectively. These values were nearly the same as those of bovine, dog, and some
rodent isoforms, and 12.2 to 18.4% lower than those of nonhuman primates such as 
cynomolgus monkeys, Japanese monkey, and marmosets. These data indicate that
miniature pig P450s are genetically not so close as monkey P450s to human P450s
as previously expected. The recombinant CYP2D21 enzyme, however, showed bufuralol
1'-hydroxylase activity, suggesting that miniature pig CYP2D21 is capable of
metabolizing some of the same substrates associated with human CYP2D6 despite its
low identity to human counterparts.

RATIONALE: Motivational effects of psychotropic drugs may contribute to their
therapeutic profile and progressive ratio (PR) schedules provide a method of
measuring these effects in animals.
OBJECTIVE: Determine effects of selected antipsychotic, psychotomimetic,
anxiolytic and antidepressant drugs on PR performance in common marmosets.
METHOD: Marmosets were trained to lever press for banana milkshake reinforcement 
using a PR schedule, in which the number of lever presses to achieve successive
reinforcements increased by one until responding ceased (breakpoint).
RESULTS: Clozapine administered intramuscularly (0.01-2 mg/kg IM; 30 min
pretreatment time (ptt) or by oral gavage (0.1-4 mg/kg PO; 60 min ptt)
significantly increased the breakpoint. Independent tests of fluid consumption
failed to show enhanced fluid intake after clozapine pretreatment, suggesting
this effect was not due to drug induced polydipsia. Neither haloperidol
(0.005-0.1 mg/kg PO; 60 min ptt) nor risperidone (0.0025-0.05 mg/kg PO; 60 min
ptt) altered breakpoint. Olanzapine (0.01-1 mg/kg PO; 60 min ptt) significantly
enhanced the breakpoint at 0.05 mg/kg PO, but the effect was not robust.
Amphetamine (0.2-2 mg/kg SC; 30 min ptt) significantly reduced the breakpoint at 
2 mg/kg and fluoxetine (0.1-1 mg/kg PO; 60 min ptt) was without effect. Diazepam 
significantly increased the breakpoint at 0.5 mg/kg PO. Drug-induced polydipsia
might play a role in this response as independent tests showed increased fluid
consumption following diazepam.
CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that, unlike other antipsychotics,
clozapine over a wide dose range increased the motivational state of marmosets to
respond for banana milkshake. This motivational aspect of clozapine's actions may
contribute to its unique clinical profile and the PR procedure may provide a
method for detecting novel antipsychotics with a clozapine-like profile.

The ability of strains of the B. fragilis group, isolated from the oral cavity
and intestine of marmosets, to produce bacteriorin-like substances in solid
medium, in terms of auto-, iso- and heteroantagonism, was evaluated. Antagonistic
activity was exhibited by 52% of the intestinal strains, 3 of which showed
autoantagonistic activity. Three out of 9 oral strains isolated, tested against
themselves, showed simultaneous isoantagonism to 4 indicator strains; but not
autoantagonism. The same 9 oral strains, when tested against 16 reference
strains, revealed interspecific activity only against 2 Gram-positive
microorganisms. Higher activity, evaluated by the size of the inhibition halo,
was observed in BHI-S agar, and greatest inhibition was obtained after 72 h of
incubation.

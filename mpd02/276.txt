Recent success in identifying gene-regulatory elements in the context of
recombinant adeno-associated virus vectors has enabled cell-type-restricted gene 
expression. However, within the cerebral cortex these tools are largely limited
to broad classes of neurons. To overcome this limitation, we developed a strategy
that led to the identification of multiple new enhancers to target functionally
distinct neuronal subtypes. By investigating the regulatory landscape of the
disease gene Scn1a, we discovered enhancers selective for parvalbumin (PV) and
vasoactive intestinal peptide-expressing interneurons. Demonstrating the
functional utility of these elements, we show that the PV-specific enhancer
allowed for the selective targeting and manipulation of these neurons across
vertebrate species, including humans. Finally, we demonstrate that our selection 
method is generalizable and characterizes additional PV-specific enhancers with
exquisite specificity within distinct brain regions. Altogether, these viral
tools can be used for cell-type-specific circuit manipulation and hold
considerable promise for use in therapeutic interventions.

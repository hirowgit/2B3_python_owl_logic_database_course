The effects of the selective and reversible MAOB inhibitor Ro19-6327 on
parkinsonism in common marmosets, induced by MPTP were studied. Combined
administration of Ro19-6327 with benserazide/levodopa potentiated the effects of 
levodopa to reverse akinesia. In a microdialysis study, the administration of
Ro19-6327 was found to minimize the increase in metabolites of dopamine (DA)
following injection of levodopa. These results suggest that Ro19-6327 suppresses 
the metabolism of DA, resulting in increased effects of levodopa on parkinsonism 
induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). Thus, Ro19-6327
should be useful in the treatment of patients with Parkinson's disease.

The parameters of colon microbiocenosis were evaluated in healthy animals
belonging to 6 species of marmosets; its disorders typical of patients with

young monkeys was characterized. The study demonstrated multiple similarities of 
the microflora of monkeys and humans, including small children. A preclinical

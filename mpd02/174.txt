Genetic modification of nonhuman primate (NHP) zygotes is a useful method for the
development of NHP models of human diseases. This review summarizes the recent
advances in the development of assisted reproductive and genetic manipulation
techniques in NHP, providing the basis for the generation of genetically modified
NHP disease models. In this study, we review assisted reproductive techniques,
including ovarian stimulation, in vitro maturation of oocytes, in vitro
fertilization, embryo culture, embryo transfer, and intracytoplasmic sperm
injection protocols in marmosets. Furthermore, we review genetic manipulation
techniques, including transgenic strategies, target gene knock-out and knock-in
using gene editing protocols, and newly developed gene-editing approaches that
may potentially impact the production of genetically manipulated NHP models. We
further discuss the progress of assisted reproductive and genetic manipulation
techniques in NHP; future prospects on genetically modified NHP models for
biomedical research are also highlighted.

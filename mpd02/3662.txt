Colour vision in primates is mediated by cone opponent ganglion cells in the
retina, whose axons project to the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus in the
visual thalamus. It has long been assumed that cone opponent ganglion cells
project to the parvocellular layers of the geniculate. Here, we examine the role 
of a third subdivision of the geniculocortical pathway: the interlaminar or
koniocellular geniculate relay cells. We made extracellular recordings in the
dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus of the common marmoset Callithrix jacchus, a
New World monkey in which the interlaminar cells are well segregated from the
parvocellular layers. We found that one group of colour opponent cells, the
blue-on cells, was largely segregated to the interlaminar zone. This segregation 
was common to dichromatic ('red-green colour-blind') and trichromatic marmosets. 
The result calls into question the traditional notion that all colour information
passes through the parvocellular division of the retino-geniculo-cortical pathway
in primates.

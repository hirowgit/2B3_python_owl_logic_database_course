Determining appropriate feeding regimes has important welfare implications for
cap-tive primates. This study examined the preference of food bowl heights in 6
pairs of common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) housed in a 2-tier cage system.
Given that marmosets are arboreal and spend most of their time in the upper half 
of their cages, we predicted that the marmosets would prefer a food bowl
positioned at the top of the cage over one positioned at the bottom. We further
predicted that this would be more apparent for the marmosets housed in lower tier
than upper tier cages. Given a choice regarding where to feed, marmosets did
prefer the top bowl to the bottom bowl; how-ever, when only 1 food bowl was
presented, its position had no significant effect on the marmosets' feeding
behavior. In addition, contrary to the prediction, there were few differences in 
the marmosets' feeding behavior in the upper and lower tier cages. Feeding the
marmosets in a bowl at the bottom of their cage did not result in greater cage
use. On the basis of this study, we recommend positioning captive marmosets' food
bowls high in the cage.

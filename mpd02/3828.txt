Data from field studies of three Callithrix species, C. flaviceps, C. intermedia,
and C. jacchus, are considered in an attempt to characterize group dynamics in
this genus. The three groups considered in detail contrast significantly in many 
behavioral (mating system, ranging behavior, activity patterns) and ecological
(zoogeography, habitat, diet) variables. Despite this, all three groups are
highly similar in a number of characteristics, including relatively large size,
high reproductive output, and low rates of migration. The evidence suggests that 
Callithrix groups may frequently encompass three generations and are
characterized by a high degree of both stability and relatedness between group
members. © 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

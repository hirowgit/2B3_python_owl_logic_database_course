The aerial/terrestrial scan and glance behaviors of 20 captive adult black
tufted-ear marmosets (Callithrix penicillata), kept undisturbed in their own
familiar social environments, were assessed at 07:00, 09:00, 11:00, 13:00 and
15:00 h, as little is known on the temporal organization of their vigilance
repertoire, particularly under normal social and stress-free conditions. For each
time point, four 20-min observation sessions were held. Although general high
vigilance rates were observed, significantly more time was spent scanning the
upper part of the home-cage, particularly during the earliest and latest hours of
the day. Significantly higher terrestrial than aerial glance frequencies were
also seen, yet both remained constant throughout the day. Therefore, the observed
pattern not only varied significantly according to the specific vigilance
behavior and time of day, but also seemed associated with eco-physiological
factors, such as the search/intake of food, sleep site selection and higher risk 
of air-born threats.

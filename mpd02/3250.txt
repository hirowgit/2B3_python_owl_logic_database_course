A New World monkey, the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), will be used as a
preclinical animal model to study the feasibility of cell and gene therapy
targeting immunological and hematological disorders. For elucidating the
immunogenetic background of common marmoset to further studies, in the present
study, polymorphisms of MHC-DRB genes in this species were examined. Twenty-one
Caja-DRB exon 2 alleles, including seven new ones, were detected by means of
subcloning and the polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation
polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) methods followed by nucleotide sequencing. Based on the
alignment of these allele sequences, we designed two pairs of specific primers
and established a PCR-SSCP method for DNA-based histocompatibility typing of the 
common marmoset. According to the family segregation data and phylogenetic
analyses, we presumed that Caja-DRB alleles could be classified into five
different loci. Southern blotting analysis also supported the existence of
multiple DRB loci. The patterns of nucleotide substitutions suggests that
positive selection operates in the antigen-recognition sites of Caja-DRB genes.

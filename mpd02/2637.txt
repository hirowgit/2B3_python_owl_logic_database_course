occ1 is a gene whose expression is particularly abundant in neurons in the
macaque primary visual cortex (V1). In the present study, we report that the
expression of occ1 mRNA in the macaque neocortex can be classified into two
modes. The first mode is associated with excitatory neurons distributed in the
major thalamocortical recipient layers that exhibit strong cytochrome oxidase
activity. This is highly prominent in V1. The second mode is associated with
parvalbumin-positive GABAergic interneurons and is distributed across the macaque
neocortex. In V1, monocular deprivation showed that occ1 mRNA expression in
excitatory neurons was markedly dependent on afferent activity, whereas that in
GABAergic interneurons was not. Cross-species comparison showed specific
differences in expression. In marmosets, a strong expression was observed in V1
similarly to macaques. The occ1 mRNA expression, however, was generally weak in
the mouse neocortex. In rabbit and ferret cortices, the strong expression was
observed only in GABAergic interneurons. We conclude that activity-dependent occ1
mRNA expression in the excitatory neurons of V1 was caused by a novel mechanism
acquired by primates after their separation from other lineages.

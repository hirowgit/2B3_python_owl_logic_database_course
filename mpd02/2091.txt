To facilitate common marmoset brain research, we produced a DNA microarray with
7557 probe sets derived from the common marmoset brain. Gene expression profiles 
in the frontal lobe, hippocampus, cerebellum and amygdaloid nucleus were then
analyzed and the top 100 probe sets expressed in each structure were compared.
The three lists for the frontal lobe, hippocampus and amygdaloid nucleus were
very similar but the probe sets for the cerebellum demonstrated specific
differences. Some of the genes specifically expressed in cerebellum were analyzed
by real-time quantitative PCR to verify the DNA microarray results. Of examined
genes, 5 showed extremely strong expression in cerebellum in comparison with the 
other structures. The results of real-time quantitative PCR were well consistent 
with the microarray findings, validating our newly developed DNA microarray as a 
useful tool for brain research with the common marmoset.

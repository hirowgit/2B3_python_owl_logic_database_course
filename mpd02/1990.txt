A series of AMPA receptor positive allosteric modulators has been optimized from 
poorly penetrant leads to identify molecules with excellent preclinical
pharmacokinetics and CNS penetration. These discoveries led to 17i, a potent,
efficacious CNS penetrant molecule with an excellent pharmacokinetic profile
across preclinical species, which is well tolerated and is also orally
bioavailable in humans.

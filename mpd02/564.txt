When offspring share a womb, interactions among fetuses can impart lasting
impressions on phenotypic outcomes. Such intrauterine interactions often are
mediated by sex steroids (estrogens and androgens) produced by the developing
fetuses. In many mammals, intrauterine interactions between brothers and sisters 
lead to masculinization of females, which can induce fitness consequences. Many
litter-bearing primates, though, seem to escape androgen-mediated litter effects,
begging why? Here, we investigated how the sex composition (i.e., same- or
mixed-sex) of litters influences perinatal outcomes in the common marmoset monkey
(Callithrix jacchus), using a combination of physiological, morphological, and
behavioural assays. We hypothesized that androgens from male fetuses would
mediate developmental differences across litter types. We found that newborns
(24-36â€‰hours old) from same- and mixed-sex litters were indistinguishable by
urinary androgen profiles, birth weights, morphometrics, and behaviour. However, 
monkeys born into same- and mixed-sex litters exhibited subtle morphological and 
neurobehavioral differences later in the perinatal period, independent of their
androgen profiles. Our findings suggest that while androgens from male fetuses
likely do not organize their siblings' phenotypes, perinatal stimuli may initiate
divergent developmental trajectories among siblings, which, in turn, promotes
inter-individual variability within families.

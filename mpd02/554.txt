Genome editing technology greatly facilitates the genetic modification of various
cells and animals. The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a small non-human
primate which exhibits high reproductive efficiency, is a widely used animal
model in biomedical research. Developing genome editing techniques in the common 
marmoset will further enhance its utility. Here, we report the successful
establishment of a knock-in (KI) method for marmoset embryonic stem cells (ESCs),
which is based on the CRISPR-Cas9 system. The use of CRISPR-Cas9, mediated by
homologous recombination (HR), enhanced the KI efficiency in marmoset ESCs.
Furthermore, we succeeded in performing KI in early-stage marmoset embryos. In
the course of the experiments, we found that HR in the marmoset ESCs is innately 
highly efficient. This suggested that the marmoset possesses a repair mechanism
for DNA double-strand breaks. The current study will facilitate the generation of
genetically modified marmosets and gene function analysis in the marmoset.

Stereo-pair three-dimensional imaging of microvascular architecture in primate
dental tissues.

Lee D, Sims MR, Sampson WJ, Dreyer CW.

The morphology of microvascular beds in dental tissues is poorly documented at
the ultrastructural level. SEM stereo-pair imaging of microcorrosion casts
reveals the markedly contrasting vascular architecture and capillary anastomoses 
within the nasopalatine foramen, soft palate and gingival regions of the
marmoset. This primate was studied as an analogue for man to further our
knowledge of periodontal anatomy and function.

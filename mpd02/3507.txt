Deficiency of neuronal growth inhibitory factor (GIF) and abnormalities in zinc
homeostasis have been suggested to play a role in the neuropathogenesis of
Alzheimer's disease. We report here that embryonic chick cerebral cell cultures
zinc and copper containing GIF in the presence of marmoset hippocampal extract
reduces significantly and concentration dependently mitochondrial succinate
dehydrogenase activity (MTT) and cell mass. In contrast, no indications could be 
found that GIF affected neural retina cell cultures. Our results suggest that the
observed effects of GIF are not elicited by zinc.

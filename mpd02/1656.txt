We have developed a multi variate analysis of social communication behavior which
allows for discriminating the emotional state of an agent interacting with other 
agents (Bouquet method). Domestic chick or common marmoset was reared under
socially isolated conditions, later tested for its development of communication
behavior with peers by Bouquet, and compared with that of animals reared under
grouping conditions. We found the existence of high sensitive period for social
interaction, given less experience, developing less affiliated behavior. From
chick model, a couple of neuronal difference was observed between two groups,
amygdale core central cell size, MRI volumetric measure in mesolimbic area, and
gene expression patter including brain type tryptophan hydroxylase in nucleus
accumbens. The isolated chick behavior changed better to be socially affiliated
by taking SSRI/SNRI or Ubiquinol (the reduced form of CoQ10) together with social
interaction experience after the sensitive period. Finally, we could discriminate
the behavior of Asperger syndrome children (n = 7) from that of the typically
developed siblings (n = 6) during the clinical interview by applying Bouquet
method.

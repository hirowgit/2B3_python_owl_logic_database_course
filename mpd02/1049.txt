Recordings of local field potential (LFP) in the visual cortex can show rhythmic 
activity at gamma frequencies (30-100 Hz). While the gamma rhythms in the primary
visual cortex have been well studied, the structural and functional
characteristics of gamma rhythms in extrastriate visual cortex are less clear.
Here, we studied the spatial distribution and functional specificity of gamma
rhythms in extrastriate middle temporal (MT) area of visual cortex in marmoset
monkeys. We found that moving gratings induced narrowband gamma rhythms across
cortical layers that were coherent across much of area MT. Moving dot fields
instead induced a broadband increase in LFP in middle and upper layers, with
weaker narrowband gamma rhythms in deeper layers. The stimulus dependence of LFP 
response in middle and upper layers of area MT appears to reflect the presence
(gratings) or absence (dot fields and other textures) of strongly oriented
contours. Our results suggest that gamma rhythms in these layers are propagated
from earlier visual cortex, while those in the deeper layers may emerge in area
MT.

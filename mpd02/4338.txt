1. The effect of dietary change on common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus)
exhibiting high in vitro erythrocyte haemolysis, skin lesions and alopecia was
investigated. 2. The experimental diet was low in lipid, high in vitamin E and
was devoid of n-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids. 3. There were
significant increases in the concentrations of plasma alpha-tocopherol (vitamin
E) (P less than 0.05), all-trans retinol (vitamin A) (P less than 0.001) and
total lipid (P less than 0.025), and a reduction in fibrinogen (P less than 0.02)
concentration and neutrophil count (P less than 0.02). 4. Moreover, the mean in
vitro erythrocyte haemolysis declined from an initial value of 64% to less than
2%, and there was a regression of skin lesions and alopecia with complete fur
regrowth. 5. The amelioration of the conditions appear to be due to high
circulating vitamin E which provided protection against oxidative stress, and the
correction of membrane n-6:n-3 balance.

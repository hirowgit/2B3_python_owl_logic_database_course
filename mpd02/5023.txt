1. It has been possible to introduce yellow fever virus into the small Brazilian 
monkeys, Callithrix albicollis and Leontocebus ursulus, by the bites of infected 
mosquitoes and to carry the virus through a series of four passages in each
species and back to rhesus monkeys by the bites of Stegomyia mosquitoes fed on
the last marmoset of each series. 2. Five specimens of L. ursulus were used. Four
developed fever, and all died during the experiments. At least two showed liver
necroses comparable to those found in human beings and rhesus monkeys that died
of yellow fever. 3. Twenty specimens of C. albicollis were used. Very few showed 
a temperature reaction following the introduction of virus. Of those that died,
none had lesions typical of yellow fever as seen in certain other species of
monkeys and in humans. 4. The convalescent serum from each of five C. albicollis 
protected a rhesus monkey against yellow fever virus, but the serum from a normal
marmoset of the same species was found to be non-protective.

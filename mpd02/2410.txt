Epstein Barr Virus (EBV), is associated with an increasing number of lymphoid and
epithelial malignancies. Among the genes expressed by EBV during latency, LMP1
plays a key role for growth transformation and immortalization of B lymphocytes. 
We have previously shown that antisense oligonucleotides (ONs) directed to LMP1
mRNA, effectively suppressed LMP1 gene expression and substantially reduced
proliferation of the infected cells. The use of antisense phosphodiester
oligonucleotides as therapeutic agents is limited by inefficient cellular uptake 
and intracellular transport to the target mRNA. We tested the ability of three
cationic carriers internalized by different pathways, to increase the delivery of
anti-LMP1-ON to their site of action in EBV-infected B lymphocytes. We report
here that liposomes, dendrimers or transferrin-polylysine-conjugated ON were
internalized by the cells at an extent several fold higher than that of the naked
oligomers. However, only the delivery system exploiting the transferrin receptor 
pathway of internalization, was able to vectorize biologically active antisense
LMP1-ON.

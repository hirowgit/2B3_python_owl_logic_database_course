This study tests the regenerative capability of condylar cartilage by examining
repair of full-thickness articular surface defects in a primate model. The wounds
were reconstituted within 6 months with tissue identical to the remaining
condylar structure, and the reformed articular surface was maintained intact up
to 1 year postinjury.

T cells transformed by Herpesvirus saimiri express seven viral U-rich noncoding
RNAs of unknown function called HSURs. We noted that conserved sequences in HSURs
1 and 2 constitute potential binding sites for three host-cell microRNAs
(miRNAs). Coimmunoprecipitation experiments confirmed that HSURs 1 and 2 interact
with the predicted miRNAs in virally transformed T cells. The abundance of one of
these miRNAs, miR-27, is dramatically lowered in transformed cells, with
consequent effects on the expression of miR-27 target genes. Transient knockdown 
and ectopic expression of HSUR 1 demonstrate that it directs degradation of
mature miR-27 in a sequence-specific and binding-dependent manner. This viral
strategy illustrates use of a ncRNA to manipulate host-cell gene expression via
the miRNA pathway.

Hemispheric fine-grain maps of primary auditory cortex (AI) were derived from
microelectrode penetrations in the temporal gyrus of the common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus) to 1) compare the functional organization of AI in the
marmoset with other mammalian species and 2) compare the right and left AI maps
in individual monkeys. Frequency receptive fields (FRFs) were recorded with pure 
tones. Five FRF parameters were analyzed: characteristic frequency, threshold,
sharpness of tuning 10 dB and 40 dB above threshold, and minimum response
latency. The present study confirms that the functional organization of AI is
characterized by a robust tonotopic frequency gradient overlaid with spatially
clustered distributions of other FRF parameters. Globally, this functional
organization of AI in the common marmoset is similar to that in other mammalian
species. With respect to within-subject hemispheric comparisons of the five FRF
parameters, a coherent pattern of asymmetry is not evident in marmoset AI. The
overall results indicate that the basic functional organization between
hemispheres is similar but not identical.

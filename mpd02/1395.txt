Small RNAs mediate gene silencing by binding Argonaute/Piwi proteins to regulate 
target RNAs. Here, we describe small RNA profiling of the adult testes of
Callithrix jacchus, the common marmoset. The most abundant class of small RNAs in
the adult testis was piRNAs, although 353 novel miRNAs but few endo-siRNAs were
also identified. MARWI, a marmoset homolog of mouse MIWI and a very abundant PIWI
in adult testes, associates with piRNAs that show characteristics of mouse
pachytene piRNAs. As in other mammals, most marmoset piRNAs are derived from
conserved clustered regions in the genome, which are annotated as intergenic
regions. However, unlike in mice, marmoset piRNA clusters are also found on the X
chromosome, suggesting escape from meiotic sex chromosome inactivation by the
X-linked clusters. Some of the piRNA clusters identified contain
antisense-orientated pseudogenes, suggesting the possibility that
pseudogene-derived piRNAs may regulate parental functional protein-coding genes. 
More piRNAs map to transposable element (TE) subfamilies when they have copies in
piRNA clusters. In addition, the strand bias observed for piRNAs mapped to each
TE subfamily correlates with the polarity of copies inserted in clusters. These
findings suggest that pachytene piRNA clusters determine the abundance and
strand-bias of TE-derived piRNAs, may regulate protein-coding genes via
pseudogene-derived piRNAs, and may even play roles in meiosis in the adult
marmoset testis.

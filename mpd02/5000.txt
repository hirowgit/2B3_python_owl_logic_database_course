Marrow Chimerism in Marmosets.

Benirschke K, Anderson JM, Brownhill LE.

In the femoral marrow of three adult marmosets, two male Callithrix jacchus and
one female Leontocebus rosalia, a number of opposite-sexed metaphases were found.
It is inferred that this chimeric state resulted from intrauterine placental
anastomoses between heterosexual twins. The lack of the freemartin effect in
connection with this chimerism is discussed, and the structural nature of the Y
chromosome in the Callithricidae is described.

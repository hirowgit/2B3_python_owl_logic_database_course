Unlike hyaline cartilage, mandibular condylar cartilage can respond to injury by 
complete healing. We have used the reparative potential of mandibular cartilage
to promote repair of defects in a hyaline cartilage joint surface. In 12 adult
marmosets, articular fibrocartilage from the mandibular condyles was transplanted
into full-thickness defects created in the femoral condyles. Additional defects
acted as an ungrafted control group. The grafted defects showed good
incorporation of the transplant with restoration of the articular surface within 
six months. Repair was by proliferation of the fibrocartilaginous graft and
chondrogenesis of hyaline cartilage. The repopulating cells were distributed in a
matrix of maturing collagen and sulphated glycosaminoglycans. Ungrafted control
defects were only partly repaired with fibrous tissue, leaving articular
deficiencies. We conclude that transplanted mandibular fibrocartilage can promote
reconstitution of wounded hyaline cartilage joint surfaces in primates.

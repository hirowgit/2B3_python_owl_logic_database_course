Morphological assessment of testicular maturity in marmosets (Callithrix
jacchus).

Jackson MR, Edmunds JG.

The onset of spermatogenesis in relation to age, bodyweight and testes weight in 
105 marmosets used in safety studies has been reviewed. The histological
recognition of adverse effects on spermatogenesis is an important part of these
studies and this survey indicates that male marmosets should be at least 50 weeks
and preferably 60 weeks of age if an assessment of all stages of spermatogenesis 
is required for safety evaluation.

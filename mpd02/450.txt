Interactions between motor systems and sensory processing are ubiquitous
throughout the animal kingdom and play an important role in many sensorimotor
behaviors, including both human speech and animal vocalization. During vocal
production, the auditory system plays important roles in both encoding feedback
of produced sounds, allowing one to self-monitor for vocal errors, and
simultaneously maintaining sensitivity to the outside acoustic environment.
Supporting these roles is an efferent motor-to-sensory signal known as a
corollary discharge. This review summarizes recent work on the role of such
signaling during vocalization in the marmoset monkey, a nonhuman primate model of
social vocal communication.

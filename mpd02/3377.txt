Effects of beta-blockers (propranolol, arotinolol and nipradilol) and a Ca2+
channel blocker (nicardipine) on oxotremorine-induced tremor were studied in
common marmosets. Generalized tremor was elicited by an intraperitoneal
administration of 0.25 mg/kg oxotremorine. Intensity of the tremor was classified
into 7 degrees, and it was evaluated every 10 min. The total intensity of
oxotremorine-induced tremor for each drug was expressed as "points", which were
the sum of tremor intensity scores evaluated every 10 min up to 190 min following
the administration of oxotremorine. Beta-blockers significantly suppressed the
tremor. On the other hand, the Ca2+ channel blocker exacerbated the tremor.

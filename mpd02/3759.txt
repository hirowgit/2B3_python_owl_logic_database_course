The purpose of the present study was to examine and quantify the functional
consequence of a focal cerebral ischaemic lesion in a primate species, the
marmoset. Following craniotomy and retraction of the frontal and temporal lobes, 
the middle cerebral artery was permanently occluded by means of
electrocoagulation. Three and eight weeks after surgery, various behavioural
tests were used to give a quantifiable measure to the neurological deficits
produced. These tests required the monkeys to reach into tubes for foodbits,
retrieve rewards from the steps of two designs of 'staircases', respond to one of
two simultaneously presented rewarded tubes, remove adhesive labels attached to
their feet, and respond to sensory stimuli. Unilateral motor impairment of the
contralateral forelimb and neglect of contralateral tactile stimuli were seen in 
all subjects, and spatial neglect was also present in some monkeys. Subsequent
histological analysis revealed unilateral cortical damage in all subjects with
varying amounts of injury to the caudate and the putamen in some animals. These
results demonstrate the potential for the use of this species in future
investigations to examine the effect of neuroprotective treatment on functional
outcome after a focal ischaemic insult.

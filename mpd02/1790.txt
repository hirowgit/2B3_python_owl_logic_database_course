Early development of visual behavior was examined in hand-reared (HR) and
parentally reared (PR) common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus). On the day of
birth, most of the marmosets exhibited sensitivity to light and sound: they
closed their eyes in response to light and oriented to the sound sources. The
behavior of tracking moving visual stimuli was exhibited at around 10 days
postnatally in PR marmosets, but the onset of this behavior was delayed to the
age of 16 days in HR marmosets. The delay occurred possibly because of the poor
input of optical flow under the HR environment. The onset age of head-cocking was
about 2 weeks in both groups of marmosets, and the HR marmosets began
head-cocking and visual tracking simultaneously. Both groups of marmosets
exhibited sensitivity to optical approach at the age of around 30 days: the age
to wean and increase independent locomotion. The results suggested that the onset
of motion perception preceded detailed shape and depth perception in marmosets,
and the developmental sequence in marmosets was similar to those in humans and
macaque monkeys. Marmosets appear to be useful animal models to examine
environmental effects on early visual development.

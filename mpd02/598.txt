Animal models that recapitulate the human pathophysiology have been developed as 
useful research tools. Although laboratory mice are widely used, they are
phylogenetically "distant" to humans. New world monkeys, such as the common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) have steadily gained prominence. In this report,
marmosets are explored as an alternate in vivo model to investigate infection and
immunity of Zika virus (ZIKV). Multimodal platforms, including ultrasound and
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), flow cytometry, and multiplex microbead
immunoassays were established to comprehensively decipher immune responses and
pathophysiological outcomes. While ZIKV-infected marmosets had detectable ZIKV
RNA load in various body fluids, animals did not develop any observable lesions
in theirÂ testes and brains as shown by ultrasound and MRI. Immune-phenotyping
detected differences in the numbers of B cells, CD8+ T cells and HLADR+ NK cells 
during the first two weeks of infection. Neutralizing ZIKV-specific antibodies
were elicited to high levels and targeted epitopes in the E protein. This study
presents a one-stop-shop platform to study infection and pathophysiology in
marmosets. While marmoset-specific research tools are being refined, the research
values of these animals present them as a good model for immune-based therapies.

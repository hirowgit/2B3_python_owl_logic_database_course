OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical and physiological effects of intravenous
(IV) alfaxalone alone or in combination with buprenorphine, butorphanol or
tramadol premedication in marmosets.
STUDY DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, blinded, crossover design.
ANIMALS: Nine healthy marmosets (391 ± 48 g, 3.7 ± 2.2 years old).
METHODS: Meloxicam 0.20 mg kg-1 subcutaneously, atropine 0.05 mg kg-1
intramuscularly (IM) and either buprenorphine 20 μg kg-1 IM (BUP-A), butorphanol 
0.2 mg kg-1 IM (BUT-A), tramadol 1.5 mg kg-1 IM (TRA-A) or no additional drug
(control) were administered to all marmosets as premedication. After 1 hour,
anaesthesia was induced with 16 mg kg-1 alfaxalone IV. All animals received all
protocols. The order of protocol allocation was randomized with a minimum 28 day 
wash-out period. During anaesthesia, respiratory and pulse rates, rectal
temperature, haemoglobin oxygen saturation, arterial blood pressure, palpebral
and pedal withdrawal reflexes and degree of muscle relaxation were assessed and
recorded every 5 minutes. Quality of induction and recovery were assessed.
Duration of induction, immobilization and recovery were recorded. Blood samples
were analysed for aspartate aminotransferase, creatine kinase and lactate
dehydrogenase concentrations. The protocols were compared using paired t tests,
Wilcoxon's signed-rank test with Bonferroni's corrections and linear mixed effect
models where appropriate.
RESULTS: Out of nine animals, apnoea was noted in eight animals administered
protocol BUP-A and two animals administered protocol BUT-A. With TRA-A and
control protocols, apnoea was not observed. No other significant differences in
any of the parameters were found; however, low arterial blood pressures and
hypoxia occurred in TRA-A.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Our study employing different premedications 
suggests that the previously published dose of 16 mg kg-1 alfaxalone is too high 
when used with premedication because we found a high incidence of complications
including apnoea (BUP-A), hypotension and hypoxaemia (TRA-A). Appropriate
monitoring and countermeasures are recommended.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is associated with post-transplant lymphoproliferative
disease (PTLD). To determine whether the donor EBV isolate is transmitted to the 
recipient via the allograft and causes PTLD, EBV isolates from four cases of PTLD
in cadaveric heart and/or lung transplant recipients were compared with the donor
isolates by PCR and DNA sequence analysis. Two recipients who were EBV
seronegative at transplantation acquired an EBV isolate indistinguishable from
that of the donor and developed PTLD. In contrast, in two patients who were
seropositive before transplantation, the donor isolate differed from that present
in PTLD of the recipient. The results suggest that the acquisition of donor EBV
is a risk factor for PTLD development in a previously seronegative transplant
recipient.

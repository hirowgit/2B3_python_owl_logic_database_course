[Antiviral activity of panavir in experimental Measles virus infection in cell
cultures].

[Article in Russian]

Markushin SG, Litvin AA.

Antiviral activity of Panavir was studied in a model of experimental infection
due to Morbillivirus in subcultures of cells Vero and B-16. It was shown that at 
multiplicity of the infection (0.001-0.0001 TCD50/cell) Panavir inhibited
reproduction of the virus in concentrations of 12-100 mcg/0.2 ml.

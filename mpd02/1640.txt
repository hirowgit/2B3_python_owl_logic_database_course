The enhanced pre- and postnatal (ePPND) study design has been developed in
response to new scientific knowledge and subsequent guideline changes [ICH M3(R2)
and ICH S6(R1)]. The changes in study design were basically driven by the
experiences obtained during preclinical development of biopharmaceuticals. The
standard ePPND concept does not apply to conventional small molecule
pharmaceuticals. In essence, the ePPND design is a pre- and postnatal development
(PPND) study in which key elements of an embryo-fetal development study are
investigated in newborns and infants rather than in the fetus. The cynomolgus
monkey is the current relevant nonhuman primate model. The ICH S6(R1) guideline
reached step 5 in June 2011 and provides detailed recommendations on various
parameters and the conduct of an ePPND study. This chapter provides working
guidance for monitoring menstrual cycles to generate pregnant animals, ultrasound
monitoring of pregnancy, morphometric measurements of fetuses and newborns, in
vivo skeletal examination, various protocols for evaluation of infants (e.g.,
neurobehavioral assessment, learning and memory test, grip strength, immune
system evaluation) and a comprehensive list of additional infant evaluation
parameters for the cynomolgus monkey.

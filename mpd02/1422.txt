Systems-level identification and analysis of cellular circuits in the brain will 
require the development of whole-brain imaging with single-cell resolution. To
this end, we performed comprehensive chemical screening to develop a whole-brain 
clearing and imaging method, termed CUBIC (clear, unobstructed brain imaging
cocktails and computational analysis). CUBIC is a simple and efficient method
involving the immersion of brain samples in chemical mixtures containing
aminoalcohols, which enables rapid whole-brain imaging with single-photon
excitation microscopy. CUBIC is applicable to multicolor imaging of fluorescent
proteins or immunostained samples in adult brains and is scalable from a primate 
brain to subcellular structures. We also developed a whole-brain cell-nuclear
counterstaining protocol and a computational image analysis pipeline that,
together with CUBIC reagents, enable the visualization and quantification of
neural activities induced by environmental stimulation. CUBIC enables time-course
expression profiling of whole adult brains with single-cell resolution.

The cerebellum is known as the major target regions of methylmercury (MeHg)
toxicity, but the mechanisms are still not fully understood. We studied the
effects of MeHg exposure in the cerebellum of common marmoset (Callithrix
jacchus) using a shotgun proteomic approach with liquid chromatography coupled to
mass spectrometry. A total of 1000 common proteins were identified in all
samples, and 102 proteins were significantly differentially expressed in the
cerebellum of common marmoset with orally dosed MeHg (1.5 mg MeHg/kg body weight 
for 2 weeks) compared with those of the control group. Functional enrichment
analysis and pathway predictions showed that the differentially expressed
proteins were involved in carbohydrate derivative metabolic process, ion
transport including synaptic transmission, cell development, and calcium
signaling pathway. Cellular component enrichment analysis showed that they were
mainly distributed in plasma membrane, excitatory synapse, and synaptic membrane.
These results indicate that synaptic transmission and calcium signaling pathways 
are the core functions affected by MeHg. We found a total of 21 novel proteins
affected by MeHg in synaptic transmission and calcium signaling pathways. DLG4:
(PSD95) and MIR-19A/MIR-19B were found to be potential key targets leading to the
multiple effects of MeHg neurotoxicity. These results show the global effects of 
MeHg on cellular functions and pathways leading to neurological deficits in
common marmoset.

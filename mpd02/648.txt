Experimenters often use images of real objects to simulate interactions between
animal subjects or visual stimuli on a touchscreen to test animal cognition.
However, the degree to which nonhuman animals recognize 2-D images as
representing the corresponding real objects remains debated. The common marmoset 
monkey (Callithrix jacchus) has been described as a species that spontaneously
shows natural behaviors to 2-D images, for example, grasping behaviors to insects
and fear responses to snakes. In this study, we tested 10 monkeys with their
favorite food item (crickets), 2-D images (a photo and videos of a cricket), and 
a 3-D plastic model to reevaluate marmoset's spontaneous responses to 2-D images 
and to explore which artificial visual stimuli can motivate spontaneous
interactions. The monkeys showed grasping behavior to the real cricket and the
3-D plastic model, but to none of the 2-D images. Our experiment suggests that
depth information is the most important factor eliciting predatory behavior from 
the marmosets, and, therefore, a stimulus produced by a 3-D printer could be a
good alternative when a spontaneous interaction or a convincing stimulus is
required. Furthermore, this work serves as a cautionary tale for those using 2-D 
image presentations with marmosets, and perhaps other animal species. (PsycINFO

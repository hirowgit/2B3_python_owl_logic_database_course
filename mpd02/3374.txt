The poor interspecies conservation of the renin-angiotensin system prevents the
use of nonprimate in vivo models to test renin inhibitors. Thus the small
New-World monkey marmoset is used in many instances as a model. However, large
differences between the potencies of renin inhibitors as measured in human and
marmoset plasma were observed. To understand this phenomenon, we cloned marmoset 
renin and angiotensinogen. They were highly homologous to their human
counterparts, except for a six-residue deletion in the marmoset renin propeptide.
Human and marmoset recombinant renins were found in vitro to display comparable
activities, suggesting that the observed differences in plasma apparent affinity 
of inhibitors could be due to different plasma protein binding of the inhibitors.

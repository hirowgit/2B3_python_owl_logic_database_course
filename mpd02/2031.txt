In this study, we infected NOD/Scid/Jak3null mice engrafted human peripheral
blood leukocytes (hu-PBL-NOJ) with measles virus Edmonston B strain (MV-Edm)
expressing hepatitis C virus (HCV) envelope proteins (rMV-E1E2) to evaluate the
immunogenicity as a vaccine candidate. Although human leukocytes could be
isolated from the spleen of mock-infected mice during the 2-weeks experiment, the
proportion of engrafted human leukocytes in mice infected with MV
(10(3)-10(5)pfu) or rMV-E1E2 (10(4)pfu) was decreased. Viral infection of the
splenocytes was confirmed by the development of cytopathic effects (CPEs) in
co-cultures of splenocytes and B95a cells and verified using RT-PCR. Finally,
human antibodies against MV were more frequently observed than E2-specific
antibodies in serum from mice infected with a low dose of virus (MV,
10(0)-10(1)pfu, and rMV-E1E2, 10(1)-10(2)pfu). These results showed the
possibility of hu-PBL-NOJ mice for the evaluation of the immunogenicity of viral 
proteins.

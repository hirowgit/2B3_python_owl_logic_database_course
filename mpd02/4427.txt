A comparative study on the localization of prostatic inhibin peptide was carried 
out by the immunoperoxidase technique in prostates of humans, bonnet and langur
monkeys, marmosets, dogs, and rats. A positive reaction was observed in the
prostatic epithelial cells of humans, in all three species of monkeys, and in the
rat, while the dog prostate did not exhibit any reaction. These observations
indicate a close immunological similarity among human, monkey, and rat prostatic 
inhibin peptides.

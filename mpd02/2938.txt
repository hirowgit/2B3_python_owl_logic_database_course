To reduce the number of animals required for controlled studies of marmoset
oocytes and early embryos, a superovulation protocol was developed for the common
marmoset. Females were given up to 50 i.u./day recombinant human follicle
stimulating hormone (FSH)--(r-hFSH) for 6 days. Ovaries were visualized by a
modified laparoscopic technique and follicular aspiration was performed using a
needle and suction apparatus inserted directly through an otoscope speculum. The 
number of follicles + ovulation points (+/- S.E.) was 2.9 (+/- 0.2) in controls
and 14.1 (+/- 1.6; P < or = 0.001) in the 50 i.u. r-hFSH per day animals.
Oocytes, typically at the germinal vesicle stage at collection, extruded a first 
polar body within 26 hours. In vitro fertilization was performed and embryos
developed to the hatched blastocyst stage (34%). With many high quality oocytes
and the ability to synchronize cycles, the marmoset is a valuable primate model
for examining nuclear reprograming and early embryonic events.

Squalestatin analogues modified at C3 were prepared and evaluated for their
ability to inhibit rat liver microsomal squalene synthase in vitro. While the
4,6-dimethyloctenoate ester group at C6 was maintained, a number of modifications
to the C3 carboxylic acid were well tolerated. However, in the absence of the C6 
ester group, similar modifications to the C3 carboxyl group caused loss of
activity. Selected compounds were evaluated for their ability to inhibit
cholesterol biosynthesis in vivo in rats 1 and 6 h postadministration. Analogues 
of squalestatin 1 (S1) modified at C3 were found to possess a shorter duration of
effect in vivo which is reflected in their substantially reduced ability to lower
serum cholesterol levels in marmosets. Significant cholesterol lowering (up to
62%) for the C3 hydroxymethyl analogue 1b was observed only when this compound
was dosed three times a day for 3 days.

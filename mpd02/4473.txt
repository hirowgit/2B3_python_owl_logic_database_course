Type C RNA retroviral particles have been observed budding from the plasma
membrane of syncytiotrophoblast during a study of embryo implantation in the
common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). These viral particles appear in profusion
at the interface of syncytiotrophoblast with cytotrophoblast. They appear to be a
non-infective, endogenous viral component of the host genome, although the
precise role of the C-type virus in this context is unclear at present. Such
viral particles have been reported previously from studies of human term
placenta; however, this is the first report indicating that expression of viral
particles occurs at the earliest stages of embryo implantation.

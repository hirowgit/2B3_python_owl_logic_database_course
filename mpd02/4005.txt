Myelolipomas occurring simultaneously in the adrenal and liver were found in a
2.7-yr-old, bred female common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). The animal bore
single adrenal and multiple hepatic myelolipomas. The adrenal myelolipoma
consisted of mature adipose cells and focal collections of normal hematopoietic
elements and was unencapsulated. In the liver, the myelolipomas, which were
partially encapsulated, included a large amount of hematopoietic tissue and
adipose cells that resembled normal bone marrow cells in various ways.
Additionally, one of the multiple nodules contained several bony spicules with
osteoblasts. Furthermore, there were invasive figures of hematopoietic cells,
such as myeloblasts, erythroblasts, and megakaryocytes, in the hepatic sinusoids 
around the lesions. Thus, this case has some unusual morphological
characteristics and is the first report, to our knowledge, on multiorganic
myelolipomas in common marmosets.

Motor and sensory preferences were measured for 8 common marmosets (Callithrix
jacchus). Three types of motor function were examined: spontaneous feeding, mouth
use when chewing and visuospatial reaching. Eye preference was used as an index
of sensory lateralization. The marmosets displayed individual preferences for the
performance of the motor tasks, but no group biases were revealed. Correlations
between preferences displayed on the motor tests suggest that one hemisphere may 
control spontaneous feeding and lateralized mouth use while the other controls
visuospatial reaching, but no consistent preference was present. In an eye
preference test, 7 subjects displayed right-eye preferences, suggesting
hemispheric specialisation for this function.

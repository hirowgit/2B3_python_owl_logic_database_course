Recent evidence demonstrates that the pulvinar nuclei play a critical role in
shaping the connectivity and function of the multiple cortical areas they
connect. Surprisingly, however, little is known about the development of this
area, the largest corpus of the thalamic nuclei, which go on to occupy 40% of the
adult thalamus in the human. It was proposed that the nonhuman primate and the
human pulvinar develop according to very different processes, with a greatly
reduced neurogenic period in nonhuman primate compared to human and divergent
origins. In the marmoset monkey, we demonstrate that neurons populating the
pulvinar are generated throughout gestation, suggesting that this aspect of
development is more similar to the human than first predicted. While we were able
to confirm the diencephalic source of pulvinar neurons, we provide new evidence
contesting the presence of an additional niche in the telencephalon. Finally, our
study defines new molecular markers that will simplify future investigations in
the development and evolution of the pulvinar.

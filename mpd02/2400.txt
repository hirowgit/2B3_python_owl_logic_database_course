BACKGROUND: Certain phthalates can impair Leydig cell distribution and
steroidogenesis in the fetal rat in utero, but it is unknown whether similar
effects might occur in the human.
OBJECTIVES: Our aim in this study was to investigate the effects of di(n-butyl)
phthalate (DBP), or its metabolite monobutyl phthalate (MBP), on testosterone
production and Leydig cell aggregation (LCA) in fetal testis explants from the
rat and human, and to compare the results with in vivo findings for DBP-exposed
rats. We also wanted to determine if DBP/MBP affects testosterone production in
vivo in the neonatal male marmoset.
METHODS: Fetal testis explants obtained from the rat [gestation day (GD)19.5] and
from the human (15-19 weeks of gestation) were cultured for 24-48 hr with or
without human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) or 22R-hydroxycholesterol (22R-OH),
and with or without DBP/MBP. Pregnant rats and neonatal male marmosets were dosed
with 500 mg/kg/day DBP or MBP.
RESULTS: Exposure of rats in utero to DBP (500 mg/kg/day) for 48 hr before GD21.5
induced major suppression of intratesticular testosterone levels and cytochrome
P450 side chain cleavage enzyme (P450scc) expression; this short-term treatment
induced LCA, but was less marked than longer term (GD13.5-20.5) DBP treatment. In
vitro, MBP (10(-3) M) did not affect basal or 22R-OH-stimulated testosterone
production by fetal rat testis explants but slightly attenuated hCG-stimulated
steroidogenesis; MBP induced minor LCA in vitro. None of these parameters were
affected in human fetal testis explants cultured with 10(-3) M MBP for up to 48
hr. Because the in vivo effects of DBP/MBP were not reproduced in vitro in the
rat, the absence of MBP effects in vitro on fetal human testes is inconclusive.
In newborn (Day 2-7) marmosets, administration of a single dose of 500 mg/kg MBP 
significantly (p = 0.019) suppressed blood testosterone levels 5 hr later.
Similar treatment of newborn co-twin male marmosets for 14 days resulted in
increased Leydig cell volume per testis (p = 0.011), compared with co-twin
controls; this is consistent with MBP-induced inhibition of steroidogenesis
followed by compensatory Leydig cell hyperplasia/hypertrophy.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that MBP/DBP suppresses steroidogenesis by
fetal-type Leydig cells in primates as in rodents, but this cannot be studied in 
vitro.

Using reverse transcription of whole cellular RNA and nested PCR, we have
performed experiments mixing different proportions of Epstein-Barr virus
(EBV)-carrying and EBV-negative cells. Based on the results, a method that
detects viral transcripts for EBNA-1, EBNA-2, LMP1, and LMP2a from less than one 
positive cell among 10(5) negative cells was developed. With this method we have 
shown that the EBV DNA positive cells among small, high-density peripheral blood 
B-lymphocytes of normal healthy persons express EBNA-1-mRNA but not EBNA-2 or
LMP1. A similar EBV expression pattern is found in type I Burkitt lymphoma cells.
We suggest that the expression pattern in the lymphoma cells reflects the viral
strategy in normal resting B cells and meets the requirements of latent
persistence.

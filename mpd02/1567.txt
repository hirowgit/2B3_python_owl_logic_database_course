Most neurons in primary visual cortex (V1) exhibit high selectivity for the
orientation of visual stimuli. In contrast, neurons in the main thalamic input to
V1, the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), are considered to be only weakly
orientation selective. Here we characterize a sparse population of cells in
marmoset LGN that show orientation and spatial frequency selectivity as great as 
that of cells in V1. The recording position in LGN and histological
reconstruction of these cells shows that they are part of the koniocellular (K)
pathways. Accordingly we have named them K-o ("koniocellular-orientation") cells.
Most K-o cells prefer vertically oriented gratings; their contrast sensitivity
and TF tuning are similar to those of parvocellular cells, and they receive
negligible functional input from short wavelength-sensitive ("blue") cone
photoreceptors. Four K-o cells tested displayed binocular responses. Our results 
provide further evidence that in primates as in nonprimate mammals the cortical
input streams include a diversity of visual representations. The presence of K-o 
cells increases functional homologies between K pathways in primates and
"sluggish/W" pathways in nonprimate visual systems.

A biosensor detecting estrogens, progestogens, and androgens in complex samples
and in a single step is described. Three Arxula adeninivorans yeast strains were 
created, each strain producing a different recombinant human hormone receptor and
a different fluorescent reporter protein. These strains were then mixed to create
G1212/YRC102-hHR-fluo, the biological component of the biosensor. During
incubation with G1212/YRC102-hHR-fluo, hormones present in a sample bind to their
target receptor, which leads to the production of a specific fluorescent protein.
Three fluorescence scans of the yeast suspension determine which fluorescence
protein has been produced, thus revealing which hormone receptor (estrogen,
progesterone, and androgen) has been activated by the hormones or hormone mimics 
present in the sample. The biosensor has similar sensitivities to the existing A.
adeninivorans cell-based assays. The detection of the three hormone classes in
one single experiment reduces the labor and time required to assay for the three 
hormone classes. The biosensor was also trialed with animal serum samples for the
detection of progestogens, androgens, and estrogens and gave results that
correlated well with ELISA analysis in case of progestogens. These results
highlight the potential usefulness of the biosensor for comprehensive
determination of hormone status in samples from veterinary origin. Biotechnol.

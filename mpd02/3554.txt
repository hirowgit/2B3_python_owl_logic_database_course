Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has been associated with several malignant processes in 
man, most notably Burkitt lymphoma in previously healthy individuals and lesions 
resembling large cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas in organ transplant recipients. Mice 
with the severe combined immunodeficiency phenotype (SCID mice) are exquisitely
susceptible to the development of EBV-associated lymphoproliferative lesions
following the intraperitoneal (ip) inoculation of EBV-infected human lymphocytes.
Recently, we reported that EBV-infected marmoset lymphocytes do not form
lymphomas in SCID mice following ip injection, while human lymphocytes infected
with the same EBV strains do. On the assumption that the EBV-infected marmoset
cells were lacking a factor necessary for tumor formation, we transfected a
plasmid containing c-myc into EBV-infected marmoset cells (B95-8, FF41, and W91
cells). Despite expression of the c-myc protein as determined by immunoblot and
flow cytometry when probed with a monoclonal antibody, no increase over baseline 
lesion development was seen in SCID mice inoculated with 5 x 10(6)
c-myc-expressing marmoset lymphoblastoid cells. Thus, cells that express c-myc
and harbor EBV are not sufficient to form lymphomas in certain immunocompromised 
hosts.

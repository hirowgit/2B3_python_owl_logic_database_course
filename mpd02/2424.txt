Factor Xa (FXa) is well known to play a pivotal role in blood coagulation, so FXa
inhibitor is a promising drug candidate for prophylaxis and treatment of
thromboembolic diseases. In the course of our research, we have found that
(R)-5-[1-(acetimidoyl)piperidin-4-yloxy]-2-(7-amidinonaphthalen-2-yl)-1-(ethanesu
lfonyl)indoline ((R)-1) showed potent FXa inhibitory activity in vitro. However, 
single oral administation (RS)-1 showed high toxicity in mice. Among newly
synthesized compounds,
({(RS)-5-[1-(acetimidoyl)piperidin-4-yloxy]-2-(7-amidinonaphthalen-2-yl)indolin-1
-yl}sulfonyl)acetic acid ((RS)-11d) showed more potent FXa inhibitory activity
and higher safety than (RS)-1. The R-isoform of compound 11d ((R)-11d) exhibited 
potent in vitro anticoagulant activity in human and hamster plasma. Orally
administered (R)-11d also showed dose-dependent potent anticoagulant activity in 
hamsters, marmosets and cynomolgus monkeys. Compound (R)-11d with potent
anticoagulant activity and high safety is therefore favorable as a novel oral FXa
inhibitor.

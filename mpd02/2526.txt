Remyelination can be very effective in human. However, this process ultimately
fails in multiple sclerosis (MS). In this paper, we discuss the possibility of
stimulating endogenous oligodendrocyte precursors to participate in remyelination
in experimental models (rat and primate Callithrix jacchus) of MS through thyroid
hormone (TH) administration. TH is in fact known to be a key signal in brain
development, oligodendrocyte development and myelin protein gene expression
regulation.

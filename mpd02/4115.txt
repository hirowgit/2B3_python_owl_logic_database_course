A system is described for the continuous measurement of blood pressure, heart
rate, and motor activity by telemetry in conscious marmosets freely moving in
their home cages. Consistent diurnal variations in these parameters were observed
under standard conditions, although these parameters were sensitive to changes in
the environment. Blood pressure values were similar to those measured by
nontelemetric methods in conscious, restrained marmosets. However, heart rate was
lower, indicating that telemetry is less stressful. The suitability of this
system for assessing the effects of blood pressure-lowering drugs was evaluated. 
An acute or a prolonged treatment with a converting enzyme inhibitor of marmosets
maintained on a low-sodium diet induced a fall in blood pressure as previously
observed using nontelemetric methods. With telemetry, however, more accurate
information on the duration of response and the effects of the treatment on the
diurnal rhythms was obtained. These observations demonstrate the advantages of
telemetry for evaluating the hemodynamic effects of drug treatments under
physiological conditions.

A conveyor belt task for assessing visuo-motor coordination in the marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus): effects of diazepam, chlorpromazine, pentobarbital and
d-amphetamine.

D'Mello GD, Duffy EA, Miles SS.

A conveyor belt task for assessing visuo-motor coordination in the marmoset is
described. Animals are motivated by apple, a preferred food, under a state of
minimal food deprivation. The apparatus used was designed to test animals within 
their home cages and not restrained in any way, thus avoiding possible
confounding factors associated with restraint stress. Stable baseline levels of
performance were reached by all animals in a median of 24 sessions. Performance
was shown to be differentially sensitive to the effects of four psychoactive
drugs. Moderate doses of diazepam, chlorpromazine and pentobarbital disrupted
visuo-motor coordination in a dose-related manner. The possibility that
disruption of performance observed at higher doses may have resulted from
non-specific actions of these drugs such as decreases in feeding motivation were 
not supported by results from ancillary experiments. Changes in performance
characteristic of high dose effects were similar in nature to changes observed
when the degree of task difficulty was increased. Doses of d-amphetamine up to
and including those reported to produce signs of stereotypy failed to influence
performance. The potential of the conveyor belt task for measuring visuo-motor
coordination in both primate and rodent species is discussed.

Genetic therapies for cystic fibrosis (CF) must be assessed for safety and
efficacy, so testing in a non-human primate (NHP) model is invaluable. In this
pilot study we determined if the conducting airways of marmosets (n = 2) could be
transduced using an airway pre-treatment followed by an intratracheal bolus dose 
of a VSV-G pseudotyped HIV-1 based lentiviral (LV) vector (LacZ reporter). LacZ
gene expression (X-gal) was assessed after 7 days and found primarily in
conducting airway epithelia as well as in alveolar regions. The LacZ gene was not
detected in liver or spleen via qPCR. Vector p24 protein bio-distribution into
blood was transient. Dosing was well tolerated. This preliminary study confirmed 
the transducibility of CF-relevant airway cell types. The marmoset is a promising
NHP model for testing and translating genetic treatments for CF airway disease
towards clinical trials.

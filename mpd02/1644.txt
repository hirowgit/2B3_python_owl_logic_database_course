There has been a recent resurgence of interest in New World monkeys within the
biomedical research community, driven by both the sequencing of the common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) genome and a growing demand for alternatives to Old
World primates. New World monkeys offer attractive advantages over Old World
species, including cheaper and simpler husbandry, while still maintaining a
greater evolutionary proximity to humans compared with other animal models.
Although numerous commonalities across primate species exist, there are also
important genetic and reproductive differences that can and should play a
critical role in selecting appropriate animal models. Common marmosets in
particular have significantly reduced diversity at the major histocompatibility
complex (MHC) loci and are born as hematopoietic chimeras. New World primates can
make ideal translational models for research, but scientists must necessarily
incorporate complete understandings of their genetic and phenotypic differences
from humans and other model organisms.

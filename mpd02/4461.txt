Attempts to infect the New World marmot Callithrix penicillata with Plasmodium
falciparum were unsuccessful. Attempts were also made to infect red blood cells
of C. penicillata and Saimiri sciureus with P. falciparum in vitro, and these too
were unsuccessful due to a high rate of hemolysis produced by apparently adverse 
culture conditions. It is concluded that modifications to the existing culture
conditions will need to be made before successful parasitemia can be induced in
vitro in simian erythrocytes.

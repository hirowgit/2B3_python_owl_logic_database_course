In the human disease multiple sclerosis (MS), the immune mechanisms responsible
for selective destruction of central nervous system myelin are unknown. In the
common marmoset Callithrix jacchus, a unique demyelinating form of experimental
allergic encephalomyelitis resembling MS can be induced by immunization with
whole myelin. Here we show that the MS-like lesion can be reproduced by
immunization against the extracellular domain of a single myelin protein,
myelin/oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG). By contrast, immunization against the 
quantitatively major myelin proteins myelin basic protein or proteolipid protein 
results in inflammation but little or no demyelination. Furthermore, in the
presence of encephalitogenic (e.g., disease-inducing) T cells, the fully
demyelinated lesion is reconstructed by systemic administration of IgG purified
from whole myelin-, or MOG-immunized animals, and equally by a monoclonal
antibody against MOG, but not by control IgG. Encephalitogenic T cells may
contribute to the MS-like lesion through disruption of the blood-brain barrier
that permits access of demyelinating antibody into the nervous system. The
identification of MOG as a major target antigen for autoimmune demyelination in a
nonhuman primate should facilitate development of specific immunotherapies for
human MS.

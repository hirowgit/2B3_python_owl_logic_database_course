Low-iodine diet for the production of severe I deficiency in marmosets
(Callithrix jacchus jacchus).

Mano MT, Potter BJ, Belling GB, Hetzel BS.

A low-iodine diet consisting of maize, peas (Pisum sativum), torula yeast, meat
meal, maize oil and added vitamins, minerals and amino acids was given to eight
pairs of adult, common cotton-eared marmosets (Callithrix jacchus jacchus). Eight
control pairs were given the same diet to which potassium iodate was added. Both 
groups also received low-I apple and deionized water. The diet provided adequate 
nutrition, as confirmed by the maintenance of body-weight and good health. In the
I-deficient marmosets the concentration of plasma thyroxine was decreased from
140.1 nmol/l to 22.4 nmol/l and thyroid-stimulating hormone increased
significantly from 1.8 ng/ml to 9.0 ng/ml compared with control marmosets,
thereby indicating severe I deficiency. Compared with newborn offspring from
control marmosets, the thyroid glands from the I-deficient offspring showed an
increase in weight, a decrease in I content and, on histological examination,
hyperplasia, hypertrophy and a total absence of colloid material in the
follicles.

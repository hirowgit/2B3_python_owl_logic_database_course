BACKGROUND: Common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) are susceptible to
gastrointestinal diseases. Sensitivity to nutritional elements, for example
gluten, has been suggested, but a serological screening has not been performed
yet.
METHODS: A gluten-containing diet was offered to 24 animals, followed by a
gluten-free diet. During these diets, serum IgA antibodies to gliadin (AGA),
tissue transglutaminase (tTG), deamidated gliadin (ADGA), and glycoprotein 2
(AGP2A) were determined. Body weight, diarrhea, and other clinical symptoms were 
recorded.
RESULTS: Gluten increased AGA, tTG, and AGP2A concentrations in 13 of 24 animals.
A significant decline of AGA and AGP2A was seen on gluten withdrawal. Positive
(AGA, tTG) animals presented diarrhea more frequently on gluten-containing diet
and showed significantly increased body weight on gluten-free diet compared to
negative animals.
CONCLUSION: Gluten ingestion caused gastrointestinal symptoms in common
marmosets, which disappeared on gluten withdrawal. Considering the immunological 
response to both diets, gluten sensitivity seems to be most likely.

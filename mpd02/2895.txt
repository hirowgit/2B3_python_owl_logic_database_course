The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a small-bodied, adaptable New World
primate from secondary forests in Brazil that is used in various types of
research, such as reproductive biology, neuroendocrinology, behavioral research, 
neuroscience, infectious disease, and drug development. Because of their small
body size, adaptability to a variety of conditions, unique physiologic
characteristics, family social structure, and calm demeanor, they have become the
primate of choice for certain research areas. However, because of their small
body size, the amount and type of samples that can be obtained from them can
prove to be challenging. The objective of the study reported here is to review
some techniques developed for obtaining samples or data from marmoset monkeys in 
a variety of research settings and includes restraint methods that work well for 
the type of sample collection required.

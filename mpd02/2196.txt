PURPOSE: To determine the effects of imposed anisometropic retinal defocus on
accommodation, ocular growth, and refractive state changes in marmosets.
METHODS: Marmosets were raised with extended-wear soft contact lenses for an
average duration of 10 weeks beginning at an average age of 76 d. Experimental
animals wore either a positive or negative power contact lens over one eye and a 
plano lens or no lens over the other. Another group wore binocular lenses of
equal magnitude but opposite sign. Untreated marmosets served as controls and
three wore plano lenses monocularly. Cycloplegic refractive state, corneal
curvature, and vitreous chamber depth were measured before, during, and after the
period of lens wear. To investigate the accommodative response, the effective
refractive state was measured through each anisometropic condition at varying
accommodative stimuli positions using an infrared refractometer.
RESULTS: Eye growth and refractive state are significantly correlated with the
sign and power of the contact lens worn. The eyes of marmosets reared with
monocular negative power lenses had longer vitreous chambers and were myopic
relative to contralateral control eyes (p < 0.01). Monocular positive power
lenses produced a significant reduction in vitreous chamber depth and hyperopia
relative to the contralateral control eyes (p < 0.05). In marmosets reared
binocularly with lenses of opposite sign, we found larger interocular differences
in vitreous chamber depths and refractive state (p < 0.001). Accommodation
influences the defocus experienced through the lenses, however, the mean
effective refractive state was still hyperopia in the negative-lens-treated eyes 
and myopia in the positive-lens-treated eyes.
CONCLUSIONS: Imposed anisometropia effectively alters marmoset eye growth and
refractive state to compensate for the imposed defocus. The response to imposed
hyperopia is larger and faster than the response to imposed myopia. The pattern
of accommodation under imposed anisometropia produces effective refractive states
that are consistent with the changes in eye growth and refractive state observed.

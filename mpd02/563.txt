Response inhibition (inhibiting prepotent responses) is needed for reaching a
more favourable goal in situations where reacting automatically would be
detrimental. Inhibiting prepotent responses to resist the temptation of a
stimulus in certain situations, such as a novel food item, can directly affect an
animal's survival. In humans and dogs, response inhibition varies between
contexts and between individuals. We used two contextually different experiments 
to investigate response inhibition in the eastern water skink (Eulamprus quoyii):
reversal of a visual two-choice discrimination and a cylinder detour task. During
the two-choice task, half of our lizards were able to reach an initial learning
criterion, but, thereafter, did not show consistent performance. Only two
individuals reached a more stringent criterion, but subsequently failed during
reversals. Furthermore, half of our animals were not able to inhibit a
pre-existing side preference which affected their ability to learn during the
two-choice task. Skinks were, however, able to achieve a detour around a cylinder
performing at levels comparable to brown lemurs, marmosets, and some parrot
species. A comparison between the tasks showed that reaching the initial
criterion was associated with low success during the detour task, indicating that
response inhibition could be context-specific in the water skink. To the best of 
our knowledge, this is the first study to examine inhibitory control and motor
self-regulation in a lizard species.

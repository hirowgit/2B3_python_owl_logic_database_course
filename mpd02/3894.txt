A system is described for the continuous measurement of blood pressure, heart
rate and motor activity by telemetry in conscious marmosets freely moving in
their home cages. Consistent diurnal variations in these parameters were observed
under standard conditions. However these parameters were sensitive to changes in 
the environment. Blood pressure values were similar to those measured by
non-telemetric methods in conscious restrained marmosets while heart rate values 
were significantly lower.

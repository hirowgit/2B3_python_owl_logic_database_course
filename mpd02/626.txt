Pathogens, particularly human herpesviruses (HHVs), are implicated as triggers of
disease onset/progression in multiple sclerosis (MS) and other neuroinflammatory 
disorders. However, the time between viral acquisition in childhood and disease
onset in adulthood complicates the study of this association. Using nonhuman
primates, we demonstrate that intranasal inoculations with HHV-6A and HHV-6B
accelerate an MS-like neuroinflammatory disease, experimental autoimmune
encephalomyelitis (EAE). Although animals inoculated intranasally with HHV-6
(virus/EAE marmosets) were asymptomatic, they exhibited significantly accelerated
clinical EAE compared with control animals. Expansion of a proinflammatory CD8
subset correlated with post-EAE survival in virus/EAE marmosets, suggesting that 
a peripheral (viral?) antigen-driven expansion may have occurred post-EAE
induction. HHV-6 viral antigen in virus/EAE marmosets was markedly elevated and
concentrated in brain lesions, similar to previously reported localizations of
HHV-6 in MS brain lesions. Collectively, we demonstrate that asymptomatic
intranasal viral acquisition accelerates subsequent neuroinflammation in a
nonhuman primate model of MS.

The nucleotide sequences of the gibbon and marmoset myc loci have been determined
by the dideoxy ribomethod. The number of mutations which occurred during
evolution and the branches affected were deduced according to the principle of
maximum parsimony, from a comparison with known mammal sequences. As previously
observed for the human and chimpanzee myc genes, an Alu repeat belonging to
subclass III was observed in the second intron of the gibbon myc gene. In
contrast, no such element was found in the marmoset gene. Alignment of the Myc
amino acid (aa) sequences provided clues for detecting which aa or which protein 
regions have been more heavily mutated. Conversely, some regions remained free of
mutations and remained unchanged from mouse to human, most probably in connection
with some important embedded property(ies). An intriguing feature of the human
Myc protein is duplication of 50 aa out of 439. Strikingly, most of these aa
remain unchanged in mouse, rat, cat, marmoset, gibbon, chimpanzee and human.

Sensory systems face a barrage of stimulation that continually changes along
multiple dimensions. These simultaneous changes create a formidable problem for
the nervous system, as neurons must dynamically encode each stimulus dimension,
despite changes in other dimensions. Here, we measured how neurons in visual
cortex encode orientation following changes in luminance and contrast, which are 
critical for visual processing, but nuisance variables in the context of
orientation coding. Using information theoretic analysis and population decoding 
approaches, we find that orientation discriminability is luminance and contrast
dependent, changing over time due to firing rate adaptation. We also show that
orientation discrimination in human observers changes during adaptation, in a
manner consistent with the neuronal data. Our results suggest that adaptation
does not maintain information rates per se, but instead acts to keep sensory
systems operating within the limited dynamic range afforded by spiking activity, 
despite a wide range of possible inputs.

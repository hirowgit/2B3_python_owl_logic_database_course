The cognitive-enhancing potential of the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) selective
5-HT3 receptor antagonist, ondansetron, was investigated in a model of cognitive 
impairment induced by the muscarinic receptor antagonist, scopolamine. For this
purpose, marmosets were trained in an object discrimination task utilizing the
Wisconsin General Test Apparatus. Administration of scopolamine (0.01-0.04 mg/kg,
SC) caused a dose-dependent impairment in the acquisition of the object
discrimination task in that marmosets required more trials to reach criterion,
made more errors, and took longer to choose the objects. Administration of
arecoline (0.06-0.1 mg/kg, SC) or
1,2,3,9-tetrahydro-9-methyl-3-[(2-methyl-1H-imidazol-
1-yl)methyl]-4H-carbazol-4-one,HCl.2H2O (ondansetron) (0.1-1 micrograms/kg, SC)
prevented the scopolamine-induced impairment in task acquisition in that the
performance of marmosets was indistinguishable from that of saline-treated
animals and was significantly better than that following scopolamine/saline. From
these studies, we conclude that ondansetron prevents impairment in the cognitive 
performance of marmosets induced by administration of scopolamine.

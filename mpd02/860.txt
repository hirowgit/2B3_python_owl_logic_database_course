Common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) have been suggested as a new model for
analysis of age-related changes and neurodegenerative diseases. However, the
effects of age on learning and memory processes are not well defined within this 
species. Therefore, we employed visual discrimination and reversal learning tasks
to evaluate learning and memory in four aged common marmosets relative to a
younger cohort. We found that aged marmosets commit significantly more errors in 
initial stages of visual discrimination and more perseverative errors in reversal
learning, indicating prefrontal dysfunction. However, they showed comparable
performance with younger marmosets in the later stages of both tasks.

We describe a novel soft jacket and sling-harness restraint that permits
species-typical postures for small-bodied primates, such as the common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus), during long-term (>6 h), continuous restraint. The
restraint system is straightforward to use and manipulate, it is easily repaired,
and the materials used are readily available. The soft jacket allows for
increased versatility and longevity, and the sling-harness provides for greater
movement and much longer duration of continuous restraint (up to 3 days) compared
to a previously described, more conventional chair restraint for small-bodied
primates. The new restraint system prevents the normal diurnal decrease in plasma
cortisol levels across the daylight hours; however, it does not disrupt ovulatory
cycles. Unlike the previously available techniques, therefore, this new restraint
system is applicable to many neurobiological and neuroendocrine studies involving
small-bodied, non-human primates and is especially suited to investigations
requiring the maintenance of relationships within social groups.

The complete RNA genome sequence of Tianjin strain, isolated from marmoset, has
been determined. The genome was 15,384 nucleotides (nt) in length, which was
identical to that of Sendai virus (SeV), and consisted of six genes in the order 
3'-NP-P/C-M-F-HN-L-5'. The gene junctions contained highly conserved
transcription start and stop signal sequences and trinucleotide intergenic
regions (IGR) similar to those of SeV. There was also an overlapping open reading
frame and a conserved AnGn site (AAAAAGGG) in the P mRNA. Phylogenetic analysis
based on protein sequences from other members of the family Paramyxoviridae
showed that Tianjin strain belonged to the genus Respirovirus and was most
closely related to SeV. Pairwise comparisons of amino acid identities and
phylogenetic analysis with homologous sequences of known SeVs demonstrated that
Tianjin strain represented a new evolutionary lineage of SeV.

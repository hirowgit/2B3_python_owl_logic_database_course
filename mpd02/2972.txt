The acoustic features useful for converting auditory information into perceived
objects are poorly understood. Although auditory cortex neurons have been
described as being narrowly tuned and preferentially responsive to narrowband
signals, naturally occurring sounds are generally wideband with unique spectral
energy profiles. Through the use of parametric wideband acoustic stimuli, we
found that such neurons in awake marmoset monkeys respond vigorously to wideband 
sounds having complex spectral shapes, preferring stimuli of either high or low
spectral contrast. Low contrast-preferring neurons cannot be studied thoroughly
with narrowband stimuli and have not been previously described. These findings
indicate that spectral contrast reflects an important stimulus decomposition in
auditory cortex and may contribute to the recognition of acoustic objects.

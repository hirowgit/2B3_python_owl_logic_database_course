Since species interdiversity often prevents the extrapolation of laboratory
rodent data to man and similar problems may exist for nitric oxide synthase
(NOS), NADPH-d activity and immunohistochemistry of NOS were investigated in the 
New World monkey Callithrix jacchus (marmoset), which has been shown to be close 
to the human situation in many respects. Using the NADPHd reaction with
beta-NADPH and nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) on acetone-chloroform pretreated
cryosections, NBT formazan was found in many neural and non-neural (e.g. diverse 
epithelia, striated muscle fibers, vascular endothelium) cells in numerous
tissues and organs. Prefixation with formaldehyde lowered the number of NADPH-d
active sites and the amount of formazan with the exception of neuronal NADPH-d as
did incubation of fresh or acetone-chloroform-pretreated sections for NADPH-d in 
the presence of 0.5% formaldehyde. When 1% formaldehyde or 0.5 mM permanganate
were used significant amounts of formazan appeared only in central and peripheral
neurons, vasal endothelial cells, small intestinal enterocytes, plasma membrane
region of striated muscle fibers as well as arteriolar cells in the kidney;
except for enterocytes, these observations were confirmed by
NOS-immunohistochemistry which revealed in addition reactive cells in the thymus 
and intestinal lamina propria.

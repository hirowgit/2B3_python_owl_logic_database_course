Physical, hormonal and behavioural aspects of sexual development in the marmoset 
monkey, Callithrix jacchus.

Abbott DH, Hearn JP.

Measurements of growth, plasma progesterone and testosterone levels, and
copulatory behaviour were obtained from captive marmosets from birth until
600-800 days of age. Body weight and knee-to-heel length were similar for both
sexes. Males exhibited a neonatal testosterone surge from 15-100 days and
testosterone levels began to rise again, coincident with the growth of the
testis, at about 250 days. The males were copulating by 400-500 days of age.
Paired females were apparently ovulating and able to conceive from about 400
days. In peer groups, only the dominant female became pregnant, because
subordinate females failed to ovulate.

A growing number of human inflammatory disorders are reported to respond to
treatment with thalidomide, and recently this drug has been shown to inhibit
angiogenesis in the rabbit, in doses which can elicit teratogenicity in this
species. Studies in marmosets and humans indicate that thalidomide, and a
teratogenic analogue, decrease the expression of beta integrin subunits, most
notably beta 3 and the beta 2 produced by leukocytes. Since integrins are crucial
for cell-matrix interactions, and the beta 2 integrins of leukocytes mediate
adhesion to endothelium, it is reasonable to postulate that thalidomide inhibits 
cell migration in susceptible species, and that this accounts for its
anti-inflammatory, anti-angiogenic, and teratogenic activity. This perspective
suggests that thalidomide will show utility in the prevention or treatment of a
wide range of disorders, including solid tumors, proliferative retinopathies,
many inflammatory diseases, neointimal hyperplasia, and osteoporosis. It is
likely that dietary fish oil-as well as selective inhibitors of urokinase, when
and if they become clinically available-will complement the efficacy of
thalidomide in most if not all of these applications.

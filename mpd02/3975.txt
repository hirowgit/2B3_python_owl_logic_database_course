We examined whether or not the antiparkinsonian activity of talipexole (B-HT 920,
6-allyl-2-amino-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-4H-thiazolo[4,5-d]-azepine) could be optimised
by combination with L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-dopa). Additionally, the
effects of chronic treatment with talipexole on motor behavior were investigated 
using 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated and normal
common marmosets. Administration of MPTP (0.5 mg/animal i.v. once or twice) to
marmosets induced persistent parkinsonian motor deficits. The antiparkinsonian
activity of talipexole (40 micrograms/kg s.c.) was significantly enhanced by its 
combination with L-dopa (30 mg/kg i.p.). This may further support the postulated 
postsynaptic dopamine D2 receptor agonist properties of talipexole. Chronic
treatment with talipexole (a daily dose of 40 micrograms/kg s.c. for 21 days) did
not lead to tolerance to the antiparkinsonian activity in MPTP-treated animals.
No obvious dyskinesia was seen throughout the chronic treatment. In contrast, in 
normal marmosets, talipexole at a dose of 80 micrograms/kg which is a dose
sufficient to induce hyperactivity did not increase motor activity during the
treatment repeated for 21 days. These results suggest that talipexole is a
selective dopamine D2 receptor agonist drug of potential use in the treatment of 
Parkinson's disease.

Microelectrodes were used to record from somatosensory areas 3b and adjoining
areas 3a and 1 in newborn monkeys. At birth, area 3b was responsive to cutaneous 
stimuli and had an adult-like somatotopic organization in marmosets and one
squirrel monkey, while areas 1 and 3a had only limited responsiveness. In newborn
macaque monkeys, cortex was unresponsive to cutaneous stimuli; however, by 1
month, areas 3b and 1 appeared to be adult-like in responsiveness and somatotopic
organization.

Cooperatively breeding common marmosets show substantial variation in the amount 
of help they provide. Pay-to-stay and social prestige models of helping attribute
this variation to audience effects, i.e. that individuals help more if group
members can witness their interactions with immatures, whereas models of kin
selection, group augmentation or those stressing the need to gain parenting
experience do not predict any audience effects. We quantified the readiness of
adult marmosets to share food in the presence or absence of other group members. 
Contrary to both predictions, we found a reverse audience effect on food-sharing 
behaviour: marmosets would systematically share more food with immatures when no 
audience was present. Thus, helping in common marmosets, at least in related
family groups, does not support the pay-to-stay or the social prestige model, and
helpers do not take advantage of the opportunity to engage in reputation
management. Rather, the results appear to reflect a genuine concern for the
immatures' well-being, which seems particularly strong when solely responsible
for the immatures.

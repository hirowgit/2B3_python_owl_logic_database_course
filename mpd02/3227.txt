BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: NXY-059 is a novel nitrone with free radical-trapping
properties that has a considerable neuroprotective effect in rats. We have now
examined the efficacy of this drug at reducing long-term functional disability in
a primate model of stroke.
METHODS: Twelve monkeys were trained and tested on a variety of behavioral tasks 
used to dissociate and quantify motor and spatial deficits. Five minutes after
permanent occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery, monkeys received a 1-mL 
intravenous infusion of either saline or NXY-059 (28 mg x kg(-1)), and osmotic
minipumps, model 2001D, were implanted subcutaneously to provide continuous drug 
or saline infusion for 48 hours. Drug-filled pumps released NXY-059 at 16 mg x
kg(-1) x h(-1). The monkeys were retested 3 and 10 weeks after surgery to assess 
functional disability. Surgery, behavioral testing, and histology were all done
blinded to treatment condition.
RESULTS: NXY-059-treated monkeys were significantly better at reaching with their
hemiparetic arm than were saline-treated monkeys when retested 3 weeks (P:<0.01) 
and 10 weeks (P:<0.01) after surgery. Drug treatment also significantly lessened 
the degree of spatial perceptual neglect (P:<0.01), a debilitating though
ameliorating consequence of this infarct. NXY-059 treatment reduced the overall
amount of brain damage by >50% of saline-treatment values, with similar levels of
protection afforded to both white and gray matter.
CONCLUSIONS: This novel drug has a substantial protective effect, lessening the
disability caused by an experimentally induced stroke in a primate species. These
findings provide considerable encouragement for the clinical development of
NXY-059.

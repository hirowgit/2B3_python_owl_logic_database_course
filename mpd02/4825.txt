Density distribution, characterization, and comparative aspects of the major
serum lipoproteins in the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a New World
primate with potential use in lipoprotein research.

Qualitative, quantitative, and comparative aspects of the serum lipoprotein
profile in the Common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a New World primate, are
described. Density gradient ultracentrifugation was used to evaluate lipoprotein 
distribution and to establish criteria for isolation of discrete molecular
fractions. The major lipoprotein classes banded isopycnically on the gradient
with the following hydrated densities: VLDL, d less than 1.017 g/mL; LDL, d =
1.027--1.055 g/mL; HDL fraction I, d = 1.070--1.127 g/mL; and HDL fraction II, d 
= 1.127--1.156 g/mL. Electrophoretic, immunological, and electron microscopic
analyses attested to the purity of these fractions: the characteristics of each
were assessed by chemical analysis, electron microscopy, immunological
techniques, and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of their protein moieties.
Marmoset VLDL and LDL were closely akin to those of man in size and chemical
composition, although the former were richer in triglyceride; electrophoretic and
immunological data showed the major protein component of VLDL and LDL to be a
counterpart to human apo-B. The two HDL subfractions, i.e., HDL-I and HDL-II,
corresponded in size and chemical composition to human HDL2 and HDL3,
respectively, although slight differences in neutral lipid content were detected.
By immunological and electrophoretic criteria, the major apolipoprotein of
marmoset HDL was analogous to human apo-AI. In contrast, marked dissimilarities
were evident in the complements of low molecular weight, tetramethylurea-soluble 
polypeptides of marmoset and human lipoproteins. Quantitatively, the human and
marmoset lipoprotein profiles were not dissimilar, although HDL was the major
class (approximately 50%); in fasting animals, serum concentrations of VLDL, LDL,
and HDL were 50--90, 170--280, and 338--408 mg/dL, respectively. C. jacchus was
distinct from man in displaying a greater proportion of its total HDL in the less
dense (HDL-II) subfraction (marmoset HDL-I/HDL-II = approximately 4:1; human
HDL2/HDL3 = approximately 1:3). These data indicate that, as an experimental
animal for lipoprotein research, the Common marmoset combines the advantages of
ready availability and maintenance with a serum lipoprotein profile which
resembles, in many qualitative and quantitative aspects, that found in man.

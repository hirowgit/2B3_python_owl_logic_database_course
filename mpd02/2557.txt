Two hundred common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) from control groups (100 males,
100 females) of toxicological studies were examined histopathologically to
evaluate the spectrum of spontaneous lesions in this species. Frequent findings
were extramedullary hematopoiesis affecting adrenal glands, liver, kidney and
spleen, cystic Brunner's glands in the duodenum, acute or subacute inflammation
in the large intestine and gall bladder, renal mineralization and pigmentation,
hepatic Ito-cell vacuolation, microgranuloma and glycogen storage, pituitary
cysts, C-cell hyperplasia and lymphocytic foci of the thyroid gland, luteal
hyperplasia of the ovary and inflammatory cell foci in various organs.

Urban areas and many natural habitats are being dominated by a new selection
pressure: anthropogenic noise. The ongoing expansion of urban areas, roads and
airports throughout the world makes the noise almost omnipresent. Urbanization
and the increase of noise levels form a major threat to living conditions in and 
around cities. Insight into the behavioural strategies of urban survivors may
explain the sensitivity of other species to urban selection pressures. Here, we
show that urban black-tufted marmosets (Callithrix penicillata) living in noisy
urban areas may select their home-range based primarily on ambient noise level.
We have tested the hypothesis that the noise from vehicular traffic and visitors 
in an urban park in Brazil influences the use of home-range (space) by urban
marmosets. Marmosets even avoided noisy areas with high food availability. In
addition, they systematically preferred the quieter areas even with dynamic
changes in the acoustic landscape of the park between weekdays and Sundays (no
observations were made on Saturdays). These data provide evidence that the use of
home-range by wild animals can be affected by a potential aversive stimulus such 
as noise pollution.

Common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) were allowed to lick sucrose solutions
freely in 30-min sessions. We examined how the rate of licking changed in the
course of a session and how the pattern of changes was affected by different
concentrations (1%, 5%, and 25%) of solutions. The results showed that licking
rates decreased monotonically regardless of the concentrations and that the
decreasing patterns could be reasonably explained by exponential functions. The
rates of decrease were slowest for the 5% solution and fastest for the 1%
solution. The linear relation between the number of licks in a short interval and
the cumulative number of licks before that interval, which was suggested by
Aoyama (1996), did not always hold. The cumulative records of licking for
individual sessions revealed that a break-and-run pattern of licking sometimes
dominated after a licking rate slowed down, and that this pattern could disturb
the linear relation.

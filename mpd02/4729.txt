Junin virus infection of Callithrix jacchus: pathologic features.

Gonz√°lez PH, Laguens RP, Frigerio MJ, Calello MA, Weissenbacher MC.

Infection of Callithrix jacchus, a New World primate, with the prototype strain
of Junin virus produced a severe disease. The animals developed multifocal
hemorrhages and characteristic microscopic lesions such as meningoencephalitis,
interstitial pneumonia, lymphocytic depletion of lymphatic tissue, hepatocytic
necrosis, and a variable decrease in bone marrow cellularity. High virus
concentrations correlated with lesions, and with the presence of viral antigenic 
determinants as revealed by immunofluorescent methods. With the exception of
central nervous system damage, the morphological features and immunohistochemical
and viral findings were similar to those recorded in human Argentine hemorrhagic 
fever.

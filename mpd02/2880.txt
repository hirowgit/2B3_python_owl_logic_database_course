We examined the retinotopic mapping of the visual world in the primary visual
cortex of the marmoset monkey using differential optical imaging. Two sets of
complementary stripe-like locations were visually stimulated in turn. Their
difference depicts the cortical representations of continuous bands of visual
space. By rotating the sets of stripe-like locations it is possible to map
different spatial axes. Analogous to the macaque we found that the V1/V2 border
represented the vertical meridian, while horizontal, 45-, and 135-degree angled
stripes of space were also represented in a continuous manner. We developed a new
automatic method of calculating local measures of cortical magnification from our
optical retinotopic maps. Using this method we found no evidence of any local
anisotropies in cortical representation. Overall our results indicate that space 
is mapped isotropically in the primary visual cortex of the common marmoset.

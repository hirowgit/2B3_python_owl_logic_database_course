Social cognition is a dynamic process that requires the perception and
integration of a complex set of idiosyncratic features between interacting
conspecifics. Here we present a method for simultaneously measuring the
whole-brain activation of two socially interacting marmoset monkeys using
functional magnetic resonance imaging. MRI hardware (a radiofrequency coil and
peripheral devices) and image-processing pipelines were developed to assess brain
responses to socialization, both on an intra-brain and inter-brain level.
Notably, the brain activation of a marmoset when viewing a second marmoset
in-person versus when viewing a pre-recorded video of the same marmoset-i.e.,
when either capable or incapable of socially interacting with a visible
conspecific-demonstrates increased activation in the face-patch network. This
method enables a wide range of possibilities for potentially studying social
function and dysfunction in a non-human primate model.

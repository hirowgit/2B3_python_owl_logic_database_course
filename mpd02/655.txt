Rodent laboratory animals, such as mice and rats have been greatly contributing
to biomedical research. Although its usefulness would not change in the future,
nonhuman primates (NHPs) also offer excellent models for preclinical research to 
assess safety and efficacy of developing novel therapeutic approaches because of 
their similarities of genetics, metabolism and physiological characteristics to
humans. Recent years, the gene modification technology in nonhuman primates has
been developed. In fact, pre-clinical studies using nonhuman primates are
increasing in the world, especially in the neuroscience research field. Among the
NHPs, the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is one of a suitable NHP
laboratory animal for producing genetically modified models because they are
fecund animal. This article outlines the common marmoset and that of the disease 
models.

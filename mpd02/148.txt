The accurate and complete assembly of both haplotype sequences of a diploid
organism is essential to understanding the role of variation in genome functions,
phenotypes and diseases1. Here, using a trio-binning approach, we present a
high-quality, diploid reference genome, with both haplotypes assembled
independently at the chromosome level, for the common marmoset (Callithrix
jacchus), an primate model system that is widely used in biomedical research2,3. 
The full spectrum of heterozygosity between the two haplotypes involves 1.36% of 
the genome-much higher than the 0.13% indicated by the standard estimation based 
on single-nucleotide heterozygosity alone. The de novo mutation rate is
0.43 × 10-8 per site per generation, and the paternal inherited genome acquired
twice as many mutations as the maternal. Our diploid assembly enabled us to
discover a recent expansion of the sex-differentiation region and unique
evolutionary changes in the marmoset Y chromosome. In addition, we identified
many genes with signatures of positive selection that might have contributed to
the evolution of Callithrix biological features. Brain-related genes were highly 
conserved between marmosets and humans, although several genes experienced
lineage-specific copy number variations or diversifying selection, with
implications for the use of marmosets as a model system.

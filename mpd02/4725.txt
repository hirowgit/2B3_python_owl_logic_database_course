Histopathology of experimental Legionnaires' disease in guinea pigs, rhesus
monkeys and marmosets.

Baskerville A, Fitzgeorge RB, Broster M, Hambleton P.

Guinea pigs, rhesus monkeys and marmosets were infected with L. pneumophila in
small particle aerosols. Fever and acute fibrinopurulent pneumonia resulted. The 
lesions involved distal lung tissue only, spreading from terminal and respiratory
bronchioles and producing heavy infiltration of alveoli by polymorphs and
macrophages and widespread exudation of oedema fluid and fibrin. Lesions were not
found in extra-pulmonary sites.

The sexual behaviour of 7 adult male marmosets and their ovariectomized partners 
was observed during pair-tests before and after bilateral dorsal penile nerve
transection (n = 4) or a sham operation (n = 3). After transection of the dorsal 
penile nerves, males mounted more frequently and the initial mount of each test
was more prolonged. Males continued to orientate correctly during mounts and to
make rapid pelvic thrusts, with the erect penis close to the vaginal orifice.
However, the deep pelvic thrust required to attain intromission was abolished.
Intromission was rarely observed postoperatively and ejaculation occurred only
twice, in one male. These effects were not observed in sham-operated males. The
results show that afferent impulses from the penis, travelling through the dorsal
penile nerves, play a vital role in the coordination of intromission and
ejaculation in this primate species.

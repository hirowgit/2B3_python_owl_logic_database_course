The uniformly dense staining for cytochrome oxidase (CO) in layer IV of area 17
in adult monkeys has been described as developing from a bilaminar pattern in
neonates being composed of a broad CO band in layer IV alpha and a narrow CO band
attributed to the innermost zone of layer IV beta. Here we present evidence, in
the neonate marmoset monkey, for the narrow CO band to be localized in the
outermost rim of layer V, designated as sublayer Va.

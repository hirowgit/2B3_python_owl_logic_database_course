The most important acoustic cues available to the brain for sound localization
are produced by the interaction of sound with the animal's head and external
ears. As a first step in understanding the relation between these cues and their 
neural representation in a vocal new-world primate, we measured head-related
transfer functions (HRTFs) across frequency for a wide range of sound locations
in three anesthetized marmoset monkeys. The HRTF magnitude spectrum has a broad
resonance peak at 6-12 kHz that coincides with the frequency range of the major
call types of this species. A prominent first spectral notch (FN) in the HRTF
magnitude above this resonance was observed at most source locations. The center 
frequency of the FN increased monotonically from approximately 12 to 26 kHz with 
increases in elevation in the lateral field. In the frontal field FN frequency
changed in a less orderly fashion with source position. From the HRTFs we derived
interaural time (ITDs) and level differences (ILDs). ITDs and ILDs (below 12 kHz)
varied as a function of azimuth between +/-250 micros and +/-20dB, respectively. 
A reflexive orienting behavioral paradigm was used to confirm that marmosets can 
orient to sound sources.

BACKGROUND: This study investigated the effects of inhibition of vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) during the first postpartum cycle in marmosets
housed with a fertile male where a 90% fertility rate is normal.
METHODS: On resumption of mating, females were treated with either 25 mg/kg
aflibercept, a potent VEGF inhibitor, or control Fc protein (n=6 per group) at
the time of ovulation. Effects on timing of pregnancy were monitored by measuring
plasma progesterone, chorionic gonadotropin (CG) and uterine palpation.
RESULTS: In five of six Fc-treated controls, the postpartum rise in progesterone 
was maintained and followed by a sustained rise in CG by Day 30 posttreatment
indicating pregnancy. In all six aflibercept-treated animals, progesterone
secretion was suppressed in the treatment cycle and a CG rise did not occur by
Day 30. Pregnancy was delayed to the next cycle, significantly extending
interbirth interval compared to controls. Posttreatment deliveries and infant
development were normal.
CONCLUSION: These results show that stringent pharmacological inhibition of VEGF 
suppresses luteal progesterone and prevents the successful establishment of
pregnancy.

1. Roles of human cytochrome P450 (P450) 3A4 in oxidation of an antihistaminic
drug terfenadine have been previously investigated in association with
terfenadine-ketoconazole interaction. Several antihistamine drugs have been
recently identified as substrates for multiple P450 enzymes. In this study,
overall roles of P450 3A4, 2J2, and 4F12 enzymes in terfenadine t-butyl
hydroxylation were investigated in small intestines and livers from humans,
marmosets, and/or cynomolgus monkeys. 2. Human liver microsomes and liver and
small intestine microsomes from marmosets and cynomolgus monkeys effectively
mediated terfenadine t-butyl hydroxylation. Ketoconazole and
N-hydroxy-N'-(4-butyl-2-methylphenyl)-formamidine (a P450 4A/F inhibitor) almost 
completely and moderately inhibited these activities, respectively, in human
liver microsomes; however, these chemicals did not show substantially suppression
in marmoset liver. Anti-human P450 3A and 4F antibodies showed the roughly
supportive inhibitory effects. 3. Recombinant P450 3A4/90 and 4F12 showed high
terfenadine t-butyl hydroxylation activities with substrate inhibition constants 
of 84-144 μM (under 26-76 μM of Km values), in similar manners to liver and
intestine microsomes. 4. These results suggest that human and marmoset P450
3A4/90 and 4F12 in livers or small intestines played important roles in
terfenadine t-butyl hydroxylation. Marmosets could be a model for humans during
first pass extraction of terfenadine and related substrates.

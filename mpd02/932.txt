Vocalizations of human infants undergo dramatic changes across the first year by 
becoming increasingly mature and speech-like. Human vocal development is
partially dependent on learning by imitation through social feedback between
infants and caregivers. Recent studies revealed similar developmental processes
being influenced by parental feedback in marmoset monkeys for apparently innate
vocalizations. Marmosets produce infant-specific vocalizations that disappear
after the first postnatal months. However, it is yet unclear whether parental
feedback is an obligate requirement for proper vocal development. Using
quantitative measures to compare call parameters and vocal sequence structure we 
show that, in contrast to normally raised marmosets, marmosets that were
separated from parents after the third postnatal month still produced
infant-specific vocal behaviour at subadult stages. These findings suggest a
significant role of social feedback on primate vocal development until the
subadult stages and further show that marmoset monkeys are a compelling model
system for early human vocal development.

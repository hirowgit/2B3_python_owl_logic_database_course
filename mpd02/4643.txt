normotensive animals and man.

The role of the renin-angiotensin system in the control of blood pressure in
normal rodents, primates and man has been evaluated using inhibitors which block 
the system at various stages. Renin plays a major role in the maintenance of
blood pressure under volume depletion. In subjects with a normal salt intake, the
contribution of the renin-angiotensin system in maintaining blood pressure levels
can be evaluated using angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. The
contribution of the renin-angiotensin system can now be evaluated more closely
following the development of new substances which block the renin-angiotensinogen
reaction. Available data strongly suggest that renin contributes to the
maintenance of blood pressure levels in subjects with a normal salt intake,
although to a lesser degree than in subjects on a low sodium intake. The
renin-angiotensin system plays a role in the regulation of blood pressure levels 
in normal experimental animals and man--its importance depending on the state of 
sodium balance.

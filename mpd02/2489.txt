New World monkeys represent an important but often poorly understood research
resource. The relatively small size and low zoonotic risk of these animals make
them appealing as research subjects in a number of areas. However, historic
portrayal of many of these species as difficult to manage and handle is one of
the factors that has limited their use. Basic guidelines are provided on
management and handling approaches for the New World monkeys most commonly used
in research: marmosets, squirrel monkeys, owl monkeys, and titi monkeys. Topics
include transport and acclimation to a new facility, location changes within a
facility, diet changes, removal from and return to social groups, capture and
restraint, handling for anesthesia, postprocedural monitoring, and staff
training.

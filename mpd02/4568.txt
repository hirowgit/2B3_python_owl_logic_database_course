Learning impairment following lesion of the basal nucleus of Meynert in the
marmoset: modification by cholinergic drugs.

Ridley RM, Murray TK, Johnson JA, Baker HF.

Five common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) received unilateral ibotenic acid
lesions of the basal nucleus of Meynert (nBM). Seven days later, choline
acetyltransferase activity was significantly reduced by 50% in the frontal and
temporal neocortex, 40% in the amygdala, and approximately 30% in the motor,
parietal and occipital cortex in the ipsilateral hemisphere. Four marmosets
receiving equivalent bilateral ibotenic acid lesions were severely impaired on
new visual object discrimination learning and on relearning an object
discrimination learnt prior to surgery when compared with operated controls. New 
learning in lesioned animals was substantially improved by i.m. administration of
the cholinergic agonist arecoline. Lesioned animals' learning ability improved
with time but these animals were then differentially sensitive to the disruptive 
effect of scopolamine on discrimination learning. These results show that lesions
of the nBM which destroy the rising cholinergic pathways impair learning ability 
but that this ability can be substantially restored by administration of a
cholinergic agonist.

Typically, cognitive abilities of humans have been attributed to their greatly
expanded cortical mantle, granular prefrontal cortex (gPFC) in particular.
Recently we have demonstrated systematic differences in microstructure of gPFC in
different species. Specifically, pyramidal cells in adult human gPFC are
considerably more spinous than those in the gPFC of the macaque monkey, which are
more spinous than those in the gPFC of marmoset and owl monkeys. As most cortical
dendritic spines receive at least one excitatory input, pyramidal cells in these 
different species putatively receive different numbers of inputs. These
differences in the gPFC pyramidal cell phenotype may be of fundamental importance
in determining the functional characteristics of prefrontal circuitry and hence
the cognitive styles of the different species. However, it remains unknown as to 
why the gPFC pyramidal cell phenotype differs between species. Differences could 
be attributed to, among other things, brain size, relative size of gPFC, or the
lineage to which the species belong. Here we investigated pyramidal cells in the 
dorsolateral gPFC of the prosimian galago to extend the basis for comparison. We 
found these cells to be less spinous than those in human, macaque, and marmoset.

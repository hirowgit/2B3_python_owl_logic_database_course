Callitrichid hepatitis is an arenavirus infection that recently emerged as a
highly fatal disease of New World primates in the Callitrichidae family. As we
previously reported, these primates develop hepatitis after contact with mice
that are infected with variants of LCMV (LVMCCH), recently determined to have 86%
identity with GC-P gene of the Armstrong and Western strains of LCMV. Here, we
describe the histopathological lesions and tissue localization of viral antigens 
in confirmed cases of callitrichid hepatitis from recent outbreaks in two U.S.
zoos. The liver in marmosets and tamarins with fatal infections consistently
showed degeneration, necrosis, and inflammation, with variable involvement of the
spleen, lymph nodes, adrenal glands, intestine, pancreas, and central nervous
system. Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus antigens were identified
immunohistochemically in necrotic foci in these organs as well as in
nondegenerating areas in lungs, kidney, urinary bladder, brain, and testes. The
multi-organ tropism and histological pattern of LCMV infection in marmosets and
tamarins are similar to those reported for the highly virulent arenavirus that
causes Lassa fever in humans. Comparative studies of callitrichid hepatitis and
Lassa fever would therefore be mutually beneficial for human and nonhuman primate
medicine.

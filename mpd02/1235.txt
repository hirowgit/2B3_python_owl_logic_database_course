Shortening the lengthy treatment duration for tuberculosis patients is a major
goal of current drug development efforts. The common marmoset develops human-like
disease pathology and offers an attractive model to better understand the basis
for relapse and test regimens for effective shorter duration therapy. We treated 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis-infected marmosets with two drug regimens known to
differ in their relapse rates in human clinical trials: the standard four-drug
combination of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol (HRZE) that has 
very low relapse rates and the combination of isoniazid and streptomycin that is 
associated with higher relapse rates. As early as 2 weeks, the more sterilizing
regimen significantly reduced the volume of lung disease by computed tomography
(P = 0.035) and also significantly reduced uptake of
[(18)F]-2-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose by positron emission tomography (P = 0.049).
After 6 weeks of therapy, both treatments caused similar reductions in granuloma 
bacterial load, but the more sterilizing, four-drug regimen caused greater
reduction in bacterial load in cavitary lesions (P = 0.009). These findings,
combined with the association in humans between cavitary disease and relapse,
suggest that the basis for improved sterilizing activity of the four-drug
combination is both its faster disease volume resolution and its stronger
sterilizing effect on cavitary lesions. Definitive data from relapse experiments 
are needed to support this observation.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a human herpesvirus that efficiently transforms and
immortalizes human primary B lymphocytes. In this study, the role of latent
membrane protein 2 (LMP2) in EBV growth transformation was investigated. LMP2 is 
a virally encoded membrane protein expressed in EBV-immortalized B cells
previously shown to be nonessential for EBV transformation. However, a recent
study reported that LMP2 may be an important determinant for efficient B cell
transformation (Brielmeier et al., Journal of General Virology 77, 2807-2818,
1996). In this study a deletion mutation was introduced into the LMP2 gene using 
an E. coli mini-EBV construct containing sufficient EBV DNA to result in growth
transformation of primary B cells. In an alternative approach, the introduction
of the gene encoding the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) by homologous 
recombination into the LMP2 gene of EBV strain B95-8, generating the same LMP2
deletion mutation is reported. Careful quantification of B cell transformation
using the EGFP+ LMP2- recombinant virus determined that in liquid culture medium 
or in culture medium containing soft agarose there was no difference in the
ability of LMP2- virus to immortalize primary human B cells when compared to that
of wild-type virus.

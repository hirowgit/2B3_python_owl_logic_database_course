Decision making often involves choosing between small, short-term rewards and
large, long-term rewards. All animals, humans included, discount future
rewards--the present value of delayed rewards is viewed as less than the value of
immediate rewards. Despite its ubiquity, there exists considerable but
unexplained variation between species in their capacity to wait for rewards--that
is, to exert patience or self-control. Using two closely related primates--common
marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) and cotton-top tamarins (Saguinus oedipus)--we
uncover a variable that may explain differences in how species discount future
rewards. Both species faced a self-control paradigm in which individuals chose
between taking an immediate small reward and waiting a variable amount of time
for a large reward. Under these conditions, marmosets waited significantly longer
for food than tamarins. This difference cannot be explained by life history,
social behaviour or brain size. It can, however, be explained by feeding ecology:
marmosets rely on gum, a food product acquired by waiting for exudate to flow
from trees, whereas tamarins feed on insects, a food product requiring impulsive 
action. Foraging ecology, therefore, may provide a selective pressure for the
evolution of self-control.

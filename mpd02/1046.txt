BACKGROUND: Common marmosets are extensively used in immunological and
pharmacological research, and the usage of methods such as flow cytometry gain
increasing importance.
METHODS: Using multicolor flow cytometry cross-reactivity of monoclonal
antibodies with cells of common marmosets was analyzed. Furthermore, frequencies 
of immune cells and immunological parameters were assessed in healthy common
marmosets.
RESULTS: A total of 97 clones of monoclonal antibodies raised against CD markers,
chemokine receptors, and miscellaneous markers were tested. Additionally,
baseline frequencies of different innate and adaptive immune cells as well as
certain parameters, such as activation and memory T-cell and B-cell distribution,
are provided.
CONCLUSION: Our study gives an extended overview of cross-reactive antibodies for
flow cytometric analysis of immune cells as well as baseline values for different
immune parameters in healthy common marmosets.

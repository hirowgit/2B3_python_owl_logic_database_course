Nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems have been intensively investigated,
while only a few of them can be used for clinic application. Hematoporphyrin
(HP), a major molecule in erythrocyte, has been widely used in photodynamic
therapy (PDT). In the present study, polyethylene glycol (PEG) modified
hematoporphyrin (HPP)-based nanoparticle system was designed to load doxorubicin 
(HPPD), in achieving a synergistic effect of chemotherapy and PDT. Herein we
presented that HPPD formed narrowly dispersed nanoparticles at 35 ± 2 nm,
yielding an enhanced drug release at pH5.8 along with laser radiation. This
combined treatment with HPPD and radiation facilitated drug penetration to the
nucleus thereby reducing 12-fold decrease in IC50 value and promoting apoptosis
in drug-resistant breast cancer cells. Notably, little toxicity was detected with
HPP at the cellular level and in animal models. Live animal imaging revealed that
HPPD performed ultra high tumor uptake in both mice and marmoset models.
Strikingly, intravenous administration of HPPD and radiation on the tumor
achieved efficient tumor ablation, without inducing myocardial injury. We report 
here the development of a biomolecule, HP-based nanoparticle system, which can
synergistically yield chemotherapy and PDT.

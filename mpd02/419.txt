Across vertebrates, progressive changes in vocal behavior during postnatal
development are typically attributed solely to developing neural circuits. How
the changing body influences vocal development remains unknown. Here we show that
state changes in the contact vocalizations of infant marmoset monkeys, which
transition from noisy, low frequency cries to tonal, higher pitched vocalizations
in adults, are caused partially by laryngeal development. Combining analyses of
natural vocalizations, motorized excised larynx experiments, tensile material
tests and high-speed imaging, we show that vocal state transition occurs via a
sound source switch from vocal folds to apical vocal membranes, producing louder 
vocalizations with higher efficiency. We show with an empiricallyÂ based model of 
descending motor control how neural circuits could interact with changing
laryngeal dynamics, leading to adaptive vocal development. Our results emphasize 
the importance of embodied approaches to vocal development, where exploiting
biomechanical consequences of changing material properties can simplify motor
control, reducing the computational load on the developing brain.

1. Hydrogen peroxide-induced haemolysis (HPIH) was studied in the red blood cells
of the common marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus) in relation to the composition
of the membrane fatty acids. HPIH (%) was surprisingly high (mean 41% +/- 34;
median 33.4%) and significantly different (P less than 0.001) from the
corresponding value in healthy human subjects (mean 0.98% +/- 0.6; median 1.3%). 
2. It was negatively correlated with 18:2n-6 (r = -0.76, P less than 0.001),
18:2n-6/20:4n-6 (r = -0.70, P less than 0.005) and 18:2n-6/22:6n-3 (r = -0.44, P 
less than 0.025) in the ethanolamine phosphoglycerides of the erythrocytes. 3. A 
shift in the n-6/n-3 balance in favour of the n-3 in the fatty acid composition
of the membrane may have predisposed the red blood cells to haemolysis. 4. An
increase in 22:6n-3, and a decrease of 20:4n-6 and 18:2n-6, may have been the
result of feeding a diet containing fish products rich in long chain n-3 fatty
acids.

jacchus).

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) can be obtained routinely from the common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus) by suboccipital puncture. One field of research in which
this method is applied is the detection of changes in the biogenic amine
metabolism in CSF. The puncture technique is simple and rapid and does not injure
the experimental animal.

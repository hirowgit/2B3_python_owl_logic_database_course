We evaluated whether the marmoset, a nonhuman primate, can serve as a good model 
to study aging-related changes in the kidney by employing healthy young and aged 
marmosets of both sexes. Aging was associated with glomerulosclerosis,
interstitial fibrosis, and arteriolosclerosis in both sexes; correspondingly, the
content of matrix proteins was increased. Functionally, aging resulted in an
increase in urinary albumin and protein excretion. There was a robust correlation
between markers of fibrosis and functional changes. We explored signaling
pathways as potential mechanistic events. Aging in males, but not in females, was
associated with reduced renal cortical activity of AMP-activated protein kinase
(AMPK) and a trend toward activation of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1
(mTORC1); upstream of AMPK and mTORC1, Akt and IGF-1 receptor were activated. In 
both sexes, aging promoted kidney activation of transforming growth factor β-1
signaling pathway. While the expression of cystathionine β-synthase (CBS), an
enzyme involved hydrogen sulfide (H2S) synthesis, was reduced in both aged males 
and females, decreased H2S generation was seen in only males. Our studies show
that the marmoset is a valid model to study kidney aging; some of the signaling
pathways involved in renal senescence differ between male and female marmosets.

In order to evaluate Callithrix jacchus as an animal model for mansoni
schistosomiasis, a group of 10 male animals were once percutaneously exposed to
250 cercariae of the Schistosoma mansoni SLM (São Lourenço da Mata) strain.
Animals were periodically bled for measuring serum level of enzymes and proteins 
and for blood cell counting. When comparing pre-infection to post-infection
values, a significant increase was found for alkaline phosphatase at 15 to 120
days p.i., differential counts of eosinophil at 45 and 60 days, and total protein
and global eosinophil counts at 120 days. No Schistosoma mansoni eggs were found 
in stools. Adult worms of small size were recovered from five animals. At day
120, the number of Schistosoma mansoni eggs/g of tissue was 0-289.7 (liver),
0-30.1 (large intestine) and 0-171.4 (small intestine). These findings lead us to
classify Callithrix jacchus as a non-permissive host to the SLM strain of
Schistosoma mansoni.

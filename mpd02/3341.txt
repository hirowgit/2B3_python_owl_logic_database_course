The orbitofrontal cortex has been ascribed a role in the inhibitory control, as
well as in the emotional control, of behaviour. While damage to the orbitofrontal
cortex in humans and non-human primates can cause inflexibility, impulsiveness
and emotional disturbance, the relationship between these effects are unclear.
Excitotoxic lesion studies in marmosets comparing the effects of cell loss within
specific regions of the prefrontal cortex on performance of a range of
behavioural tests reveal that mechanisms of response inhibition are not unique to
the orbitofrontal cortex. Instead they are present in distinct cognitive domains 
for lowerorder as well as higher-order processing throughout the prefrontal
cortex. Thus, the lateral prefrontal cortex is involved in the selection and
control of action based upon higher-order rules while the orbitofrontal and
medial prefrontal cortex may be involved in different but complementary forms of 
lower-order rule learning, their roles dissociable, as a result of their
differential contribution to different types of associative learning.

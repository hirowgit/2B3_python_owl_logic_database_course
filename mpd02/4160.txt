Field isolates of measles virus (MV) during an 8-year period in four areas of
Japan, i.e., Osaka, Nagoya, Tokyo and Akita, were classified into three types in 
regard to the electrophoretic mobility of the hemagglutinin (HA) proteins: S type
with small (78K) HA, M type with intermediate (80 K) HA and L type with large (82
K) HA. The type of field isolates was closely related with the geographical
location and the year of virus isolation. The S type strain was isolated only in 
an outbreak from 1983 to 1984, whereas the M and L type strains were isolated
between 1983 and 1990. The HA genes of the M and L type strains of MV were found 
to have a nucleotide substitution which introduces a new potential glycosylation 
site. In addition, the matrix proteins of all field strains isolated after 1977
showed slower electrophoretic mobility of 42 K than 39 K of the Edmonston and
Toyoshima strains. These results indicate that MV strains of different HA types
existed concomitantly and that major populations of MV currently circulating in
Japan are changing from those prevalent in 1983-1984.

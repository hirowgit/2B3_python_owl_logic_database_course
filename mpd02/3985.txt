Eight isolates of canine distemper virus (CDV) were obtained from seven dogs
suffering from distemper by co-cultivation of their mononuclear cells with a
marmoset B lymphoblastoid cell line, B95a. Six of the seven dogs had received one
or more vaccinations. All of the isolates readily proliferated in B95a cells, but
were not completely neutralized by anti-CDV canine plasma, which had high
neutralizing activity against the Onderstepoort laboratory strain of CDV.
Furthermore, different reactivities of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against CDV
were observed between the field isolates and laboratory or vaccine strains of CDV
in immunofluorescence studies. Immunoprecipitation analysis using MAbs detected
the haemagglutinin protein of each new field isolate as 69K, 75K and 155K forms, 
and the fusion protein as 64K and 65K forms; the corresponding proteins of the
Onderstepoort strain were detected as 75K and 61K proteins respectively. It is
apparent from these results that the new field isolates of CDV have very
different antigenic properties from the Onderstepoort vaccine strain.

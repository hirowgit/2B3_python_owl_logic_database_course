Nitrogen balance studies were conducted in adult male marmosets (Callithrix
jacchus) using purified and semipurified diets with protein levels between 0% and
7%. Daily nitrogen loss in a state of prolonged protein free nutrition was 131
+/- 16 mg/kg body weight0.75. Zero nitrogen balance resulted from mean daily
intake of 261 mg nitrogen/kg0.75 when high quality protein sources were used.
Very low protein intake or the lack of arginine and histidine in an amino acid
mixture induced coprophagy. It is concluded that the protein requirement of adult
marmosets is very similar to the protein requirement of adult humans (based on
metabolic body weight). About 6-7% high quality protein, based on dry matter,
suffice to avoid a negative nitrogen balance in all individuals.

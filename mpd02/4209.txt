Biopterin, 6-hydroxymethyl-pterin, isoxanthopterin, neopterin and, pterin were
quantified in stress-free collected spontaneous morning urine samples from
Callithrix jacchus, Saguinus fuscicollis, Saguinus labiatus, Saimiri sciureus,
Presbytis entellus, Cercopithecus albogularis, Cercocebus torquatus, Macaca
fascicularis, Hylobates concolor, Pongo pygmaeus, and Gorilla gorilla. In most
species, biopterin was the most frequent urinary pteridine followed by neopterin.
Sex differences in biopterin and neopterin excretion were observed in Gorilla
gorilla and Pongo pygmaeus. Pterin and isoxanthopterin were only present in minor
concentrations. 6-hydroxymethyl-pterin was barely detectable and not present in
the urine of Saguinus labiatus, Saimiri sciureus, and both male Gorilla gorilla
and Pongo pygmaeus.

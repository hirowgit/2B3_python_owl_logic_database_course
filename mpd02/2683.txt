It has been well documented that neurons in the auditory cortex of anaesthetized 
animals generally display transient responses to acoustic stimulation, and
typically respond to a brief stimulus with one or fewer action potentials. The
number of action potentials evoked by each stimulus usually does not increase
with increasing stimulus duration. Such observations have long puzzled
researchers across disciplines and raised serious questions regarding the role of
the auditory cortex in encoding ongoing acoustic signals. Contrary to these
long-held views, here we show that single neurons in both primary (area A1) and
lateral belt areas of the auditory cortex of awake marmoset monkeys (Callithrix
jacchus) are capable of firing in a sustained manner over a prolonged period of
time, especially when they are driven by their preferred stimuli. In contrast,
responses become more transient or phasic when auditory cortex neurons respond to
non-preferred stimuli. These findings suggest that when the auditory cortex is
stimulated by a sound, a particular population of neurons fire maximally
throughout the duration of the sound. Responses of other, less optimally driven
neurons fade away quickly after stimulus onset. This results in a selective
representation of the sound across both neuronal population and time.

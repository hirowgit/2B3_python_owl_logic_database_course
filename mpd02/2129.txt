The aim of this study was to label selectively and to map central vasopressin
(AVP) and oxytocin (OT) binding sites in the common marmoset. [(125)I]VPA, a
compound selective in rodents and human for the AVP V(1a) receptor, yielded the
same labeling pattern as [(3)H]AVP, thus suggesting that most AVP receptors
present in the marmoset brain are of the V(1a) subtype. Numerous areas exhibited 
AVP binding sites, among which the olfactory bulb, the accumbens nucleus, the bed
nucleus of the stria terminalis, the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic, arcuate and
ventromedial nuclei, the medial amygdaloid nucleus, the nucleus of the solitary
tract and the cerebral cortex. Binding sites for [(125)I]OTA, a selective OT
receptor antagonist in rat and human, were markedly less abundant than
[(125)I]VPA ones, and, to a few exceptions, expressed in different areas. Neither
AVP, nor OT binding sites were detected in the hypothalamic paraventricular (PVN)
and supraoptic (SON) nuclei identified by neurophysin immunoreactivity. Marked
species-related differences were observed in the distribution of both AVP and OT 
binding sites. Altogether, our data provide a morphological basis to investigate 
the function of central AVP and OT in the marmoset.

Susceptibility of common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) to oncogenic and
attenuated strains of Herpesvirus saimiri.

Wright J, Falk LA, Wolfe LG, Ogden J, Deinhardt F.

Adult common marmosets, inoculated with either of 2 oncogenic Herpesvirus saimiri
(HVS) strains, developed fatal lymphoproliferative disease within 23-25 days post
inoculation (PI). The disease was identical to HVS-induced lymphoma in
cotton-topped and white-lipped marmosets. Common marmosets inoculated with an
attenuated HVS strain developed persistent infection; virus has been recovered
from cocultivated lymphocytes of these animals for more than 384 days PI.

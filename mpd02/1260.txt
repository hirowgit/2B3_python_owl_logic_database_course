Callithrix jacchus (common marmoset) is a New World primate monkey, used as an
animal model in biomedical research. Marmoset-specific follicle-stimulating
hormone (FSH) preparation is required to improve superovulation protocols and to 
develop homologous FSH monitoring assays in these monkeys. In this study, we
document the large-scale expression of recombinant marmoset FSH in methylotropic 
yeast, Pichia pastoris. The recombinant preparation was found to be
immunologically active in Western blotting and radioimmunoassay. The preparation 
displayed receptor binding ability in radioreceptor assay. Based on the receptor 
binding ability, the yield of fermentation was estimated to be 7.2 mg/L.
FSH-induced cAMP assay and estradiol assay revealed that the recombinant hormone 
is able to induce signal transduction. Both immunological and in vitro biological
activity of marmoset FSH was found to be comparable to purified human pituitary
FSH, which served as reference hormone for these assays. Thus, the study suggests
that a Pichia expression system can be used for large-scale expression of
bioactive recombinant marmoset FSH.

Thalidomide (Thd) is capable of down-regulating the CD26 receptor on CD4+
lymphocytes after treatment of healthy volunteers. Similar effects are observed
when marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) are treated with Thd. The Ta1 epitope of the 
CD26 receptor has recently been shown to bind the HIV-1 Tat trans-activating
protein, and CD26 has also been suggested to be a coreceptor for the binding of
the V3 loop of the gp120 HIV envelope protein. This might provide a hint for
possible therapeutic interventions.

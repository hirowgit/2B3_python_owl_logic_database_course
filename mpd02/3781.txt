The discovery that myopia can be induced in animals has resulted in renewed
interest in the condition and it is hoped that information gained about the
production, manipulation and prevention of myopia in animals might provide
information about naturally occurring myopia in humans. Early experimental work
was carried out using monkeys as subjects, but the high cost involved, and the
difficulty of obtaining monkeys in adequate numbers for good experimental design 
and control, made researchers look for more suitable experimental animals. Myopia
has also been induced in other animals species such as the domestic cat, the tree
shrew, the marmoset, the guinea pig and, most successfully, the domestic chicken.
The parallels between experimentally induced myopia, which can only be induced in
infant animals, and human myopia which typically develops well after infancy,
have still to be established.

New World monkeys have polymorphic color vision, in which all males and some
females are dichromats, while most females are trichromats. There is little
consensus about which selective pressures fashioned primate color vision,
although detection of food, mates and predators has been hypothesized. Behavioral
evidence shows that males from different species of Neotropical primates seem to 
perceive the timing of female conception and gestation, although, no signals
fulfilling this function have been identified. Therefore, we used visual models
to test the hypothesis that female marmosets show chromatic and/or achromatic
cues that may indicate the time of parturition for male and female conspecifics. 
By recording the reflectance spectra of female marmosets' (Callithrix jacchus)
sexual skin, and running chromatic and achromatic discrimination models, we found
that both variables fluctuate during the weeks that precede and succeed
parturition, forming "U" and inverted "U" patterns for chromatic and achromatic
contrast, respectively. We suggest that variation in skin chroma and luminance
might be used by female helpers and dominant females to identify the timing of
birth, while achromatic variations may be used as clues by potential fathers to
identify pregnancy stage in females and prepare for paternal burdens as well as
to detect oestrus in the early post-partum period.

The karyotypes of three species of marmosets of the Callithrix argentata group
(C. argentata, C. humeralifera and C. chrysoleuca) were studied. Comparisons were
made among species and with the previously described karyotypes of C. emiliae, C.
mauesi (argentata group) and C. jacchus (jacchus group). Two chromosomes
rearrangements differentiate the argentata (2n=44) and jacchus (2n=46) groups:
fusion or fission and a paracentric invasion. The argentata group is also
characterized by the addition of large amounts of distal constitutive
heterochromatin (CH) in some chromosomes, while the jacchus group shows mainly
centromeric heterochromatin. The five species of the argentata group differ in
the amount or location of the distal CH. Interspecific differences were converted
to a Basic Data Matrix (BDM), that was submitted to phenetic and cladistic
analyses. For cladistic analyses C. jacchus was the outgroup. The results agree
with morphological and geographical data.

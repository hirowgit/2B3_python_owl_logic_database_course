Mercapturic acid formation in the marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).

Hall BE, James SP.

Benzylmercapturic acid is a major metabolite of [methylene-14C]benzyl chloride in
the marmoset, as in the rat. The excretion of the minor metabolites
benzylmercapturic acid sulphoxide and benzylcysteine accounted for a greater
proportion of the dose than in the rat. Excretion of hippuric acid as a
metabolite of benzyl chloride was variable in the marmoset. Acetylation of
S-benzyl- and S-pentyl-L-cysteine to the corresponding mercapturic acids was
extensive in the marmoset. Trace amounts of the sulphoxides of these acids were
also excreted.

Ninety-two bifidobacterial strains were obtained from the faeces of 5 baby common
marmosets, three known species Bifidobacterium aesculapii, Bifidobacterium
callithricos and Bifidobacterium reuteri and 4 novel putative bifidobacterial
species were retrieved. The occurrence of bifidobacteria in non-human primate
babies is described for the first time.

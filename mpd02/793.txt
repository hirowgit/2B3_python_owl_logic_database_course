1. Simulated clearances of R-warfarin and efavirenz were recently reported for
individual cynomolgus monkeys genotyped for cytochrome P450 2C19 and 2C9,
respectively. To expand and verify this modeling procedure, simulations of
R/S-omeprazole and R/S-warfarin clearances after oral administrations in
individual marmosets were performed using individual simplified physiologically
based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling consisting of gut, liver and central
compartments. 2. Pharmacokinetics of R/S-omeprazole were chirally determined
using the previously reported plasma microsamples in this study. The areas under 
the plasma concentration/time curves (AUC) of R-omeprazole and S-warfarin, but
not S-omeprazole and R-warfarin, after oral administrations in the P450 2C19
homozygous mutant group were significantly higher than those in the wild-type
group. These modeled hepatic intrinsic clearances were also significantly
associated with the marmoset P450 2C19 genotypes. Other parameter values, e.g.
absorption rate constants or systemic circulation volumes, were not likely
determining factors. 3. The reported individual AUC values measured in 4-6
marmosets after oral R-omeprazole and S-warfarin administrations were
significantly correlated with the AUC values predicted using the PBPK models
after virtual administrations. 4. This study indicates that clearances of
R-omeprazole, S-warfarin and related medicines associated with polymorphic P450
2C19 in individual marmosets can be simulated using simplified individual PBPK
models.

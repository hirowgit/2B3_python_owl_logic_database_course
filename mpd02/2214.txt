Callithrix jacchus, the common marmoset, is a small new world primate that is
considered effective as an experimental animal model for various human diseases. 
In this study, we generated monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against common marmoset 
lymphocytes for immunological studies on the common marmoset. We established five
hybridoma clones, 6C9, 10D7, 6F10, 7A4 and 5A1, producing anti-marmoset mAbs
against cell surface antigens on marmoset T and/or B lymphocytes. We confirmed
that 6C9 and 10D7 antibodies recognized CD45 antigen, and 6F10 antibody
recognized CD8 antigen by flow cytometry using marmoset cDNA transfectants. We
also tested them for application of immunoprecipitation, Western blot analysis
and immunohistochemistry. We found that immunohistochemistry using marmoset
spleen sections could be applied with all established mAbs but
immunoprecipitation and the Western blot analysis could be applied with 6F10 and 
10D7 antibodies but not with the other three mAbs. These results show that these 
monoclonal antibodies are useful for advancing immunological research on the
common marmoset.

PURPOSE: The lacrimal gland is often selected for microscopic examination in
toxicologic studies. However, this gland is difficult to find within the orbit in
marmosets at necropsy. Therefore, we examined the extraorbital lacrimal glands in
marmosets.
METHODS: The formalin-fixed craniums of four marmosets were used in a topographic
study to confirm location of the lacrimal gland, and the results were applied to 
a routine toxicologic study in marmosets.
RESULTS: The extraorbital lacrimal gland was located on the temporal surface of
the zygomaticofrontal process and was covered with the temporalis muscle. The
gland was easily detached from the surrounding tissue, and its histologic
features were the same as those of the intraorbital lacrimal gland.
CONCLUSIONS: The extraorbital lacrimal glands have been reported in some New
World monkeys, but to the authors' knowledge, this is the first report in
marmosets. Identification and characterization of this gland will be useful for
toxicologic studies in marmosets.

Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) has previously reduced motor
deficits and preserved nigral dopamine neurones in rhesus monkeys with a
unilateral MPTP-induced lesion of substantia nigra. We now report on the ability 
of GDNF to reverse motor deficits induced by parenteral administration of
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) to common marmosets resulting
in bilateral degeneration of the nigrostriatal pathway. Prior to GDNF
administration, all MPTP-treated animals showed akinesia or bradykinesia,
rigidity, postural instability and tremor. Intraventricular injection of GDNF
(10, 100 or 500 microg) at 9 and 13 weeks post MPTP treatment resulted in a
concentration dependent improvement in locomotor activity and motor disability
which became significant after administration of 100 and 500 microg of GDNF. The 
most prominent improvements were in alertness, checking movements, and posture.
It is concluded that intraventricular GDNF administration improves bilateral
Parkinsonian motor disability following MPTP treatment and this may reflect an
action of GDNF on remaining nigral dopaminergic neurones.

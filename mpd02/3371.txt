Primate pericentromeric regions recently have been shown to exhibit extraordinary
evolutionary plasticity. In this paper we report an additional peculiar feature
of these regions that we discovered while analyzing, by FISH, the evolutionary
conservation of primate phylogenetic chromosome IX. If the position of the
centromere is not taken into account, a relatively small number of rearrangements
must be invoked to account for interspecific differences. Conversely, if the
centromere is included, a paradox emerges: The position of the centromere seems
to have undergone, in some species, an evolutionary history independent from the 
surrounding markers. A significant number of additional rearrangements must be
proposed to reconcile the order of the markers with centromere position.
Alternatively, the evolutionary emergence of neocentromeres can be postulated.

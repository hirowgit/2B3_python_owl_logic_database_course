Mother-infant interaction in common marmosets ( Callithrix jacchus jacchus ) was 
scored for the first 60 days post parturition. Teat preference was compared to
hand preference for picking up and holding food over the same ages and at 18
months. All infants, except one, exhibited strong preferences for one of the
mother's teats. Preference for a teat was maintained when twins suckled
separately as well as together. Infants suckled separately for a mean 42% of the 
time of all suckling bouts being observed. There was a significant correlation
between teat preference and the side of being carried by the mother. This
correlation was maintained despite the fact that the father also carried the
infants. There was no significant relationship between teat preference and hand
preference from 0 to 2 months or later life.

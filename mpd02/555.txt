PURPOSE: Ex vivo brains have different MRI properties than in vivo brains because
of chemical changes caused by fixative solutions, which change the signal
intensity and/or tissue contrast on MR images. In this study, we investigated and
compared the MRI properties of in vivo and ex vivo brains.
METHODS: Using a Bruker 9.4T experimental scanner unit for animals (Biospin GmbH,
Ettlingen, Germany), we performed this study on the common marmoset. We measured 
the relaxation and diffusion values in the white matter and cortex of common
marmosets and compared these values between in vivo brains (n = 20) and ex vivo
brains (n = 20). Additionally, we observed the relationship between the tissue
fixation duration and MRI properties by imaging a brain that underwent long-term 
fixation in a preliminary examination (n = 1).
RESULTS: The T1 values of ex vivo brains were decreased compared with those of in
vivo brains; however, there were no significant difference in the T2 and T2*
values of in vivo and ex vivo brains. Axial, radial, and mean diffusivity values 
of ex vivo brains decreased to approximately 65% and 52% of those of in vivo
brains in the cortex and white matter, respectively. Conversely, fractional
anisotropy values were not significantly different between in vivo and ex vivo
brains.
CONCLUSION: The T1 values and diffusion coefficient values of the ex vivo brains 
were strikingly different than those of the in vivo brains. Conversely, there
were no significant changes in the T2, T2* or fractional anisotropy values.
Altogether, the dehydration caused by tissue fixation and the reduction in brain 
temperature were involved in changing the relaxation and diffusion coefficient
values. Here, it was difficult to specify all factors causing these changes.
Further detailed study is needed to examine changes in MRI properties.

Recent advances in single-cell RNA sequencing have enabled the molecular
distinction of ganglion cell populations in mammalian retinas. Here we used
antibodies against the transcription factor special AT-rich binding protein 1
(Satb1, a protein which is expressed by on-off direction-selective ganglion cells
in mouse retina) to study Satb1 expression in the retina of marmosets (Callithrix
jacchus), macaques (Macaca fascicularis), and humans. In all species, Satb1 was
exclusively expressed in retinal ganglion cells. The Satb1 cells made up ∼2% of
the ganglion cell population in the central retina of all species, rising to a
maximum ∼7% in peripheral marmoset retina. Intracellular injections in marmoset
and macaque retinas revealed that most Satb1 expressing ganglion cells are
widefield ganglion cells. In marmoset, Satb1 cells have a densely branching
dendritic tree and include broad and narrow thorny, recursive bistratified, and
parasol cells, all of which show some costratification with the outer or inner
cholinergic amacrine cells. The recursive bistratified cells showed the strongest
costratification but did not show extensive cofasciculation as reported for
on-off direction-selective ganglion cells in rabbit and rodent retinas. In
macaque, Satb1 was not expressed in recursive bistratified cells, but in large
sparsely branching cells. Our findings further support the idea that the
expression of transcription factors in retinal ganglion cells is not conserved
across Old World (human and macaque) and New World (marmoset) primates and
provides a further step to link a molecular marker with specific cell types.

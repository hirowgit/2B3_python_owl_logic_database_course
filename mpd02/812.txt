Simian foamy viruses (SFVs) co-evolved with a wide range of Old World and New
World primates (OWPs and NWPs, respectively) and occasionally transmit to humans.
Previous studies of OWPs showed that the predominant site of SFV replication is
the oral mucosa. However, very little is known about SFV viral loads (VLs) in the
oral mucosa or blood of NWPs. NWPs have smaller body sizes, limiting collection
of sufficient whole blood volumes to molecularly detect and quantify SFV. Our
study evaluated the use of noninvasively collected buccal swabs to detect NWP SFV
compared with detection in blood using a new NWP SFV quantitative PCR (qPCR)
assay. Buccal and blood samples were collected from 107 captive NWPs in Brazil
comprising eleven distinct genera at the Primate Center of Rio de Janeiro (n =
58) and at Fundação Jardim Zoológico da Cidade do Rio Janeiro (n = 49). NWP SFV
western blot (WB) testing was performed on a subset of animals for comparison
with PCR results. The qPCR assay was validated using distinct SFV polymerase
sequences from seven NWP genera (Callithrix, Sapajus, Saimiri, Ateles, Alouatta, 
Cacajao and Pithecia). Assay sensitivity was 20 copies/106 cells, detectable in
90% of replicates. SFV DNA VLs were higher in buccal swabs (5 log copies/106
cells) compared to peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) (3 log copies/106
cells). The qPCR assay was also more sensitive than nested PCR for detection of
NWP SFV infection and identified an additional 27 SFV-infected monkeys of which
18 (90%) were WB-positive and three that were WB-negative. We show the utility of
using both blood and buccal swabs and our new qPCR assay for detection and
quantification of diverse NWP SFV, which will assist a better understanding of
the epidemiology of SFV in NWPs and any potential zoonotic infection risk for
humans exposed to NWPs.

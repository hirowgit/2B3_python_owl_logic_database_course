Infanticide has been observed in many different species [1], including common
marmosets [2-4], due to sexual selection, reproductive strategies or resource
competition [3, 5, 6], which may ultimately lead to exploitation (cannibalism)
[1, 7]. Wild callithrichids have a very flexible mating system, including
monogamy, polygynandry, polyandry and polygyny [4, 8, 9], with Monteiro da Cruz
[10] finding all these patterns within the same population. This results from the
high degree of deforestation of their habitat [4], but non-monogamous groups
cannot ensure successful rearing of infants, since helpers are crucial and should
be present in high numbers [11]. In this study, we show for the first time that
cannibalism can follow infanticide, and we hypothesise that it is a result of
both competition for scarce resources and the need for animal protein,
exacerbated by forest degradation.

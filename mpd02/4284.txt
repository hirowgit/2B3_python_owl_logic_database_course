Actinomycetes, involved in oral and periodontal diseases, cause serious
infections in immunocompromised hosts. Severely scorbutic guinea pig leukocytes
killed only 12% of phagocytosed actinomycetes, had distorted nuclear morphology, 
had 16 times less ascorbate, and had no chemotactic responses in vitro. Ascorbate
reversed these indices and also prevented nitrosamine formation by oral
organisms. Degranulating leukocytes release lactoferrin and ascorbate that
chelate iron, essential for microorganisms. Ascorbic acid, 2,2'-bipyridine and
1,10-phenanthroline were bactericidal to several bacterial pathogens at
millimolar concentrations. Iron alone reversed this effect. In in vivo
experiments an Actinomyces viscosus monoflora was implanted in rhesus monkeys.
Plaque and serum samples showed decreased (by six orders of magnitude) bacterial 
counts and decreased actinomycete antibody titers in animals given 1 g
ascorbate/d. Removing ascorbate returned counts and titers to preascorbate
concentrations. Fifteen marmosets, receiving twice daily topical applications of 
ascorbate or water, had comparatively lower gingival, calculus, and plaque
indices and only slightly lowered actinomycete counts.

Cynomolgus macaque (Macaca fascicularis) and common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus)
have been widely used in human biomedical research. Long-standing primate genome 
assemblies used the human genome as a reference for ordering and orienting the
assembled fragments into chromosomes. Here we performed de novo genome assembly
of these two species without any human genome-based bias observed in the genome
assemblies released earlier. We assembled PacBio long reads, and the resultant
contigs were scaffolded with Hi-C data, which were further refined based on Hi-C 
contact maps and alternate de novo assemblies. The assemblies achieved scaffold
N50 lengths of 149 Mb and 137 Mb for cynomolgus macaque and common marmoset,
respectively. The high fidelity of our assembly is also ascertained by BAC-end
concordance in common marmoset. Our assembly of cynomolgus macaque outperformed
all the available assemblies of this species in terms of contiguity. The
chromosome-scale genome assemblies produced in this study are valuable resources 
for non-human primate models and provide an important baseline in human
biomedical research.

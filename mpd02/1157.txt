constrictor: a simultaneous assault on two juvenile monkeys.

Here we report the first witnessed attack on a marmoset by a constrictor snake.
The incident occurred mid-morning in a gallery forest within an altered landscape
of the Cerrado region of central Brazil and refers to a fatal attack by a Boa
constrictor on two juvenile black-tufted-ear marmosets (Callithrix penicillata)
simultaneously. The snake captured both individuals at a height of ~ 4 m while a 
group of eight marmosets traveled through the subcanopy. The actual strike was
not seen. After 2 min, the boa fell to the ground with both marmosets in its
coils and proceeded to kill one animal at a time through constriction. Two adult 
marmosets immediately descended to where the snake held its victims on the ground
and attacked it. The snake showed no apparent reaction, and after ~ 1-2 min, the 
adults rejoined the remaining group members that were mobbing and vocalizing from
5 to 6 m above. The group left the scene ~ 7 min after the onset of the attack
and was not seen again. The snake loosened its coils 10 min after its initial
strike, left the two carcasses on the ground and stayed behind a nearby tree.
Thus, we are not sure if the victims were in fact ingested. This report confirms 
that marmosets are vulnerable to boid snakes and capable of highly organized and 
cooperative antipredation behavior. It also suggests that snakes pose a greater
threat to callitrichids than previously thought.

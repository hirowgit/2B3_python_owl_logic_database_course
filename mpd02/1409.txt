The marmosets and tamarins, Family Callitrichidae, are Neotropical primates with 
over 60 species and subspecies that inhabit much of South America. Although
callitrichids exhibit a remarkable widespread distribution, attempts to unravel
their biogeographic history have been limited by taxonomic confusion and the lack
of an appropriate statistical biogeographic framework. Here, we construct a
time-calibrated multi-locus phylogeny from GenBank data and the callitrichid
literature for 38 taxa. We use this framework to conduct statistical
biogeographic analyses of callitrichids using BioGeoBEARS. The DIVAj model is the
best supported reconstruction of biogeographic history among our analyses and
suggests that the most recent common ancestor to the callitrichids was widespread
across forested regions c. 14 Ma. There is also support for multiple
colonizations of the Atlantic forest region from the Amazon basin, first by
Leontopithecus c. 11 Ma and later by Callithrix c. 5 Ma. Our results show support
for a 9 million year old split between a small-bodied group and large-bodied
group of tamarins. These phylogenetic data, in concert with the consistent
difference in body size between the two groups and geographical patterns
(small-bodied tamarins and large-bodied tamarins have an unusually high degree of
geographic overlap for congeners) lend support to our suggestion to split
Saguinus into two genera, and we propose the use of distinct generic names;
Leontocebus and Saguinus, respectively.

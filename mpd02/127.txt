The midcingulate cortex (MCC) is associated with cognition and emotion
regulation. Structural and correlational functional evidence suggests that rather
than being homogenous, the MCC may have dissociable functions that can be mapped 
onto distinct subregions. In this study, we use the marmoset monkey to causally
investigate the contributions of two proposed subregions of the MCC: the anterior
and posterior midcingulate cortices (aMCC and pMCC) to behavioral and
cardiovascular correlates of threat processing relevant to anxiety disorders.
Transient inactivation of the aMCC decreased anxiety-like responses to a
postencounter distal threat, namely an unfamiliar human intruder, while
inactivation of the pMCC showed a mild but opposing effect. Furthermore, although
inactivation of neither MCC subregions had any effect on basal cardiovascular
activity, aMCC inactivation blunted the expression of both cardiovascular and
behavioral conditioned responses to a predictable proximal threat (a rubber
snake) during the extinction in a Pavlovian conditioning task, with pMCC
inactivation having again an opposing effect, but primarily on the behavioral
response. These findings suggest that the MCC is indeed functionally
heterogeneous with regards to its role in threat processing, with aMCC providing 
a marked facilitative contribution to the expression of the emotional response to
both proximal and distal threat.

The availability of sufficient amounts of spermatozoa of high quality is one of
the main limiting factors in reproductive research and development of
reproductive technologies in marmoset monkeys (Callithrix jacchus). Penile
vibrostimulation (PVS) has been successfully used in semen collection in the
squirrel monkey but with poor success rate in the marmoset. We report here on an 
improved protocol for PVS with a success rate of almost 90%. Ejaculates obtained 
by PVS were of enhanced quality compared with those obtained by rectal probe
electro-ejaculation (RPE). PVS ejaculates contained on average three to fourfold 
higher numbers of total and motile spermatozoa. Assessment of sperm kinematics
using computer-assisted sperm analysis indicated that there are also functional
differences between spermatozoa collected by PVS and RPE. Marmoset spermatozoa in
samples obtained by RPE swim in a more convoluted manner compared with those
obtained by PVS.

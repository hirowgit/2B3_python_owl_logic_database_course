We studied the karyotype of specimens of Callithrix emiliae (Callithricidae,
Primates) from Rondonia, Brazil. Comparison with the karyotype of Callithrix
jacchus showed that, even though these two species show many karyotypic
similarities, they differ by a Robertsonian translocation, a paracentric
inversion and large-scale addition of heterochromatin. The C. emiliae species
appears to be in an active phase of chromosome evolution by the addition of
constitutive heterochromatin.

BACKGROUND: The establishment of reliable methods for functional assessment in
experimental models of peripheral nerve regeneration is crucial.
METHODS: We present a straightforward method for video analysis of the eye blink 
reflex in a model of facial nerve damage in a nonhuman primate (Callithrix sp.).
RESULTS: Our 6-level dynamic analysis demonstrated good reproducibility between
independent observers, as measured by Cohen's kappa index. Our static analysis,
which was based on 4 semiautomated metric parameters, showed low correlation
during the early stage of facial movement recovery (the first and second weeks), 
but the correlation was excellent during the later stage of recovery (the third
and fourth weeks).
CONCLUSION: Altogether, our results establish a viable and readily accessible
method with good reproducibility and correlation for the analysis of functional
facial nerve recovery in an experimental model and based on video images of the
eye blink reflex.

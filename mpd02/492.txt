Background: Parkinson's disease (PD) patients frequently present gastrointestinal
(GI) dysfunction that, in many cases, predates the onset of motor symptoms. In
PD, the presynaptic protein alpha-synuclein (α-syn) undergoes pathological
changes, including phosphorylation and aggregation leading to the formation of
Lewy bodies, which can be found in neurons of the enteric nervous system (ENS).
Inflammation has been proposed as a possible trigger of α-syn pathology.
Interestingly, patients with inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel
syndrome, conditions associated with GI inflammation, are at higher risk of
developing PD. Captive common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) develop colitis,
providing a natural platform to assess the relationship between α-syn pathology
and GI inflammation. Materials and Methods: Sections of proximal colon from
marmosets with colitis (n=5; 5.3±2.3 years old; 4 male) and normal controls (n=5;
4.1±1.6 years old; 1 male) were immunostained against protein gene product 9.5
(PGP9.5), human leukocyte antigen DR (HLA-DR), cluster of differentiation 3
(CD3), cluster of differentiation 20 (CD20), glial fibrillary acidic protein
(GFAP), 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), α-syn, and serine 129
phosphorylated α-syn (p-α-syn). Immunoreactivity of each staining in the
myenteric plexus was quantified using NIH ImageJ software. Results: Marmosets
with colitis had significantly increased expression of inflammatory markers
(HLA-DR, p<0.02; CD3, p<0.008), oxidative stress (8-OHdG, p<0.05), and p-α-syn
(p<0.02) and decreased expression of α-syn (p<0.04) in the colonic myenteric
ganglia compared to normal, healthy controls. Conclusion: Colonic inflammation is
associated with changes in α-syn expression and phosphorylation in the myenteric 
plexus of common marmosets. Future evaluation of the vagus nerve and brain of
animals with colitis will be key to assess the contribution of colitis-induced
ENS α-syn pathology to PD-like pathology in the brain.

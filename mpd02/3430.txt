The phylogenetic relationships of callitrichine primates have been determined by 
DNA sequence analyses of exons 1, 2, and 3 of the beta2-microglobulin gene.
Parsimony, distance, and maximum likelihood analyses of ca. 900 base pairs of 21 
taxa, representing all callitrichine genera, indicated that Saguinus was the most
basal offshoot. Within Saguinus, S. fuscicollis appeared as the first divergent
lineage followed by an unresolved trichotomy formed by S. mystax/S. imperator, S.
midas/S. bicolor, and S. oedipus. A second callitrichine lineage was formed by
Leontopithecus; each of the three species studied showed identical nucleotide
sequences. Callimico appeared as the sister taxon of Callithrix/Cebuella. Genetic
distances within this latter group were very small, although a stronger
association between Cebuella and species of the Callithrix argentata group was
observed. The inclusion of Cebuella in the genus Callithrix is suggested. These
studies indicated that tamarins are more plesiomorphic than marmosets in
agreement with the phyletic dwarfism hypothesis.

The possibility was examined that the membrane function of erythrocytes obtained 
from healthy common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) was modified by the presence
in the cells of Heinz bodies. No significant differences were found in
erythrocyte endogenous free malonyl dialdehyde (MDA) or reduced glutathione (GSH)
between normal human erythrocytes and marmoset erythrocytes containing Heinz
bodies. Membrane fluorescent chromolipids, surface charge and thiol levels were
similar in both species but average membrane bulk lipid fluidity was slightly
elevated in the marmosets. It was concluded that, in contrast to the situation in
human erythrocytes, the presence of Heinz bodies in red cells of marmosets does
not adversely affect the properties of the membrane.

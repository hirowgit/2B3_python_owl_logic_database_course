Development of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID) remains a major problem in the
long-term treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). Sensitization to L-DOPA
correlates with ectopic expression of D3 dopamine receptors in the striatum,
implicating D3 receptors in development of LID. We demonstrate that the selective
D3 antagonist S33084 abolishes development of LID over 30 days in MPTP-lesioned
marmosets without effecting the anti-parkinsonian actions of L-DOPA. Furthermore,
following a 14 day washout, when challenged with L-DOPA in the absence of S33084,
these animals continued to exhibit reduced LID. In the 6-OHDA-lesioned rat,
S33084 similarly attenuated development of behavioural sensitization to L-DOPA.
Additionally, L-DOPA-induced elevations in striatal pre-proenkephalin-A (PPE-A)
(but not PPE-B, phospho[Thr(34)]DARPP-32, D1, and D2 receptor mRNA or D3 receptor
levels) were reduced in S33084 treated animals. Our data suggest a role for D3
receptors in the development of LID and suggest that initiating L-DOPA treatment 
with a D3 antagonist may reduce the development of LID in PD.

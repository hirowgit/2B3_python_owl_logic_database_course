A newly developed telemetry system was used to study deep body temperature (BT)
of two adult male common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus). The BT-curves of both
monkeys showed a similar clear circadian rhythm with a range up to 3.5 degrees C.
At environmental temperature of 28 degrees C (ET) the BT of the monkeys varied in
the daytime dependent on their spontaneous activity, with little individual
differences between 37.5 degrees C and 39.3 degrees C; at night the BT of the
remarkably deeply-sleeping animals decreased to an average at 35.8 degrees C.
Elevating ET up to 30 degrees C effected an increase of BT by 0.6 degrees C, both
during day and night. On the contrary, reducing ET to 24 degrees C the BT
increased only at night, by 0.2 degrees C at ad libitum food intake and 1.0
degrees C at fasting. Measurements of BT by inserted rectal thermometer caused,
compared with telemetry, an average at 0.4 degrees C higher values.

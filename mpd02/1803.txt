BACKGROUND: Common marmosets are widely used as experimental primates; however,
little is still known about their bone physiology. Therefore, the aim of our
study was to analyse body weight, age and bone-specific blood parameters in
relation to morphological bone parameters.
METHODS: Fifty-eight common marmosets were analysed for blood calcium (Ca),
inorganic phosphor (P(i) ), alkaline phosphatase (AP) and 17-β-estradiol (E2).
The examination of bone parameters was undertaken in the lumbar spine by computer
tomography.
RESULTS: There was a correlation between bone mineral density (BMD) and body
weight, trabecular area ratio and polar moment as well as between BMD and AP or
Ca (only males), whereas there were no correlations between BMD and age, P(i) or 
E2 in all analysed genders.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data support the assumption that the common marmoset is a
reliable primate model to study changes in bone metabolism because of the
similarity of our results to humans.

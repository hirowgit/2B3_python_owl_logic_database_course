The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is increasingly being used as a
non-human primate animal model in biomedical research. To perform accurate
quantitative analysis of gene expression by quantitative reverse transcription
polymerase chain reaction, reliable reference genes should be selected. In this
study, we evaluated the expressions of 11 widely used reference genes: ACTB,
ATP5F1, B2M, GAPDH, HPRT1, PGK1, PPIA, RN18S1, RPLP0, TBP and UBC in 12 tissues
and five brain areas of healthy common marmosets. NormFinder and geNorm indicated
that the most suitable reference genes for cross-sectional studies of the 17
tissues were RN18S1 and RPLP0. Conversely, ACTB and PPIA were the most suitable
for analyzing brain samples; however, the expression of PGK1 fluctuated among
brain areas. These results indicate that suitable reference genes differ between 
the tissues examined. This study provides fundamental information for gene
expression studies of the common marmoset and highlights the importance of
validating reference genes before quantification of target mRNAs.

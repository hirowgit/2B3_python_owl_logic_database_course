cortex.

The notion that neurons with higher selectivity carry more information about
external sensory inputs is widely accepted in neuroscience. High-selectivity
neurons respond to a narrow range of sensory inputs, and thus would be considered
highly informative by rejecting a large proportion of possible inputs. In
auditory cortex, neuronal responses are less selective immediately after the
onset of a sound and then become highly selective in the following sustained
response epoch. These 2 temporal response epochs have thus been interpreted to
encode first the presence and then the content of a sound input. Contrary to
predictions from that prevailing theory, however, we found that the neural
population conveys similar information about sound input across the 2 epochs in
spite of the neuronal selectivity differences. The amount of information encoded 
turns out to be almost completely dependent upon the total number of population
spikes in the read-out window for this system. Moreover, inhomogeneous Poisson
spiking behavior is sufficient to account for this property. These results imply 
a novel principle of sensory encoding that is potentially shared widely among
multiple sensory systems.

Effective antiviral treatments for MERS-CoV are urgently needed. LCA60 is a
MERS-CoV-neutralizing monoclonal antibody isolated from a convalescent MERS
patient. Previously, it was shown that treatment with LCA60 resulted in reduced
disease and virus titers in mouse models of MERS-CoV infection. Here, we tested
the prophylactic efficacy of LCA60 in the common marmoset model of MERS-CoV
infection. Intravenous administration of LCA60 one day before virus challenge
resulted in high levels of MERS-CoV-neutralizing activity in circulating blood.
Clinically, there was a moderate benefit of treatment with LCA60 including
reduced respiratory involvement. Although viral lung loads were not reduced in
LCA60-treated animals as compared to controls, there were fewer pathological
changes in the lungs. Thus, prophylactic LCA60 treatment could be implemented to 
reduce disease burden in contacts of confirmed MERS-CoV patients.

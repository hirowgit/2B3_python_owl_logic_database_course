Design and synthesis of novel tricyclic benzoxazines as potent 5-HT(1A/B/D)
receptor antagonists leading to the discovery of
6-{2-[4-(2-methyl-5-quinolinyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl}-4H-imidazo[5,1-c][1,4]benzox
azine-3-carboxamide (GSK588045).

Bioisoteric replacement of the metabolically labile N-methyl amide group of a
series of benzoxazinones with small heterocyclic rings has led to novel series of
fused tricyclic benzoxazines which are potent 5-HT(1A/B/D) receptor antagonists
with and without concomitant human serotonin transporter (hSerT) activity.
Optimizing against multiple parameters in parallel identified
6-{2-[4-(2-methyl-5-quinolinyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl}-4H-imidazo[5,1-c][1,4]benzox
azine-3-carboxamide (GSK588045) as a potent 5-HT(1A/B/D) receptor antagonist with
a high degree of selectivity over human ether-a-go-go related gene (hERG)
potassium channels, favorable pharmacokinetics, and excellent activity in vivo in
rodent pharmacodynamic (PD) models. On the basis of its outstanding overall
profile, this compound was progressed as a clinical candidate with the ultimate
aim to assess its potential as a faster acting antidepressant/anxiolytic with
reduced side-effect burden.

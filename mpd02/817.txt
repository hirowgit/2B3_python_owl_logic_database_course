Fused in sarcoma (FUS) is an RNA binding protein that is involved in
frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).
To establish the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) as a model for FTLD, we
generated a stereotaxic injection-based marmoset model of FUS-silencing. We
designed shRNAs against the marmoset FUS gene and generated an AAV9 virus
encoding the most effective shRNA against FUS (shFUS). The AAV encoding shFUS
(AAV-shFUS) was introduced into the frontal cortex of young adult marmosets,
whereas AAV encoding a control shRNA was injected into the contralateral side. We
obtained approximately 70-80% silencing of FUS following AAV-shFUS injection.
Interestingly, FUS-silencing provoked a proliferation of astrocytes and
microglias. Since FTLD is characterized by various emotional deficits, it would
be helpful to establish a marmoset model of FUS-silencing in various brain
tissues for investigating the pathomechanism of higher cognitive and behavioral
dysfunction.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is thought to be initiated by the interaction of genetic 
and environmental factors, eliciting an autoimmune attack on the central nervous 
system. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is the strongest infectious risk factor, but an 
explanation for the paradox between high infection prevalence and low MS
incidence remains elusive. We discuss new data using marmosets with experimental 
autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) - a valid primate model of MS. The findings
may help to explain how a common infection can contribute to the pathogenesis of 
MS. We propose that EBV infection induces citrullination of peptides in
conjunction with autophagy during antigen processing, endowing B cells with the
capacity to cross-present autoantigen to CD8+CD56+ T cells, thereby leading to MS
progression.

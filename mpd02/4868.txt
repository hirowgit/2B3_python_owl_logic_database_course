Chromosome banding patterns and nucleolar organizing regions in three species of 
Callithricidae (Saguinus oedipus, Saguinus fuscicollis, and Callithrix jacchus).

Bedard MT, Ma NS, Jones TC.

Chromosome complements of three species of Callithricidae, Saguinus oedipus,
Saguinus fuscicollis and Callithrix jacchus, were analyzed by various banding
techniques. Morphometric data are presented. A diploid chromosome number of 2n = 
46 is reconfirmed for all three species. Several interesting interspecies
chromosomal variations were demonstrated by G- and C-band patterns. Active
nucleolar organizing regions (NORs) were revealed by the Ag-AS silver
histochemical stain.

This paper describes the use of a new 3D high-resolution imaging technique
dedicated to functional vessels for a systematic quantitative study of
angiogenesis in the primate cortex. We present a new method which permits, using 
synchrotron X-ray micro-tomography imaging, the identification of micro-vascular 
components as well as their automatic numerical digitalization and extraction
from very large 3D image analysis and post-treatments. This method is used to
analyze various levels of micro-vascular organization and their postnatal
modifications. Comparing newborn- and adult marmosets, we found an increase in
vascular volume (270%), exchange surface (260%) and vessel length (290%)
associated to a decrease in distances between vessel and tissue (32%). The
increase in relative vascular volumes between the two ages, examined through the 
whole cortical depth, has been found to be mainly sustained by events occurring
at the capillary level, and only marginally at the perforating vessel level. This
work shows that the postnatal cortical maturation classically described in terms 
of synaptogenesis, gliogenesis and connectivity plasticity is accompanied by an
intensive remodeling of micro-vascular patterns.

Cerebral blood flow (CBF) is the most common parameter for the quantification of 
brain's function. Literature data indicate a widespread dispersion of values that
might be related to some differences in the measurement conditions that are not
properly taken into account in CBF evaluation. Using recent high-resolution
imaging of the complete cortical microvasculature of primate brain, we perform
extensive numerical evaluation of the cerebral perfusion. We show that blood
perfusion associated with intravascular tracers should be normalized by the
surface of the voxel rather than by its volume and we consistently test this
result on the available literature data.

Indoor-outdoor housing systems for a self-sustaining marmoset breeding colony.

Stein FJ, Sis RR, Levy BM.

Indoor-outdoor housing of three types was designed, constructed, used and
evaluated for housing a breeding colony of common (Callithrix jacchus) and
cottontop (Saguinus oedipus) marmosets. All types were relatively inexpensive to 
construct, required minimal care, simulated a natural environment and allowed for
some isolation between units and between individual runs within units.

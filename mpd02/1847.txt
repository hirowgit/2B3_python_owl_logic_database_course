We investigated sex determination via the ZFX and ZFY genes using PCR-RFLP in the
common marmoset. We designed a novel primer set to detect ZFX and ZFY. A 483-bp
band from the ZFX gene and a 471-bp band from the ZFY gene were amplified.
Sequencing data of the products amplified from ZFX and ZFY showed the recognition
sites of two restriction enzymes, DdeI and MseI, respectively. After digestion of
the products using each enzyme, we found that the band patterns between females
and males were different. PCR-based sex identification might provide a tool for
further breeding studies and experimental embryological studies using marmosets.

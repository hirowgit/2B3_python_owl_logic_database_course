Recent advances in genome editing have facilitated the generation of nonhuman
primate (NHP) models, with potential to unmask the complex biology of human
disease not revealed by rodent models. However, their broader use is hindered by 
the challenges associated with generation of adult NHP models as well as the cost
of their production. Here, we describe the generation of a marmoset model of
severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). This study optimized zinc-finger
nucleases (ZFNs) and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) to 
target interleukin-2 receptor subunit gamma (IL2RG) in pronuclear stage marmoset 
embryos. Nine of 21 neonates exhibited mutations in the IL2RG gene, concomitant
with immunodeficiency, and three neonates have currently survived from 240 days
to 1.8 years. Our approach demonstrates highly efficient production of founder
NHP with SCID phenotypes, with promises of multiple pre-clinical and
translational applications.

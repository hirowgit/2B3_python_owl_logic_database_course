Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), which is caused by a newly discovered
coronavirus (CoV), has recently emerged. It causes severe viral pneumonia and is 
associated with a high fatality rate. However, the pathogenesis, comparative
pathology and inflammatory cell response of rhesus macaques and common marmosets 
experimentally infected with MERS-CoV are unknown. We describe the
histopathological, immunohistochemical, and ultrastructural findings from rhesus 
macaque and common marmoset animal models of MERS-CoV infection. The main
histopathological findings in the lungs of rhesus macaques and common marmosets
were varying degrees of pulmonary lesions, including pneumonia, pulmonary oedema,
haemorrhage, degeneration and necrosis of the pneumocytes and bronchial
epithelial cells, and inflammatory cell infiltration. The characteristic
inflammatory cells in the lungs of rhesus macaques and common marmosets were
eosinophils and neutrophils, respectively. Based on these observations, the lungs
of rhesus macaques and common marmosets appeared to develop chronic and acute
pneumonia, respectively. MERS-CoV antigens and viral RNA were identified in type 
I and II pneumocytes, alveolar macrophages and bronchial epithelial cells, and
ultrastructural observations showed that viral protein was found in type II
pneumocytes and inflammatory cells in both species. Correspondingly, the entry
receptor DDP4 was found in type I and II pneumocytes, bronchial epithelial cells,
and alveolar macrophages. The rhesus macaque and common marmoset animal models of
MERS-CoV can be used as a tool to mimic the oncome of MERS-CoV infections in
humans. These models can help to provide a better understanding of the pathogenic
process of this virus and to develop effective medications and prophylactic
treatments.

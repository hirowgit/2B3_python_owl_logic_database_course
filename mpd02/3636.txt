A series of renin inhibitors containing the
(2S,3S,5S)-2-amino-1-cyclohexyl-6-methyl-3,5-heptanediol (2-amino-3,5-anti-diol) 
fragment as a novel transition-state mimic was synthesized, and their biological 
activities were evaluated. All of the synthesized compounds containing the
2-amino-3,5-anti-diol fragment at the P1-P1' position showed high in vitro
renin-inhibitory activity with IC50 values in the 10(-8)-10(-10) M range, and
most of them caused a reduction of blood pressure when administered orally to
salt-depleted, conscious marmosets. The inhibitor (29) with the
4-hydroxypiperidine residue at the P4 position showed the highest activity in
terms of both potency and duration of the blood pressure-lowering effect.

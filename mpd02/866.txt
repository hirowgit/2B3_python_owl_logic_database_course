BACKGROUND: The common marmoset has been used as an experimental animal for
various purposes. Because its average weight ranges from 250 to 500Â g, weight
loss quickly becomes critical for sick animals. Therefore, effective and
non-stressful treatment for chronic diseases, including diarrhoea, is essential.
CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case in which faecal microbiota transplantation
(FMT) led to immediate recovery from chronic and recurrent diarrhoea caused by
Clostridium difficile infection. A male common marmoset experienced chronic
diarrhoea after antibiotic treatments. The animal experienced severe weight loss,
and a faecal sample was confirmed to be C. difficile-positive but was negative
for protozoa. Metronidazole was partially effective at the first administration
but not after the recurrence of the clinical signs. Then, oral FMT was
administered to the subject by feeding fresh faeces from healthy individuals
mixed with the marmoset's usual food. We monitored the faeces by categorization
into four groups: normal, loose, diarrhoea, and watery. After the first day of
FMT treatment, the marmoset underwent a remarkable recovery from diarrhoea, and
after the fourth day of treatment, a test for C. difficile was negative. The
clinical signs did not recur. The marmoset recovered from sinusitis and bilateral
dacryocystitis, which also did not recur, as a by-product of the improvement in
its general health caused by the cessation of diarrhoea after the FMT.
CONCLUSION: This is the first reported case of successful treatment of a marmoset
using oral FMT. As seen in human patients, FMT was effective for the treatment of
recurrent C. difficile infection in a captive marmoset.

The use of common marmosets as an alternative non-human primate model for
infectious disease research using BSL-3 viruses such as Rift Valley fever virus
(RVFV) presents unique challenges with respect to housing, handling, and safety. 
Subject matter experts from veterinary care, animal husbandry, biosafety,
engineering, and research were consulted to design a pilot experiment using
marmosets infected with RVFV. This paper reviews the caging, handling, and
safety-related adaptations and modifications that were required to humanely
utilize marmosets as a model for high-hazard BSL-3 viral diseases.

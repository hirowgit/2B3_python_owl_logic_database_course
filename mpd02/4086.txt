A series of C-3' ortho dihydroxyphthalimido cephalosporins 3-7 has been prepared 
by reaction of C-3' aminomethyl cephalosporin 41 with the corresponding
N-carboethoxyphthalimides 23-25, 37, 38. These new cephalosporins exhibit
excellent in vitro Gram-negative activities, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa,
excellent beta-lactamases stability and pharmacokinetics equivalent or better
than ceftriaxone.

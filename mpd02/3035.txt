CD40-CD40 ligand interactions are crucial to cognate interactions between T
cells, B cells and antigen-presenting cells (APC), and contribute to
non-antigen-specific effector functions of APC in inflammatory disorders. Here we
demonstrate that functional blockade of CD40 with an antagonist mouse anti-human 
CD40 monoclonal antibody (mAb mu5D12) effectively prevents clinical expression of
chronic demyelinating experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in outbred 
marmoset monkeys, a preclinical model of multiple sclerosis. Anti-CD40 mAb
interfered with development of clinical symptoms of marmoset EAE during the
treatment period, even when treatment was started several weeks after T cell
priming. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated inflammatory activity in the
brain at initiation of antibody treatment, confirming that treatment interfered
with the disease process. Access of therapeutic anti-CD40 to potential sites of
action, the secondary lymphoid organs and the brain white matter lesions, was
visualized in situ. The present data are the first to demonstrate the clinical
potential of blocking APC and effector cell functions using murine antagonist
anti-CD40 mAb in the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases.

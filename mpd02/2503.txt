Like human fathers, male marmosets help raise their young, yet the ways in which 
fatherhood influences the brain remain largely unknown. We show that first-time
and experienced marmoset fathers have enhanced density of dendritic spines on
pyramidal neurons in prefrontal cortex as compared to non-fathers. In parallel,
the abundance of vasopressin V1a receptors and the proportion of V1a
receptor-labeled dendritic spines increase.

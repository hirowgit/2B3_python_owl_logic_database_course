The objectives of this study were (a) to establish a population pharmacokinetic
model and (b) to investigate the clinical and physiological effects of a single
bolus dose of propofol in common marmosets. In Study 1, pharmacokinetic analysis 
was performed in six marmosets under sevoflurane anaesthesia. 8 mg/kg of propofol
was administrated at a rate of 4 mg kg-1  min-1 . Blood samples were collected 2,
5, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120 or 180 min after starting propofol administration. Plasma 
concentration was measured, and population pharmacokinetic modelling was
performed. A two-compartment model was selected as the final model. The
population pharmacokinetic parameters were as follows: V1  = 1.14 L, V2  = 77.6
L, CL1  = 0.00182 L/min, CL2  = 0.0461 L/min. In Study 2, clinical and
physiological parameters were assessed and recorded every 2 min after 12 mg/kg of
propofol was administrated at a rate of 4 mg kg-1  min-1 . Immobilization was
sustained for 5 min following propofol administration without apparent
bradycardia. While combination of propofol and sevoflurane caused apnoea in Study
1, apnoea was not observed following single administration of propofol in Study
2. These data provide bases for further investigation on intravenous anaesthesia 
using propofol in common marmosets.

In order to evaluate the immune response produced by rabies vaccines in new world
nonhuman primates, thirty marmosets (Callithrix sp) were divided into five groups
of six individuals and submitted to five different antirabies vaccination schemes
using two distinct commercially available animal vaccines. The first was produced
in suckling mouse brain (Fuenzalida and Palacios), and the second in NIL-2 cell
culture. Post-vaccine serological monitoring was carried out periodically. The
results showed that the Fuenzalida and Palacios vaccine was not able to protect
the animals when using a single dose or even with a booster. But when submitted
to a vaccination routine similar to that used for humans, the marmosets showed
detectable antibodies, and only one succumbed to rabies after being challenged.
In addition, the vaccine produced in NIL-2 cell culture induced high antibody
levels in all vaccinated animals and all animals survived the viral challenge.

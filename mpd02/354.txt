Even after birth, neuronal production continues in the ventricular-subventricular
zone (V-SVZ) and hippocampus in many mammals. The immature new neurons
("neuroblasts") migrate and then mature at their final destination. In humans,
neuroblast production and migration toward the neocortex and the olfactory bulb
(OB) occur actively only for a few months after birth and then sharply decline
with age. However, the precise spatiotemporal profiles and fates of postnatally
born neurons remain unclear due to methodological limitations. We previously
found that common marmosets, small nonhuman primates, share many features of
V-SVZ organization with humans. Here, using marmosets injected with thymidine
analogue(s) during various postnatal periods, we demonstrated spatiotemporal
changes in neurogenesis during development. V-SVZ progenitor proliferation and
neuroblast migration toward the OB and neocortex sharply decreased by 4 months,
most strikingly in a V-SVZ subregion from which neuroblasts migrated toward the
neocortex. Postnatally born neurons matured within a few months in the OB and
hippocampus but remained immature until 6 months in the neocortex. While
neurogenic activity was sustained for a month after birth, the distribution
and/or differentiation diversity was more restricted in 1-month-born cells than
in the neonatal-born population. These findings shed light on distinctive
features of postnatal neurogenesis in primates.

Immunization of marmosets with Trypanosoma cruzi cell surface glycoprotein
(GP90).

Scott MT, Neal RA, Woods NC.

Marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) have been immunized with a vaccine comprising a
Trypanosoma cruzi 90K cell surface glycoprotein and the adjuvant saponin; a
combination previously shown to be protective in mice. Immunization was by two
s.c. injections one month apart and non-lethal challenge of homologous Y strain
T. cruzi was given one month after the booster immunization. No anti-T. cruzi
antibodies were detected after the first immunization but high levels developed
after boosting. Immunization caused a significant decrease in the levels of acute
phase blood parasitaemia, however, both immunized and control animals remained
xenodiagnosis positive 60 weeks after infection. No ECG aberrations,
histopathological lesions or anti-tissue antibodies were detected in infected
marmosets.

In previous studies, we found multiple copies of inducible nitric oxide synthase 
gene (NOS2)-like sequences in the human genome and mapped them to the pericentric
region of chromosome 17. Here, we describe the cloning and sequencing of exon22
regions from three of these NOS2-like sequences. We have also mapped another
NOS2-like sequence to human chromosome 14. Since there are multiple NOS2-like
sequences present in the human genome, we have also carried out Zoo Blot
hybridisation analysis using a NOS2 cDNA probe. Our data suggest that duplication
of NOS2-like sequences occurred very recently in primate evolution.

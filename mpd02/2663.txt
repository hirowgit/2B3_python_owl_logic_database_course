The pro-toxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) is widely used 
to create animal models of Parkinson's disease. This unit describes protocols for
the production of stable and substantial lesions in the dopaminergic
nigrostriatal pathway of mice and non-human primates. The models can be employed 
for assessing the neural mechanisms underlying the development of Parkinson's
disease and for screening potential therapies for the treatment of this
condition.

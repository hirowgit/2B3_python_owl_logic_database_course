Cells of the subependymal layer (SEL) have been shown to be capable of continued 
postnatal cell division throughout life in rodents. To determine if the primate
brain behaves similarly, proliferative activity in the SEL of the marmoset has
been investigated by tritiated thymidine autoradiography and bromodeoxyuridine
immunocytochemistry. Both methods revealed the presence of DNA-synthesizing cells
at all postnatal ages studied. The labelling index (LI), low at birth, reached a 
peak of almost 4% at one month but decreased gradually thereafter. In animals
older than two years the LI was extremely low and labelled cells were rarely seen
anywhere in the brain. The cell density of the SEL, in contrast to the low LI,
was highest in neonates and decreased linearly with increasing age.
Bromodeoxyuridine immunoreactivity revealed the distribution of proliferating
cells in the SEL and neighbouring regions. Such cells were most abundant around
the anterior lateral ventricle where the SEL was most evident. Proliferating
cells were numerous in neonates, though not adjacent to the ependyma where counts
for the LI were made, and were mainly located dorsally and ventrally at the
junctions of the corpus callosum and caudate nucleus.

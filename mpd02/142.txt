In mammals, dosage compensation of X-linked gene expression between males and
females is achieved by inactivation of a single X chromosome in females, while
upregulation of the single active X in males and females leads to X:autosome
dosage balance. Studies in human embryos revealed that random X chromosome
inactivation starts at the preimplantation stage and is not complete by day 12 of
development. Alternatively, others proposed that dosage compensation in human
preimplantation embryos is achieved by dampening expression from the two X
chromosomes in females. Here, we characterize X-linked dosage compensation in
another primate, the marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). Analyzing scRNA-seq data from
preimplantation embryos, we detected upregulation of XIST at the morula stage,
where female embryos presented a significantly higher expression of XIST than
males. Moreover, we show an increase of X-linked monoallelically expressed genes 
in female embryos between the morula and late blastocyst stages, indicative of
XCI. Nevertheless, dosage compensation was not achieved by the late blastocyst
stage. Finally, we show that X:autosome dosage compensation is achieved at the
8-cell stage, and demonstrate that X chromosome dampening in females does not
take place in the marmoset. Our work contributes to the elucidation of primate
X-linked dosage compensation.

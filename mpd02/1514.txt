Due to its short lifespan, ease of use and age-related pathologies that mirror
those observed in humans, the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is poised to
become a standard nonhuman primate model of aging. Blood and extracellular fluid 
possess two major thiol-dependent redox nodes involving cysteine (Cys), cystine
(CySS), glutathione (GSH) and glutathione disulfide (GSSG). Alteration in these
plasma redox nodes significantly affects cellular physiology, and oxidation of
the plasma Cys/CySS redox potential (E hCySS) is associated with aging and
disease risk in humans. The purpose of this study was to determine age-related
changes in plasma redox metabolites and corresponding redox potentials (E h) to
further validate the marmoset as a nonhuman primate model of aging. We measured
plasma thiol redox states in marmosets and used existing human data with
multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) to model the relationships
between age and redox metabolites. A classification accuracy of 70.2% and an AUC 
of 0.703 were achieved using the MARS model built from the marmoset redox data to
classify the human samples as young or old. These results show that common
marmosets provide a useful model for thiol redox biology of aging.

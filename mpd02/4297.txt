Umespirone was compared to buspirone, diazepam and clozapine as a potential
anxiolytic and antipsychotic agent. In the mouse black and white test box,
umespirone was considerably more potent than diazepam or buspirone to reduce
aversive responding, tolerance to its effects was not observed and sedation was
absent, a chronic treatment and withdrawal was not associated with an anxiogenic 
profile, and umespirone prevented the behavioural consequences of withdrawal from
diazepam. Umespirone also had an anxiolytic profile of action in the tests of rat
social interaction and in the marmoset exposed to a human threat. Both umespirone
and clozapine reduced the hyperactivity induced by the infusion of dopamine into 
the nucleus accumbens of rat. In radioligand binding assays umespirone
demonstrated nanomolar affinity for the alpha 1-adrenoceptor and the 5-HT1A and
dopamine D2 receptors. It is concluded that umespirone may present as a novel
psychotropic agent with anxiolytic and antipsychotic potential.

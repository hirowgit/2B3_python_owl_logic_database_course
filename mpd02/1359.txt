Here we investigated the transduction characteristics of adeno-associated viral
vector (AAV) serotypes 1, 2, 5, 8 and 9 in the marmoset cerebral cortex. Using
three constructs that each has hrGFP under ubiquitous (CMV), or neuron-specific
(CaMKII and Synapsin I (SynI)) promoters, we investigated (1) the extent of viral
spread, (2) cell type tropism, and (3) neuronal transduction efficiency of each
serotype. AAV2 was clearly distinct from other serotypes in small spreading and
neuronal tropism. We did not observe significant differences in viral spread
among other serotypes. Regarding the cell tropism, AAV1, 5, 8 and 9 exhibited
mostly glial expression for CMV construct. However, when the CaMKII construct was
tested, cortical neurons were efficiently transduced (>∼70% in layer 3) by all
serotypes, suggesting that glial expression obscured neuronal expression for CMV 
construct. For both SynI and CaMKII constructs, we observed generally high-level 
expression in large pyramidal cells especially in layer 5, as well as in
parvalbumin-positive interneurons. The expression from the CaMKII construct was
more uniformly observed in excitatory cells compared with SynI construct.
Injection of the same viral preparations in mouse and macaque cortex resulted in 
essentially the same result with some species-specific differences.

We measured the temporal modulation transfer functions (TMTFs) of cells in the
marmoset lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) at three different luminance levels,
and described the responses with a linear model. It was found that qualitatively 
there are many similarities with the temporal response properties of macaque and 
marmoset retinal ganglion cells. M-cells displayed stronger attenuation at lower 
temporal frequencies, and showed more nonlinearities (such as saturation and a
contrast gain control) than P-cells. We therefore propose that the temporal
properties of the visual system of New and Old World monkeys are similar at least
up to the LGN. However, there are some quantitative differences, indicating that 
response alterations take place at the stage of synaptic transmission in the LGN.
The most important are an attenuation of the responses to higher temporal
frequencies and the smaller differences between parvo- and magnocellular cell
responsivities. Cell responses to square-wave modulation were also measured and
compared with predictions from a linear systems analysis. The linear systems
analysis gave reasonable predicted responses to square-wave modulation, but these
predictions were poor than those for retinal ganglion cells, indicating that
additional nonlinearities are introduced at the synaptic transition in the LGN.

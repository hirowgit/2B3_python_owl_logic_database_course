Marmosets, Callithrix jacchus, observed a demonstrator removing the lids from a
series of plastic canisters to obtain a mealworm. When subsequently allowed
access to the canisters, marmosets that observed a demonstrator using its hands
to remove the lids used only their hands. In contrast, marmosets that observed a 
demonstrator using its mouth also used their mouth to remove the lids. Since hand
and mouth demonstrators brought about identical changes in the canisters, the
differential test behaviour of the observer groups suggests that they learned
about the demonstrator's behaviour. Furthermore, marmosets that had not been
given the opportunity to observe a demonstrator prior to testing had a low
probability of mouth opening, even if the canisters were previously opened by a
mouth-opening demonstrator in an olfactory control experiment. Corroborating
Bugnyar & Huber's (1997, Animal Behaviour, 54, 817-831) earlier findings, our
results provide further evidence that marmosets can imitate. Copyright 2000 The

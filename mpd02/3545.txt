A humanized antibody to the human interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R), hPM-1, blocked 
the interleukin-6 (IL-6) functions in normal cynomolgus monkey lymphocytes in
vitro. The binding activity of hPM-1 to non-human primate IL-6R was examined in
peripheral blood lymphocytes by flow cytometry. PM-1 recognized the IL-6R on T
lymphocytes of cynomolgus and rhesus monkeys, but did not on those of marmosets. 
The homology between human IL-6R and its cynomolgus monkey counterpart was 97.3% 
in the extracellular domain of the amino acid sequence, as determined by DNA
sequencing of the PCR product from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. PM-1
inhibited two functional parameters in vitro in cynomolgus monkeys: (1), T-cell
proliferation stimulated by phytohemaglutinin and human IL-6; (2), Immunoglobulin
G-production evoked by Staphylococcus aureus Cowan-1- and human IL-6-stimulated B
lymphocytes. These data show that hPM-1 binds to and functionally blocks the
cynomolgus monkey IL-6 receptors.

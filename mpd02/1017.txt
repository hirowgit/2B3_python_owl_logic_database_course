1. A cDNA encoding novel cytochrome P450 (P450) 4A enzyme was cloned from
marmoset livers by reverse transcription (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
based on the marmoset genome sequences. The amino acid sequence deduced from P450
4A11 cDNA contained consensus sequences of six substrate recognition sites and
one heme-binding domain. 2. Marmoset P450 4A11, highly identical (85-88%) to
cynomolgus monkey and human P450 4A enzymes, was grouped into the same cluster as
cynomolgus monkey and human P450 4A enzymes by phylogenetic analysis. 3. The
tissue distribution analyses by real-time RT PCR and immunoblotting demonstrated 
that marmoset P450 4A11 mRNA and proteins were expressed in kidneys and livers.
Marmoset P450 4A11 enzyme heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli
preferentially catalyzed the ω-hydroxylation of arachidonic acid and lauric acid,
similar to cynomolgus monkey and human P450 4A11 enzymes. However, lauric acid
ω-hydroxylation activity of marmoset P450 4A11 was low compared with those of
marmoset liver microsomes. 4. These results indicated that novel marmoset P450
4A11 was also a fatty acid ω-hydroxylase expressed in kidneys and livers, with
the same regioselectivity (at ω-position of fatty acid) as cynomolgus monkey and 
human P450 4A enzymes.

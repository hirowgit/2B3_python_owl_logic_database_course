Comparative autoradiographic and metabolic study of delta8- and
delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol in the brain of the marmoset Callithrix jacchus.

The label distribution in the brain of the marmoset Callithrix jacchus following 
intravenous application of radioactively labeled delta8-tetrahydrocannabinol
(delta8-THC) and delta9-THC is investigated by autoradiographic technique.
Accumulations of label are observed in nuclei concerned with motor function, in
the optic and acoustic pathways, and a few other structures. Of the two
hydroxylated isomeres which were shown to be equally psychoactive the brain
concentration of 11-OH-delta9-THC was found to be about 3 times higher as
compared with 11-OH-delta8 THC, which may explain why delta9-THC is more potent
than delta8-THC. More than 90% of the radioactivity found in the brain can be
attributed to the THCs and their 11-hydroxylated isomeres. Polar metabolites are 
almost completely absent from the brain.

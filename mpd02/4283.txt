A high-performance liquid chromatographic method with column switching was
developed for the determination of the renin inhibitor Ro 42-5892/001,
(S)-alpha-[(S)-alpha-[(tert.-butylsulphonyl)methyl]hydrocinnama mido]-N-
[(1S,2R,3S)-1-(cyclohexylmethyl)-3-cylcopropyl-2,
3-dihydroxypropyl]imidazole-4-propionamide methanesulphonate (1:1), in rat,
marmoset and human plasma, using a Nucleosil C8 120 (3 microns) stationary phase.
Since the analyte and the internal standard are optical isomers,
beta-cyclodextrin was used as a mobile phase constituent for their chiral
separation. The method took advantage of the characteristics of dabsyl chloride
derivatives, namely sensitivity, specificity and, particularly, stability,
providing a quantification limit of 5 ng/ml. The accuracy (range of inaccuracy
1-13%) and the inter-assay precision (coefficient of variation range 1.8-9.1%)
were acceptable. The method was successfully applied to toxicokinetic studies in 
rats and marmosets.

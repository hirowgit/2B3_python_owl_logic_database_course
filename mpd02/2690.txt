Common marmosets, a Neotropical monkey species, are protected against clinical
and neuropathological consequences of experimentally induced autoimmune
encephalomyelitis (EAE) by prophylactic treatment with ch5D12, a humanized
antagonist antibody against human CD40. In the current study we have tested
whether ch5D12 acts therapeutically against the enlargement and inflammatory
activity of existing (brain) white matter lesions using serial magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI). The results show in all PBS treated monkeys (n=4) a rapid
enlargement of T2 lesions together with an increment of the T2 signal intensity
due to inflammatory edema. Treatment with ch5D12 delayed the enlargement of T2
lesions in 2 out of 3 tested monkeys while in 3 out of 3 monkeys the T2 signal
increment of lesions was suppressed. In conjunction with previously published
data on the clinical benefit of anti-CD40 treatment in the marmoset EAE model,
the current findings support antibody-mediated blockade of CD40 interaction with 
its ligand CD154 as a potential treatment of MS.

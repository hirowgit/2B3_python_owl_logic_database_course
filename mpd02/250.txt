BACKGROUND: From the end of 2016 until the beginning of 2019, Brazil faced a
massive sylvatic yellow fever (YF) outbreak. The 2016-2019 YF epidemics affected 
densely populated areas, especially the Southeast region, causing thousands of
deaths of humans and non-human primates (NHP).
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We conducted a molecular investigation of yellow 
fever virus (YFV) RNA in 781 NHP carcasses collected in the urban, urban-rural
interface, and rural areas of Minas Gerais state, from January 2017 to December
2018. Samples were analyzed according to the period of sampling, NHP genera,
sampling areas, and sampling areas/NHP genera to compare the proportions of
YFV-positive carcasses and the estimated YFV genomic loads. YFV infection was
confirmed in 38.1% of NHP carcasses (including specimens of the genera Alouatta, 
Callicebus, Callithrix, and Sapajus), from the urban, urban-rural interface, and 
rural areas. YFV RNA detection was positively associated with epidemic periods
(especially from December to March) and the rural environment. Higher median
viral genomic loads (one million times) were estimated in carcasses collected in 
rural areas compared to urban ones.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The results showed the wide occurrence of YF in Minas
Gerais in epidemic and non-epidemic periods. According to the sylvatic pattern of
YF, a gradient of viral dissemination from rural towards urban areas was
observed. A high YF positivity was observed for NHP carcasses collected in urban 
areas with a widespread occurrence in 67 municipalities of Minas Gerais,
including large urban centers. Although there was no documented case of
urban/Aedes YFV transmission to humans in Brazil during the 2016-2019 outbreaks, 
YFV-infected NHP in urban areas with high infestation by Aedes aegypti poses
risks for YFV urban/Aedes transmission and urbanization.

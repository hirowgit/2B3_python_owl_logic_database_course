Here we present, for the first time, the complete chromosome painting map of
Saguinus midas, the red-handed tamarin. Chromosome banding and painting with
human chromosome-specific probes were used to compare the karyotype of this
species with those of four other Neotropical primates of the subfamily
Callitrichinae: Leontopithecus rosalia, Callithrix geoffroyi, C. penicillata, and
Mico argentatus. The chromosome painting map of S. midas was identical to that of
L. rosalia and other previously studied tamarin species (genera Saguinus and
Leontopithecus). The three marmoset species studied (genera Callithrix and Mico) 
differed in the painting pattern of four human probes (chromosomes 1, 2, 10, and 
16). These paints identified the presence or absence of chromosome associations
HSA 1/10 and 2/16 in these taxa. By integrating our data with those from the
literature, we were able to propose an ancestral Callitrichinae karyotype. The
genera Saguinus and Leontopithecus (tamarins) conserve the ancestral
Callitrichinae karyotype, while Mico and Callithrix (marmosets) show more derived
karyotypes due to chromosome translocations and fissions that occurred during the
evolution of these taxa.

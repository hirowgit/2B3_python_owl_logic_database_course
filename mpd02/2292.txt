This basic protocol presents Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) transformation of B cells
to create a permanent cell line to provide cells for genetic and DNA analysis.
Virus stocks are prepared from cultures of an infected marmoset cell line in the 
first support protocol. Transformed cells may be analyzed immediately or frozen
for future use as described in the second support protocol.

Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is one of the most potent endogenous
vasodilators known. This peptide is increased during migraine attacks and has
been implicated in the pathogenesis of migraine headache. Here we report on the
first small molecule selective CGRP antagonist: BIBN4096BS. In vitro, this
compound is extremely potent at primate CGRP receptors exhibiting an affinity
(Ki) for human CGRP receptors of 14.4 +/- 6.3 (n = 4) pM. In an in vivo model,
BIBN4096BS in doses between 1 and 30 micrograms kg-1 (i.v.) inhibited the effects
of CGRP, released by stimulation of the trigeminal ganglion, on facial blood flow
in marmoset monkeys. It is concluded that BIBN4096BS is a potent and selective
CGRP antagonist.

The present report documents the breeding success of a new colony of common
marmosets (Callithrix jacchus jacchus) and demonstrates a correlation between
environmental stress and reproductive success. Environmental conditions ranged
chronologically over 40 months, through four periods: I) the initial period, when
the colony was formed; II) a phase of relative environmental stability; III) a
stage of "environmental stress" (when the colony was disrupted by nearby
construction); and IV) a return to a stable environment. Examination of
reproductive status during each period indicated that the colony exhibited severe
reproductive suppression during the time of the environmental disruption. Parity 
and the number of live births decreased and the number of spontaneous abortions
increased during this period. Reproductive success remained low during period IV.
More triplets than twins were born during the period of relative environmental
stability.

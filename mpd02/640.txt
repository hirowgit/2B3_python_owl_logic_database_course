BACKGROUND: Common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) are potentially useful nonhuman
primate models for preclinical studies. Information for major drug-metabolizing
cytochrome P450 (P450) enzymes is now available that supports the use of this
primate species as an animal model for drug development. Here, we collect and
provide an overview of information on the activities of common marmoset hepatic
and intestinal microsomes with respect to 28 typical human P450 probe oxidations.
RESULTS: Marmoset P450 2D6/8-dependent R-metoprolol O-demethylation activities in
hepatic microsomes were significantly correlated with those of midazolam 1'- and 
4-hydroxylations, testosterone 6β-hydroxylation, and progesterone
6β-hydroxylation, which are probe reactions for marmoset P450 3A4/5/90. In
marmosets, the oxidation activities of hepatic microsomes and intestinal
microsomes were roughly comparable for midazolam and terfenadine. Overall,
multiple forms of marmoset P450 enzymes in livers and intestines had generally
similar substrate recognition functionalities to those of human and/or cynomolgus
monkey P450 enzymes.
CONCLUSION: The marmoset could be a model animal for humans with respect to the
first-pass extraction of terfenadine and related substrates. These findings
provide a foundation for understanding individual pharmacokinetic and
toxicological results in nonhuman primates as preclinical models and will help to
further support understanding of the molecular mechanisms of human P450 function.

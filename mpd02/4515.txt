A biologically active gonadotrophin has been purified from the media of long-term
cultures of trophoblast cells of the common marmoset monkey by a combination of
precipitation and chromatography. Marmoset chorionic gonadotrophin (CG) is a
glycoprotein which binds Concanavalin A and wheat germ agglutinin. The protein
purified from culture media exists as several isoelectric species with pI in the 
range pH 3.5-4.5. On gel filtration it eluted with an apparent molecular weight
of 68-72,000 but on PAGE migrated as if it was 58-65,000. A glycoprotein with
similar characteristics has been recovered from plasma samples of pregnant
marmosets. Biological activity of partly purified CG from media, as determined by
a mouse testicular cell bioassay, was 1-3 i.u./mg protein.

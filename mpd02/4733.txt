Morphology of the interorbital region of Saimiri sciureus.

Maier W.

The skull of the platyrrhine primate Saimiri sciureus is distinguished by a large
interorbital fenestra. Juvenile skulls still show a bony interorbital septum with
some small gaps. A morphogenetic study was undertaken to better understand the
structures of the interorbital region, which represents a linkage between the
base of the braincase and the nasal skeleton. Already in early ontogenetic stages
a reduction of the posterior portion of the nasal capsule and of the
cartilaginous interorbital septum are observed, resulting in the formation of a
primary interorbital fenestra. A bony interorbital septum is mainly formed in
perinatal age stages by ossification of the presphenoid and by medial fusion of
the frontals; the primary interorbital fenestra is retained as a small opening.
It only occurs in late juvenile stages when the definitive interorbital fenestra 
develops by by secondary transformation of bone into a membrane of dense
connective tissue; this process is most probably caused by mechanical friction of
the very closely approximated eyes of both sides.

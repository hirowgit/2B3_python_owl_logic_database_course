We have identified conserved autoantigenic cellular proteins that bind to G-rich 
sequence motifs in recombinogenic regions of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA. This
binding activity, called TRBP, recognizes the EBV terminal repeats, a locus
responsible for interconversion of linear and circular EBV DNA. We found that
TRBP also binds to EBV DNA sequences involved in deletion of EBNA2, a gene
product required for immortalization. We show that TRBP binds sequences present
in repetitive cellular DNA, such as variable-number tandem repeats (VNTR) and
immunoglobulin heavy-chain class switch regions. We propose that EBV utilizes
cellular DNA recombination systems to mediate several types of viral genome
alterations. These findings may lead to an understanding of the mechanism of
rearrangements of EBV DNA that are a central feature of the biology of the virus.

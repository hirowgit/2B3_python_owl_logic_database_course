Proper assessment of outcome in clinical trials of neural transplantation
requires both biochemical and imaging indices of graft survival, and behavioural 
and physiological indices of graft function. For transplantation in Huntington's 
disease, a variety of ligands that are selective for striatal degeneration and
graft-derived replacement are available, notably ligands of dopaminergic
receptors on striatal neurons. However, the validity of such ligands is
potentially compromised by adjunctive drug therapies (e.g. neuroleptics) given to
patients in the course of normal clinical care. We review the present state of
experimental and clinical understanding of the selectivity of available ligands
for striatal imaging, their interaction with other drug treatments, and
strategies for refining valid assessment protocols in patients.

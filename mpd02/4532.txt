Effects of adrenalectomy upon proceptivity, receptivity and sexual attractiveness
in ovariectomized marmosets (Callithrix jacchus).

Dixson AF.

The sexual behaviour of seven pairs of marmosets was observed during blocks of 30
minute tests before and after the ovariectomized partners were bilaterally
adrenalectomized. Adrenalectomized females were maintained by intramuscular
injections of deoxycorticosterone pivalate (DC) and hydrocortisone hemisuccinate 
(HC). Twice daily injections of HC were required to maintain the high levels of
plasma cortisol typical of marmosets and some other New World primates.
Adrenalectomy had no significant effects upon proceptivity, receptivity or female
sexual attractiveness. Increasing the replacement dose of DC had no effects upon 
sexual behaviour. Oestradiol treatment caused a marked increase in proceptivity
(tongue-flicking, staring and immobile displays) and in receptive tongue-flicking
behaviour. Males ejaculated more frequently during tests with oestradiol-treated 
partners. These results indicate that during "pair tests" adrenocortical sex
steroids are not essential for maintenance of sexual behaviour in female
marmosets and that activation of proceptivity by oestradiol 17 beta can occur in 
the absence of the adrenal glands.

We describe the necropsy results from three common marmosets presented during an 
outbreak of hemorrhagic diarrhea in a colony of 230 common marmosets (Callithrix 
jacchus). Necropsy revealed consistent hemorrhagic typhlocolitis and variable
ileitis associated with gram-negative bacilli closely adherent to enterocytes.
Electron microscopy revealed bacilli attached intimately to shallow cup-like
projections of enterocyte apical membranes with loss of microvilli (attaching and
effacing). Escherichia coli isolates from affected marmosets were serogroup O26
and were positive for the E. coli attaching and effacing locus and negative for
shiga-like toxin I and II, heat-stable enterotoxins a and b, and heat-labile
enterotoxin by DNA probe hybridization. Results of a Vero cell cytotoxicity assay
confirmed that the E. coli isolates did not produce shiga-like toxin. The
increased availability of diagnostic probes for specific virulence factors such
as attaching and effacing E. coli should lead to a greater understanding of the
frequency of E. coli as a cause of diarrhea in nonhuman primates.

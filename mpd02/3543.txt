Both adenosine A1 and A2 receptor populations are located in the striatum and can
modify locomotor activity, and they may form a therapeutic target for Parkinson's
disease (PD). Administration of the selective adenosine A2A antagonist
(E)-1,3-diethyl-8-(3,4-dimethoxystyryl)-7-methyl-3,7-dihydro-1H-pu rine-2,6-dione
(KW-6002) to MPTP-treated common marmosets increased locomotor activity. In
contrast, administration of the selective A1 receptor antagonist
1,3-dipropyl-8-cyclopentylxantine (DPCPX) had no effect on locomotion.
Administration of the adenosine A2A receptor agonist 2-[p-[2-(2-aminoethylamino) 
carbonylethyl] phenethyl amino]-5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (APEC) dose
dependently suppressed basal locomotor activity. A minimally effective dose of
APEC (0.62 mg/kg, i.p) completely reversed the increase in locomotor activity
produced by administration of KW-6002. The adenosine A2A receptor appears to be
an important target for the treatment of basal ganglia disorders, particularly
PD.

Overactive AMPA receptor-mediated transmission may be involved in the
pathogenesis of levodopa-induced dyskinesia. The mechanism of action of the
anticonvulsant drug topiramate involves attenuation of AMPA receptor-mediated
transmission. In this study, the potential antidyskinetic action of topiramate
was examined in the MPTP-lesioned marmoset model of Parkinson's disease and
levodopa-induced dyskinesia. Topiramate significantly reduced levodopa-induced
dyskinesia, without affecting the antiparkinsonian action of levodopa. Topiramate
represents an exciting potential novel therapeutic approach to levodopa-induced
dyskinesia in patients with Parkinson's disease.

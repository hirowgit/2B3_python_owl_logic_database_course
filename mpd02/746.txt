The in vivo model of pollinosis has been established using rodents, but the model
cannot completely mimic human pollinosis. We used Callithrix jacchus, the common 
marmoset (CM), to establish a pollinosis animal model using intranasal weekly
administration of cedar pollen extract with cholera toxin adjuvant. Some of the
treated CMs exhibited the symptoms of snitching, excess nasal mucus and/or
sneezing, but the period was very short, and the symptoms disappeared after
several weeks. The CD4+CD25+ cell ratio in the peripheral blood increased in CMs 
quickly after the nasal administration of cedar pollen extract, but the timing
was not parallel with the symptoms. IL-10 mRNA was enhanced in the peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), suggesting CM-induced tolerance for cedar pollen
administration. Similarly, Foxp3 mRNA was also detected in the PBMC. Additive
sensitization of these CMs with Ascaris egg administration did not enhance
chronic inflammation of type 1 allergy to induce the symptoms. These results
suggest that the environmental immune cells develop transient allergic symptoms
and subsequent immune-tolerance in the intranasally sensitized CMs.

Rabies virus (RABV) does not persist in the environment as it is a very fragile
agent. The primary hosts are mammalian species in the orders Carnivora and
Chiroptera. Since the late 1980s, RABV has been isolated from non-human primates,
Callithrix jacchus (the white-tufted marmoset), in four coastal states (Rio
Grande do Norte, Ceará, Piauí and Pernambuco) in north-eastern Brazil, where this
species is indigenous. The original habitat of C. jacchus consisted of two
Brazilian biomes, the Atlantic Forest and the Caatinga. However, these marmosets 
have since adapted to other ecosystems as a result of human activities. Between
1988 and 1989, RABV isolates were obtained from white-tufted marmosets in the
state of Rio Grande do Norte, but antigenic and genetic identification studies
were not conducted at that time. In the following years, three additional states 
reported cases (Ceará, Piauí and Pernambuco). In two of these states (Ceará and
Piauí), human cases of rabies transmitted by marmosets were reported. According
to Brazilian Health Ministry data, at least 19 human cases in which this species 
was the source of infection were registered in between 1990 and 2016. Recent
findings in laboratory tests of 12 rabid samples from humans and marmosets and
the regional transmission among these animals for over 20 years, together with
the gradual increase in the affected geographic area, support the concept of the 
emergence of a new RABV reservoir. Regional tourism, the wild animal trade and
the cultural practice of maintaining these animals as pets, particularly in
coastal regions, appear to be major risk factors for the increase in human cases.
Additional epidemiological and ecological studies are required to better
understand local disease dynamics and to identify ideal opportunities for
prevention and control of this fatal infection.

Rapid diagnosis and management of parainfluenza I virus infection in common
marmosets (Callithrix jacchus).

Sutherland SD, Almeida JD, Gardner PS, Skarpa M, Stanton J.

During 1983 a severe episode of respiratory infection occurred in a marmoset
colony at these laboratories. Of 91 marmosets, 69 showed clinical signs of
disease, one died and nine were so ill that euthanasia was necessary. Eight were 
examined post mortem and all showed consolidation of the lungs. Laboratory
studies were carried out in an attempt to establish the cause of the outbreak and
an interstitial pneumonia was found in seven animals which were examined
histologically. Direct electron microscopy of nasal swabs and lung samples
revealed the presence of a high titre of a paramyxovirus, and subsequent
immunofluorescence studies established that the particular paramyxovirus involved
was parainfluenza virus type I. Subsequent studies showed that surviving affected
animals had seroconverted to parainfluenza I virus while animals that had not
been implicated in the outbreak had not.

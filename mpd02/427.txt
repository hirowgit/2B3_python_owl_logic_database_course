Once believed to be unique features of neoplasia, chimeric RNAs are now being
discovered in normal physiology. We speculated that some chimeric RNAs may be
functional precursors of genes, and that forming chimeric RNA at the
transcriptional level may be a 'trial' mechanism before the functional element is
fixed into the genome. Supporting this idea, we identified a chimeric RNA,
HNRNPA1L2-SUGT1 (H-S), whose sequence is highly similar to that of a 'pseudogene'
MRPS31P5. Sequence analysis revealed that MRPS31P5 transcript is more similar to 
H-S chimeric RNA than its 'parent' gene, MRPS31. Evolutionarily, H-S precedes
MRPS31P5, as it can be detected bioinformatically and experimentally in
marmosets, which do not yet possess MRPS31P5 in their genome. Conversely, H-S is 
minimally expressed in humans, while instead, MRPS31P5 is abundantly expressed.
Silencing H-S in marmoset cells resulted in similar phenotype as silencing
MRPS31P5 in human cells. In addition, whole transcriptome analysis and candidate 
downstream target validation revealed common signalling pathways shared by the
two transcripts. Interestingly, H-S failed to rescue the phenotype caused by
silencing MPRS31P5 in human and rhesus cells, whereas MRPS31P5 can at least
partially rescue the phenotype caused by silencing H-S in marmoset cells,
suggesting that MRPS31P5 may have further evolved into a distinct entity. Thus,
multiple lines of evidence support that MRPS31P5 is not truly a pseudogene of
MRPS31, but a likely functional descendent of H-S chimera. Instead being a gene
fusion product, H-S is a product of cis-splicing between adjacent genes, while
MRPS31P5 is likely produced by genome rearrangement.

The respiratory system maintains homeostatic levels of oxygen (O2) and carbon
dioxide (CO2) in the body through rapid and efficient regulation of breathing
frequency and depth (tidal volume). The commonly used methods of analyzing
breathing data in behaving experimental animals are usually subjective,
laborious, and time-consuming. To overcome these hurdles, we optimized an
analysis toolkit for the unsupervised study of respiratory activities in animal
subjects. Using this tool, we analyzed breathing behaviors of the common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus), a New World non-human primate model. Using whole-body
plethysmography in room air as well as acute hypoxic (10% O2) and hypercapnic (6%
CO2) conditions, we describe breathing behaviors in awake, freely behaving
marmosets. Our data indicate that marmosets' exposure to acute hypoxia decreased 
metabolic rate and increased sigh rate. However, the hypoxic condition did not
augment ventilation. Hypercapnia, on the other hand, increased both the frequency
and depth (i.e., tidal volume) of breathing.

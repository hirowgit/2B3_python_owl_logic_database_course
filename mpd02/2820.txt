Serotonergic dysregulation within the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is implicated in
many neuropsychiatric disorders, but the precise role of serotonin within the PFC
is poorly understood. Using a serial discrimination reversal paradigm, we showed 
that upon reversal, selective serotonin depletion of the marmoset PFC produced
perseverative responding to the previously rewarded stimulus without any
significant effects on either retention of a discrimination learned
preoperatively or acquisition of a novel discrimination postoperatively. These
results highlight the importance of prefrontal serotonin in behavioral
flexibility and are highly relevant to obsessive-compulsive disorder,
schizophrenia, and the cognitive sequelae of drug abuse in which perseveration is
prominent.

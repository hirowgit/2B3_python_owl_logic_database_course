Zacopride, a substituted benzamide derivative, was compared with diazepam in
three models of experimental or provoked anxiety. The drug's action (i) in
reducing aversion to a brightly lit environment was assessed in mice using a two 
compartment black and white test box system, (ii) in disinhibiting a suppressed
behaviour was measured in the rat social interaction test under high
light/unfamiliar conditions and (iii) in antagonizing a defensive response in the
marmoset was assessed using the threat of a human presence. Both zacopride and
diazepam enhanced exploratory behaviour and social interaction in the mouse and
rat models and antagonized the defensive response in the marmoset, zacopride
being 100 times more potent than diazepam. It is concluded that the 5-HT3
receptor antagonist, zacopride, alters rodent and primate behaviour in a manner
consistent with that of an anxiolytic agent.

Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) catalyzes the O-methylation of endogenous
catechol amines and estrogens and exogenous catechol-type of drugs. A Parkinson's
disease model of common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) has been widely used in
preclinical studies to evaluate inhibitory potential of new drug candidates on
marmoset COMT. Despite COMT inhibitors could potentiate the pharmacological
action of levodopa on Parkinson's disease in animal models, marmoset COMT cDNA
has not yet been identified and characterized. In this study, a cDNA highly
homologous to human COMT was cloned from marmoset livers. This cDNA encoded 268
amino acids containing a transmembrane region and critical amino acid residues
for catalytic function. The amino acid sequences of marmoset COMT shared high
sequence identity (90%) with human COMT. COMT mRNA was expressed in all five
tissues tested, including brain, lung, liver, kidney and small intestine, and was
more abundant in marmoset liver and kidney. Membrane-bound COMT was
immunochemically detected in livers and kidneys, whereas soluble COMT was
detected in livers, similar to humans. These results indicated that the molecular
characteristics of marmoset COMT were generally similar to the human ortholog.

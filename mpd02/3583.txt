Molecular cloning of membrane cofactor protein (MCP; CD46) on B95a cell, an
Epstein-Barr virus-transformed marmoset B cell line: B95a-MCP is susceptible to
infection by the CAM, but not the Nagahata strain of the measles virus.

Measles virus (MV) infects not only human beings but also some simian species.
The MV receptor on Vero cells (a cell line established from African Green monkey 
kidney cells) and human cells has been shown to be the membrane cofactor protein 
MCP/CD46, which is an inhibitor of autologous complement (C) activation. B95a, an
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed marmoset B cell line, is a simian cell line 
used for MV selection and is much more susceptible to MV than Vero cells. In the 
present study, we isolated cDNAs encoding MCP homologues from B95a cDNA library
and assessed whether B95a-MCP is responsible for the high susceptibility of B95a 
to MV. The deduced amino acid sequence of the cDNA of B95a-MCP was 76% identical 
to that of human-MCP, and the recombinant B95a-MCP exerts C inhibitor activity.
Although CAM, a vaccine strain of MV, infected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells 
expressing B95a-MCP, Nagahata strain, a wild type of MV, failed to infect the CHO
transfectants, suggesting that additional membrane molecules of B95a are
responsible for the high susceptibility of B95a to the Nagahata strain.

The common marmoset is a small New World primate that has attracted remarkable
attention as a potential experimental animal link between rodents and humans.
Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector-mediated expression of a disease-causing gene
or a potential therapeutic gene in the brain may allow the construction of a
marmoset model of a brain disorder or an exploration of the possibility of gene
therapy. To gain more insights into AAV vector-mediated transduction profiles in 
the marmoset central nervous system (CNS), we delivered AAV serotype 9 (AAV9)
vectors expressing GFP to the cisterna magna or the cerebellar cortex.
Intracisternally injected AAV9 vectors expanded in the CNS according to the
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow, by retrograde transport through neuronal axons or
via intermediary transcytosis, resulting in diffuse and global transduction
within the CNS. In contrast, cerebellar parenchymal injection intensely
transduced a more limited area, including the cerebellar cortex and cerebellar
afferents, such as neurons of the pontine nuclei, vestibular nucleus and inferior
olivary nucleus. In the spinal cord, both administration routes resulted in
labeling of the dorsal column and spinocerebellar tracts, presumably by
retrograde transport from the medulla oblongata and cerebellum, respectively.
Motor neurons and dorsal root ganglia were also transduced, possibly by diffusion
of the vector down the subarachnoid space along the cord. Thus, these two
administration routes led to distinct transduction patterns in the marmoset CNS, 
which could be utilized to generate different disease animal models and to
deliver therapeutic genes for the treatment of diseases affecting distinct brain 
areas.

An 8-month-old common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) was presented with tic-like
symptoms, and a 2-year-old pigmy marmoset (Callithrix pygmaea) was presented with
dyspnea and hypersalivation. Both monkeys died within a few days, and necropsies 
were performed. Histopathological examinations revealed ulcerative stomatitis
with epithelial cell swelling and eosinophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies in
the oral epithelium of both cases. In the central and peripheral nervous systems,
neuronal cell degeneration with intranuclear inclusion bodies was observed.
Immunohistochemical examination using anti-herpes simplex virus type 1 antibody
revealed virus antigens in both cases. Both animals had been kept as pets with
limited exposure to the ambient environment except via their owners. Therefore,
herpes simplex virus type-1 was probably acquired from close contact with their
owners.

OBJECTIVE: The common marmoset as a model of early obesity was assessed. The
hypotheses that juvenile marmosets with excess adipose tissue will display higher
fasting glucose, decreased insulin sensitivity, and decreased ability to clear
glucose from the blood stream were tested.
DESIGN AND METHODS: Normal and obese (body fat > 14%) common marmoset infants (N 
= 39) were followed up from birth until 1 year. Body fat was measured by
quantitative magnetic resonance. Circulating glucose was measured by glucometer
and insulin, adiponectin, and leptin by commercial assays. The quantitative
insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI; a measure of insulin sensitivity) was
calculated for subjects with fasting glucose and insulin measures. Oral glucose
tolerance tests (OGTTs) were conducted at 12 months on 35 subjects.
RESULTS: At 6 months, obese subjects already had significantly lower insulin
sensitivity (mean QUICKI = 0.378 ± 0.029 vs. 0.525 ± 0.019, N = 11, P = 0.003).
By 12 months, obese subjects also had higher fasting glucose (129.3 ± 9.1 mg/dL
vs. 106.1 ± 6.5 mg/dL, P = 0.042), and circulating adiponectin tended to be lower
(P = 0.057). Leptin was associated with percent body fat; however, birth weight
also influenced circulating leptin. The OGTT results demonstrated that obese
animals had a decreased ability to clear glucose.
CONCLUSIONS: Early-onset obesity in marmosets results in impaired glucose
homeostasis by 1 year.

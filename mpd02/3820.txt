The cholinergic hypothesis of memory dysfunction originally proposed that
dysfunction of cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain cholinergic system
(BFCS) may be responsible for the memory deficits associated with aging and
Alzheimer's disease (AD). This hypothesis directed focus on the BFCS in
experimental animal models of AD. In contrast to numerous studies in rodents,
fewer investigations have been conducted in monkeys with BFCS lesions. The
medical septal nucleus/nucleus of the diagonal band of Broca (MS/NDBB) and the
nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM) may be involved in different cognitive functions
in monkeys. Although few investigations have specifically addressed the issue of 
cognitive functions of the MS/NDBB in monkeys, there is some indication that
these regions may be important for memory. In contrast, lesions of the NBM do not
consistently disrupt mnemonic functions in monkeys. Recent electrophysiological
and lesion studies of monkeys indicate that the NBM may play a more important
role in attention functions, impairments of which are an early and significant
feature of patients with AD.

On Being a Monkey's Uncle: Germline Chimerism in the Callitrichinae and the
Evolution of Sibling Rivalry.

Patten MM.

AbstractA typical monkey of the subfamily Callitrichinae has two or more cell
lineages occupying its tissues: one from "itself," and one from its co-twin(s).
Chimerism originates in utero when the twin placentae fuse, vascular anastomoses 
form between them, and cells are exchanged between conceptuses through their
shared circulation. Previously it was thought that chimerism was limited to
tissues of the hematopoietic cell lineage and that the germline was clonal, but
subsequent empirical work has shown that chimerism may extend to many tissues,
including the germline. To explore how natural selection on chimeric organisms
should shape their social behavior, I construct an inclusive fitness model of
sibling interactions that permits differing degrees of chimerism in the soma and 
germline. The model predicts that somatic chimerism should diminish sibling
rivalry but that germline chimerism should typically intensify it. A further
implication of the model is the possibility for intraorganismal conflict over
developing phenotypes; as tissues may differ in their extent of chimerism-for
example, placenta versus brain-their respective inclusive fitness may be
maximized by different phenotypes. Communication between tissues in chimeric
organisms might therefore be noisy, rapidly evolving, and fraught, as is common
in systems with internal evolutionary conflicts of interest.

OBJECTIVE: Mumps virus is isolated in Vero cells and, recently, B95a cells have
been reported to be susceptible to it. Currently circulating wild-type mumps
virus strains (genotypes B, G, J and L) induced cytopathic effects in both Vero
and B95a cells. On the other hand, the Hoshino vaccine strain (KO3) did not
induce cytopathic effects in B95a cells. In this study, differences in fusion
inducibility were investigated.
METHODS: Nucleotide sequences of the fusion (F) and hemagglutinin-neuraminidase
(HN) protein regions were compared. The F and HN expression plasmids were
constructed and fusion analysis was conducted, using recombinant F expression
plasmids under the control of T7 RNA polymerase.
RESULTS: Extensive cell fusion was observed when B95a cells were transfected with
the wild-type F expression plasmid as the F expression partner; 13-16 amino acid 
differences were observed in the F protein region between the KO3 and the wild
types. F expression plasmids with leucine at position 383 of the F protein
induced large cell fusion in B95a cells.
CONCLUSION: Leucine at position 383 of the F protein of the wild types was the
critical amino acid for fusion inducibility in B95a cells.

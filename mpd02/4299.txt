Formation of polar conjugates is a well documented metabolic pathway for
xenobiotics containing phenolic hydroxyl groups. This paper describes the
analysis of two sulphate ester conjugates by fast atom bombardment mass
spectrometry and thermospray liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Thermospray
liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry proved the more successful technique for 
obtaining the molecular weight of the intact conjugate, but only by removal of
the buffer from the high-performance liquid chromatography eluent.

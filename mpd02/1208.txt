Folate receptors α (FRα) and β (FRβ) are two isoforms of the cell surface
glycoprotein that binds folate. The expression of FRα is rare in normal cells and
elevated in cancer cells. Thus, FRα-based tumor-targeted therapy has been a focus
area of laboratory research and clinical trials. Recently, it was shown that a
significant fraction of tumor-associated macrophages expresses FRβ and that these
cells can enhance tumor growth. Although FRα and FRβ share 70% identity in their 
deduced amino acid sequence, a monoclonal antibody (MAb) reactive with both
receptors has not been developed. A MAb that can target both FRα-expressing
cancer cells and FRβ-expressing tumor-associated macrophages may provide a more
potent therapeutic tool for cancer than individual anti-FRα or anti-FRβ MAbs. In 
this study, we developed a MAb that recognizes both FRα and FRβ (anti-FRαβ). The 
anti-FRαβ specifically stained trophoblasts and macrophages from human placenta, 
synovial macrophages from rheumatoid arthritis patient, liver macrophages from
cynomolgus monkey and common marmoset, and cancer cells and tumor-associated
macrophages from ovary and lung carcinomas. Surface plasmon resonance showed that
the anti-FRαβ bound to soluble forms of the FRα and FRβ proteins with high
affinity (KD=6.26×10(-9) M and 4.33×10(-9) M, respectively). In vitro functional 
analysis of the anti-FRαβ showed that this MAb mediates complement-dependent
cytotoxicity, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, and antibody-dependent
cellular phagocytosis of FRα-expressing and FRβ-expressing cell lines. The
anti-FRαβ MAb is a promising therapeutic candidate for cancers in which
macrophages promote tumor progression.

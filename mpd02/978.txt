OBJECTIVES: Undoubted fossil Cebidae have so far been primarily documented from
the late middle Miocene of Colombia, the late Miocene of Brazilian Amazonia, the 
early Miocene of Peruvian Amazonia, and very recently from the earliest Miocene
of Panama. The evolutionary history of cebids is far from being well-documented, 
with notably a complete blank in the record of callitrichine stem lineages until 
and after the late middle Miocene (Laventan SALMA). Further documenting their
evolutionary history is therefore of primary importance.
MATERIAL: Recent field efforts in Peruvian Amazonia (Contamana area, Loreto
Department) have allowed for the discovery of an early late Miocene (ca. 11 Ma;
Mayoan SALMA) fossil primate-bearing locality (CTA-43; Pebas Formation). In this 
study, we analyze the primate material, which consists of five isolated teeth
documenting two distinct Cebidae: Cebus sp., a medium-sized capuchin (Cebinae),
and Cebuella sp., a tiny marmoset (Callitrichinae).
RESULTS: Although limited, this new fossil material of platyrrhines contributes
to documenting the post-Laventan evolutionary history of cebids, and besides
testifies to the earliest occurrences of the modern Cebuella and Cebus/Sapajus
lineages in the Neotropics. Regarding the evolutionary history of callitrichine
marmosets, the discovery of an 11 Ma-old fossil representative of the modern
Cebuella pushes back by at least 6 Ma the age of the Mico/Cebuella divergence
currently proposed by molecular biologists (i.e., ca. 4.5 Ma). This also extends 
back to > 11 Ma BP the divergence between Callithrix and the common ancestor (CA)
of Mico/Cebuella, as well as the divergence between the CA of marmosets and
Callimico (Goeldi's callitrichine).
DISCUSSION: This discovery from Peruvian Amazonia implies a deep evolutionary
root of the Cebuella lineage in the northwestern part of South America (the
modern western Amazon basin), slightly before the recession of the Pebas
mega-wetland system (PMWS), ca. 10.5 Ma, and well-before the subsequent
establishment of the Amazon drainage system (ca. 9-7 Ma). During the late
middle/early late Miocene interval, the PMWS was seemingly not a limiting factor 
for dispersals and widespread distribution of terrestrial mammals, but it was
also likely a source of diversification via a complex patchwork of
submerged/emerged lands varying through time.

Video-tape recordings were made of behavioural interactions in eight family
groups of marmosets for 24-30 days after parturition. Blood samples were
collected from females for measurement of plasma luteinizing hormone (LH) and
progesterone. A pre-ovulatory LH surge occurred in six females between days 10-18
(mean +/- sem, 13.8 +/- 1.3 days). In these groups, sexual interactions increased
in frequency during the post-partum period and males began to initiate mounts on 
days 1, 2, 2, 6, 8 and 10 respectively. Mount and ejaculation frequencies
increased significantly during the peri-ovulatory phase as compared to the
pre-ovulatory phase and females were more proceptive and receptive than in the
early post-partum period. Peri-ovulatory increases in sexual activity were more
pronounced in 3 groups in which females had failed to conceive. In the remaining 
3 groups, sexual interactions tended to continue at higher levels into the
post-ovulatory phase when the females were pregnant. In captive marmoset groups, 
copulatory behaviour during the post-partum period is stimulated by changes in
non-behavioural cues from the female (increased sexual attractiveness to the
male) as well as by changes in her behaviour (proceptivity, receptivity) which
vary in importance between individuals.

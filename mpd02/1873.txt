The aim of this study was to estimate the number of new cells and neurons added
to the dentate gyrus across the lifespan, and to compare the rate of
age-associated decline in neurogenesis across species. Data from mice (Mus
musculus), rats (Rattus norvegicus), lesser hedgehog tenrecs (Echinops telfairi),
macaques (Macaca mulatta), marmosets (Callithrix jacchus), tree shrews (Tupaia
belangeri), and humans (Homo sapiens) were extracted from 21 data sets published 
in 14 different reports. Analysis of variance (ANOVA), exponential, Weibull, and 
power models were fit to the data to determine which best described the
relationship between age and neurogenesis. Exponential models provided a suitable
fit and were used to estimate the relevant parameters. The rate of decrease of
neurogenesis correlated with species longevity (r = 0.769, p = 0.043), but not
body mass or basal metabolic rate. Of all the cells added postnatally to the
mouse dentate gyrus, only 8.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.0% to 14.7%) of
these will be added after middle age. In addition, only 5.7% (95% CI 0.7% to
9.9%) of the existing cell population turns over from middle age and onward.
Thus, relatively few new cells are added for much of an animal's life, and only a
proportion of these will mature into functional neurons.

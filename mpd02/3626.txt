Using a combination of iterative structure-based design and an analysis of oral
pharmacokinetics and antiviral activity, AG1343 (Viracept, nelfinavir mesylate), 
a nonpeptidic inhibitor of HIV-1 protease, was identified. AG1343 is a potent
enzyme inhibitor (Ki = 2 nM) and antiviral agent (HIV-1 ED50 = 14 nM). An X-ray
cocrystal structure of the enzyme-AG1343 complex reveals how the novel thiophenyl
ether and phenol-amide substituents of the inhibitor interact with the S1 and S2 
subsites of HIV-1 protease, respectively. In vivo studies indicate that AG1343 is
well absorbed orally in a variety of species and possesses favorable
pharmacokinetic properties in humans. AG1343 (Viracept) has recently been
approved for marketing for the treatment of AIDS.

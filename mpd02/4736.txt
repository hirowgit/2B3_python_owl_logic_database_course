Radiographic evaluation of appendicular skeletal maturation in the common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).

Schultea TD, Smallwood JE, Stott GG.

The thoracic appendicular skeletal development of five common marmosets was
monitored radiographically at weekly intervals from 1 day to 94 weeks of age and 
the times of appearance and fusion of 47 ossification centers were recorded. A
range and average age for the appearance and fusion of each ossification center
were calculated and compared to data available for the rhesus monkey and man.

While pregnancy-related proteins (PRP) are known to contribute to immunotolerance
during pregnancy, their significance to development of invasive placenta is
unclear. We compared PRP expression in humans and the common marmoset (Callithrix
jacchus), a new-world monkey. Invasive placenta was observed at the
maternal-foetal interface of marmoset placenta from green fluorescent protein
(GFP)-expressing foetus and wild type mother. The pregnancy zone protein (PZP)
and alpha-2 macroglobulin-like 1 (A2ML1) proteins exhibited the most prominent
increase in expression during the second trimester in humans and marmoset,
respectively. In humans, PZP accumulated at the maternal-foetal interface and
A2ML1 accumulated in the amnion. Similarly, A2ML1 mRNA was detected in marmoset
placenta. These proteins belong to the A2M family of protease inhibitors, and
both PZP and A2ML1 share around 90% homology between human and marmoset and have 
highly conserved structures. However, the protease-reacting bait regions of the
proteins had lower homology (56.8-60.7% in proteins) relative to the rest of the 
sequence. Notably, the cleavage site of a proinflammatory proline-endopeptidase
was preserved in human PZP and marmoset A2ML1. These proteins contain multiple
sites that are cleaved by proteases involving proline-endopeptidase. Systemic
regulation of these A2M family proteins may be important in animals with invasive
placenta.

The mouse is often criticized as a model for pregnancy research as gestation is
short, with much of organ development completed postnatally. There are also
differences in the structure and physiology of the placenta between mouse and
human. This review considers eight alternative models that recently have been
proposed and two established ones that seem underutilized. A promising newcomer
among rodents is the spiny mouse, which has a longer gestation than the mouse
with organogenesis complete at birth. The guinea pig is also recommended both
because it has well-developed neonates and because there is a wealth of
information on pregnancy and placentation in the literature. Several smaller
primates are considered. The mouse lemur has its advocates yet is less suited as 
a model for human pregnancy as its young are altricial, placentation very
different from that of humans, and husbandry requirements not fully assessed. In 
contrast, the common marmoset, a New World monkey, has well-developed neonates
and is kept at many primate centres. Marmoset placenta has some features that
closely resemble human placentation, such as the interhaemal barrier, although it
is uncertain if invasion of the uterine arteries occurs in this species. In
conclusion, pregnancy research would benefit greatly from increased use of
alternative models such as the spiny mouse and common marmoset.

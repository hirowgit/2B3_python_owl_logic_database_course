Calcium-binding proteins can act as intermediaries between changing levels of
free intracellular calcium ions and the physiological response of neurons. Some
of these proteins, among them calbindin (CB), calretinin (CR) and parvalbumin
(PV), can act as calcium buffers. A survey of previous studies in rodents and
human fetuses leads to the impression that many spiral ganglion cells co-express 
CB, CR, and PV. The findings of the present study suggest that, in the adult
marmoset, the expression of CB is restricted to a small number of cells, most
likely type II ganglion cells, and that at least some of the numerous type I
ganglion cells co-express CR and PV. In the neonate marmoset, large numbers of
putative type I ganglion cells from the apical cochlear turn transiently
expressed a light and granular labeling for CB-like immunoreactivity, in addition
to the cells we believe to be type II ganglion cells exhibiting a strong and
solid CB-like staining. The spiral ganglion cells in all developmental stages
co-expressed the mitochondrial enzyme cytochrome oxidase. Furthermore, a small
population of CB-LI axons of unknown origin was found to terminate near the
CB-immunoreactive ganglion cells.

The pharmacological profile of a new surmountable angiotensin AT1 receptor
antagonist, ME3221,
3-methoxy-2,6-dimethyl-4-[[2'-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)-1,1'-biphenyl-4-
yl]methoxy]pyridine, was studied in several animal models, and was compared with 
that of losartan. EF2831,
3-hydroxy-2,6-dimethyl-4-[[2'-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)-1,1'-biphenyl-4-
yl]methoxy]pyridine, a metabolite of ME3221, is also a surmountable angiotensin
AT1 receptor antagonist, whose potency was 1/30 that of ME3221 in vitro, but
equal to or 1/3 of that of ME3221 in in vivo experiments. In rats and marmosets, 
ME3221 antagonized angiotensin II-induced pressor responses, but did not affect
bradykinin-induced depressor responses. ME3221 lowered the blood pressure in
renal hypertensive rats and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), and its ED25
value was 3 times that of losartan. Repeated administration of ME3221 to SHR had 
a stable and long-lasting antihypertensive effect without influencing heart rate.
Thus ME3221, like losartan, may be useful in the treatment of renal and essential
hypertension.

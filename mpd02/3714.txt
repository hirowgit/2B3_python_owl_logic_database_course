The distribution of neurones that could be stained immunohistochemically with
antibody to the p75 neurotrophin protein was studied in the forebrain of the
common marmoset. The p75-immunoreactive forebrain cells appear to correspond to
choline acetyltransferase-immunoreactive (i.e., cholinergic) neurones. Two
populations of cells could be distinguished on the basis of the intensity of p75 
immunostaining. Moderately stained cells correspond to cholinergic interneurones 
of the caudate and putamen, while intensely stained cells correspond to the
cholinergic neurones projecting to the cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus, located
in the septum, diagonal band, and basal nucleus of Meynert. The distribution of
cells of the diagonal band/basal nucleus complex is more extensive in the
marmoset than in other primate species, extending into parts of the
postcommissural fornix via the posterior septum, and by small projections dorsal 
to the anterior commissure and via the thalamic fasciculus from the basal
nucleus; the posterior extent of the basal nucleus continues extensively into the
lamina between the globus pallidus and the putamen.

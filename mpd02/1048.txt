The neuropeptide oxytocin is part of a neuroendocrine system that has
physiological effects ranging from ensuring uterine myometrial contractions at
parturition and post-partum mammary gland milk ejection to the modulation of
neural control of social relationships. This initial study was performed to
investigate the potential use of positron emission tomography (PET) for
localizing oxytocin receptors in two New World primates. Three biomarkers for PET
(1-3) that are known to have high affinity and selectivity for the human oxytocin
receptor were investigated in the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) via PET
imaging. Brain penetration, and uptake in the salivary gland area were both
observed with biomarkers 2 and 3. No brain penetration was observed with 1, but
uptake was observed more specifically in several peripheral endocrine glands
compared to 2 or 3. Biomarker 2, which displayed the best brain penetration of
the three biomarkers in the marmoset, was then investigated in the monogamous
coppery titi monkey (Callicebus cupreus) in a brain scan and a limited full body 
scan. No significant brain penetration of 2 was observed in the titi monkey, but 
significant uptake was observed in various locations throughout the periphery.
Metabolism of 2 was suspected to have been significant based upon HPLC analysis
of blood draws, but parent compound was still present near the end of the scan.
Follow-up investigations will focus on next generation biomarkers bearing
improved binding characteristics and brain penetrability as well as investigating
tissue in regions where biomarker uptake was observed.

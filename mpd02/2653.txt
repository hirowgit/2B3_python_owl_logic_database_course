Ultrasonographic examinations were performed on 17 clinically healthy adult
common marmosets to gain information about the normal abdominal echoanatomy. The 
marmosets were 1.5-9 years of age and weighed between 328 and 506g. Marked
species-specific differences compared with the cat or dog were noted. Good images
of the kidneys, bladder, spleen, adrenal glands, liver, and the gastrointestinal 
tract could be obtained. The pancreas, caecum, and abdominal lymph nodes were not
seen. The spleen was the least echogenic organ, followed by the medium echogenic 
liver and the sometimes isoechoic, but mostly hyperechoic renal cortex. The
kidneys had a poor corticomedullary distinction. The prominent right lobes of the
liver extended caudally far beyond the costal arch. The gallbladder had a bi- to 
multi-lobed appearance with a wide, tortuous cystic duct. The pylorus was
centrally positioned. The adrenal glands were readily seen, but should not be
confused with the adjacent spleen. A statistically significant (P<0.05)
difference between female and male kidney, and right adrenal gland length was
present.

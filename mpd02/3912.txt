The present investigation was designed to determine the organization of
somatosensory fields in the lateral sulcus of macaque monkeys using standard
microelectrode recording techniques. Our results provide evidence for two
complete representations of the body surface. We term these fields the second
somatosensory area (SII) and the parietal ventral area (PV) because of their
similarities in position, internal organization, and relationship to anterior
parietal fields, as described for SII and PV in other mammals. Areas SII and PV
are mirror-symmetrical representations of the body surface, sharing a common
boundary at the representations of the digits of the hand and foot, lips, and
mouth. These fields are located adjacent to the face representations of anterior 
parietal fields (areas 3b, 1, and 2), and are bounded ventrally and caudally by
other regions of cortex in which neurons are responsive to somatic or multimodal 
stimulation. The finding of a double representation of the body surface in the
region of cortex traditionally designated as SII may explain conflicting
descriptions of SII organization in macaque monkeys. In addition, the present
study raises some questions regarding the designation of serial processing
pathways in Old World monkeys, by suggesting that fields may have been confused
in studies demonstrating such pathways. We propose that SII and PV are components
of a common plan of organization, and are present in many eutherian mammals.

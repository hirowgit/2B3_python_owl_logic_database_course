Epstein-Barr virus: experimental infection of Callithrix jacchus marmosets.

Falk L, Deinhardt F, Wolfe L, Johnson D, Hilgers J, de-Th√© G.

Eight common marmoset monkeys (Callithrix jacchus) were inoculated with about
10(4) transforming units of B95-8 virus; seven of the marmosets died 50-111 days 
post inoculation and all seven showed microscopic and/or macroscopic lesions
compatible with a diagnosis of lymphoproliferative disease. Low levels of
anti-VCA antibodies were detected in plasma from six marmosets. Attempts failed
to establish continuous EBV-carrying lymphoblastoid cell cultures by cultivation 
in vitro of circulating lymphocytes or minced lymphoid tissues obtained at
necropsy.

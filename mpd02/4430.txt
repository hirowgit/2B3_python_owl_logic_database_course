Male Sprague-Dawley rats and marmosets were given a single oral 25 mg/kg dose of 
[3-14C]coumarin and the excretion of radioactivity in the expired air, urine and 
faeces monitored up to 96 h. Excretion profiles were similar in both species with
the bulk of the dose being excreted in the urine and faeces within 24 h.
Chromatographic analysis of 0-48 h urine samples revealed similar metabolic
profiles with only small amounts of unchanged coumarin and very little
7-hydroxycoumarin. Coumarin 7-hydroxylase activity was not detectable in hepatic 
microsomes from either species. These results demonstrate that the disposition of
[3-14C]coumarin was similar in the rat and marmoset, a New World primate, and
that both species, unlike man, are poor 7-hydroxylators of coumarin.

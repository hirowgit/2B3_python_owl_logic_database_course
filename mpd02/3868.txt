Previous immunocytochemical studies in rats have indicated that striatal dopamine
depletion leads to an increase in enkephalin-immunoreactivity and a decrease in
substance P-immunoreactivity in the striatum. Similar studies in primates have
lead to contradictory results. In the present study changes in tyrosine
hydroxylase-, met-enkephalin- and substance P-immunoreactivity were determined in
the basal ganglia of 6 common marmosets Callithrix jacchus following dopamine
depletion by unilateral intracerebral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) injections using
three different survival times. The non-lesioned side served as an
intra-individual control. Tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity was strongly
reduced in the entire ipsilateral striatum. Enkephalin-immunoreactivity was
increased throughout the striatum. Substance P-immunoreactivity was significantly
increased in only one case in the caudate nucleus and in two cases in the
putamen, while in other cases either a non-significant increase or decrease was
found. Therefore, the results of the present study indicate that in marmosets
dopamine has a inhibiting effect on the levels of striatal enkephalin, while its 
effect on substance P (SP) appears to be absent.

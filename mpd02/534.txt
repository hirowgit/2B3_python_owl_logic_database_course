Viral vectors enable foreign proteins to be expressed in brains of non-genetic
species, including non-human primates. However, viruses targeting specific neuron
classes have proved elusive. Here we describe viral promoters and strategies for 
accessing GABAergic interneurons and their molecularly defined subsets in the
rodent and primate. Using a set intersection approach, which relies on two
co-active promoters, we can restrict heterologous protein expression to cortical 
and hippocampal somatostatin-positive and parvalbumin-positive interneurons. With
an orthogonal set difference method, we can enrich for subclasses of
neuropeptide-Y-positive GABAergic interneurons by effectively subtracting the
expression pattern of one promoter from that of another. These methods harness
the complexity of gene expression patterns in the brain and significantly expand 
the number of genetically tractable neuron classes across mammals.

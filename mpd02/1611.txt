In this study, we examined the dynamics of cellular immune responses in the acute
phase of dengue virus (DENV) infection in a marmoset model. Here, we found that
DENV infection in marmosets greatly induced responses of CD4/CD8 central memory T
and NKT cells. Interestingly, the strength of the immune response was greater in 
animals infected with a dengue fever strain than in those infected with a dengue 
hemorrhagic fever strain of DENV. In contrast, when animals were re-challenged
with the same DENV strain used for primary infection, the neutralizing antibody
induced appeared to play a critical role in sterilizing inhibition against viral 
replication, resulting in strong but delayed responses of CD4/CD8 central memory 
T and NKT cells. The results in this study may help to better understand the
dynamics of cellular and humoral immune responses in the control of DENV
infection.

Stereotypy in monkeys and humans.

Ridley RM, Baker HF.

Stereotyped movements are described in monkeys and humans and are classified as
arising from constraint, sensory deprivation in infancy, amphetamine treatment or
psychotic states. It is argued that, with the exception of cage stereotypies,
stereotyped behaviour is evidence of abnormality in the nervous system consequent
upon distorted maturational processes, organic defect or biochemical disturbance.
Stereotypy is associated with a state of cognitive inflexibility and social and
sensory isolation in humans and monkeys. It is suggested that, while no simple
biochemical disturbance in the brain can describe these various occurrences of
stereotypy, the cross-species occurrence of a syndrome of isolation, cognitive
inflexibility and stereotypy implies a related mechanism mediating these
divergent effects. If stereotypy is regarded as a consequence of failure to use
sensory input to direct behaviour, therapeutic regimes designed to stimulate
responsive behaviours and social interactions are more likely to be effective in 
the long run than direct attempts to suppress stereotypy.

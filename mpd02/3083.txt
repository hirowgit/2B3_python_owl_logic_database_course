Few studies of body composition have been done in New World primates. In the
study reported here, four methods of assessing body composition (body weight,
anthropometry, labeled-water dilution, and total body electroconductivity) were
compared in 20 marmosets, aged 0.96 to 7.97 years. Males and females did not
differ in any measure (P > 0.05). Body weight ranged from 272 to 466 g, and body 
fat estimates varied from 1.6 to 19.5%. Strong positive correlations were
observed between total body water and total body electroconductivity (R2 = 0.77),
body weight and fat-free mass (males R2 = 0.95; females R2 = 0.91), and body
weight and fat mass (males R2 = 0.86; females R2 = 0.85; P < 0.01). Male and
female slopes were equivalent (P > 0.05) for the regressions of fat and fat-free 
mass against body weight. Positive correlations also were observed between girth 
measures and fat-free mass (R2 = 0.48 to 0.78) and fat mass (R2 = 0.60 to 0.74; P
< 0.01). A good second- order polynomial relationship was observed between age
and fat-free mass for the combined sample (R2 = 0.64). Results indicated that:
subjects were lean; there was no sexual dimorphism relative to measures; body
weight provided a reliable estimate of fat and fat-free mass; and within-subject 
body weight changes reflected a similar relationship between body weight and
fat-free mass as did that across subjects.

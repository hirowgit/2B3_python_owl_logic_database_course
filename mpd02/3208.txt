Callithrix jacchus, the common marmoset, is particularly suitable for
immunological studies in vivo and in vitro since many antibodies directed against
epitopes of human cells do also react with their analogues from this non-human
primate. We studied the reactivity of antibodies against human epitopes on
primary cultures of thymic epithelial cells from marmosets and humans by
flow-cytometry after different culture periods. The antibodies against integrins,
including CD61, reacted with thymic epithelial cells from both humans and
marmosets, as did anti-CD44 and anti-CD106. Antibodies specific for thymic
epithelial cells (TE-3, TE-4, TE-8, TE-15, TE-16, TE-19) also bound to cells from
marmosets but expression of all epitopes was not observed in all cultures
studied. The expression of CD51, CD54, CD58 and CD106 on human cells declined
after 4 weeks of culture. Our findings indicate that marmosets are a valuable
model for immunological studies of effects of xenobiotics on the thymic
epithelium.

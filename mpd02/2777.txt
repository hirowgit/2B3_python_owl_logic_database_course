The many, highly specific, biological therapies for immune-based diseases create 
a need for valid preclinical animal models. The wide immunological gap between
human beings and laboratory mouse or rat models makes many disease models in
these species invalid. In this review, we report a non-human-primate model of
chronic multiple sclerosis (MS)-experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE) in the
common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus)-that can help bridge this wide gap. The
genetic and immunological similarity of marmosets and human beings and the
clinical and neuropathological similarity of the EAE model to MS provide a unique
experimental platform for research into basic immunopathogenetic mechanisms and
for the development of more effective treatments for MS.

Eye preferences of the common marmoset ( Callithrix jacchus ) were examined,
taking into account age, arousal, and hand preference. Monocular eye use for
looking through a small hole at a stimulus was recorded. Of 21 marmosets, 20
displayed right-eye preferences for viewing a piece of familiar food. In subjects
tested at 3-8, 12, 15-18, and 22 months, eye preferences were consistent across
age. A group bias, indicative of right-eyedness, was also found for viewing other
stimuli. The stimuli included a watch, mirror, model of a beetle, and the
experimenter's hand. However, when the marmosets viewed a threatening stimulus, a
model resembling two rearing snakes, they displayed increased arousal (indicated 
by longer duration between monocular viewing events and increased incidence of
aroused vocalisations) and the eye preferences shifted away from a preference for
the right eye to either no preference or a left-eye preference. No relationship
between eye preference and hand preference for holding food was found. Therefore,
we suggest that eye preferences may reflect hemispheric specialisations for
perceptual processing, according to the emotional valence of the stimulus.

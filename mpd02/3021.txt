There is an increasing body of evidence to suggest that different functional
classes of neurones express characteristic cell-surface carbohydrates. Previous
studies have shown that the plant lectin Ulex europaeus agglutinin-I (UEA) binds 
to a population of small to medium diameter primary sensory neurones in rabbits
and humans. This suggests that a fucose-containing glycoconjugate may be
expressed by nociceptive primary sensory neurones. In order to determine the
extent to which this glycoconjugate is expressed by other species, in the current
study, we have examined the distribution of UEA-binding sites on primary sensory 
neurones in seven different mammals. Binding sites for UEA were associated with
the plasma membrane and cytoplasmic granules of small to medium dorsal root
ganglion cells and their axon terminals in laminae I-III of the grey matter of
the spinal cord, in the rabbit, cat and marmoset monkey. However, no binding was 
observed in either the dorsal root ganglia or spinal cord in the mouse, rat,
guinea pig or flying fox. These results indicate an inter-species variation in
the expression of cell-surface glycoconjugates on mammalian primary sensory
neurones.

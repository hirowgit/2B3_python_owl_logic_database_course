The purpose of this study was to evaluate a telemetry system for examining the
cardiovascular system in the conscious common marmoset. Parameters obtained were 
blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, ECG, body temperature and locomotor
activity, and these were continuously recorded on a data recorder via the
telemetry system and then processed by a computerized system. Diurnal rhythms of 
blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature and locomotor activity were observed
in this system. We studied the effects of astemizole (antihistamine) and
nicardipine (Ca2+ channel blocker) on cardiovascular parameters. Astemizole at 30
mg/kg (p.o.) and at 1 to 3 mg/kg (i.v.), prolonged QT interval and induced
ventricular extrasystole. Torsades de pointes occurred in one of three cases at 3
mg/kg (i.v.) and 30 mg/kg (p.o.), while it did not affect the blood pressure,
respiratory rate and body temperature. Nicardipine at 30 mg/kg (p.o.) caused
sustained hypotension and tachycardia. These results demonstrate the usefulness
of the telemetry system using the common marmoset for evaluating the
cardiovascular effects of drugs under physiological conditions.

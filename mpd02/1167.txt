The common marmoset has been increasingly used for research in the biomedical
field; however, there is little information available regarding effective methods
of anesthesia in this species. This study retrospectively analyzed 2 regimens of 
anesthesia induction: intramuscular injection of ketamine followed by inhalation 
of 5% sevoflurane, and intramuscular injection of midazolam, butorphanol and
ketamine followed by inhalation of 5% sevoflurane. Anesthetic depth did not reach
the surgical anesthesia stage in 7 out of 99 animals receiving the former
regimen, whereas there were only 2 such animals out of 273 receiving the latter
regimen. The latter regimen, when followed by maintenance anesthesia with 3%
sevoflurane inhalation, was successfully used in various nociceptive procedures. 
These results indicate that the injection of a combination of midazolam,
butorphanol and ketamine followed by inhalation of a high concentration of
sevoflurane is effective for anesthesia induction in marmosets.

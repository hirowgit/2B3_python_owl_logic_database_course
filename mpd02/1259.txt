The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a New World primate that is a useful 
model for medical studies. In this study, we report a convenient, reliable, and
noninvasive procedure to genotype a living common marmoset by using fingernails. 
This method was used to successfully genotype DNA by restriction fragment length 
polymorphism (RFLP) PCR without prior purification, by using the KOD FX PCR
enzyme kit. Additionally, there is no sample contamination from hematopoietic
chimera derived from fused placenta in utero. We compared chimeric levels between
various tissues in females with male littermates using quantitative fluorescent
(QF)-PCR to prepare a reliable DNA source for genetic analyses, such as
genotyping, gene mapping, or genomic sequencing. The chimerism detected appeared 
to be restricted to lymphatic tissues, such as bone marrow, thymus, spleen, lymph
nodes and blood cells. As a result, DNA from fingernails with the quick is the
best DNA source for genetic research in living marmosets.

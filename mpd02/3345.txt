This study examined the effects of depletion of dopamine from the caudate nucleus
of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), on tasks sensitive to prefrontal
damage (attentional set-shifting and spatial delayed response). There was a
marked impairment in performance on the spatial delayed response task, but
performance on the attentional set-shifting task was relatively preserved except 
for an impairment in re-engagement of a previously relevant perceptual dimension.
This pattern of impairment is distinct from that seen after excitotoxic lesions
of the prefrontal cortex and in patients with Parkinson's disease. Though it is
not possible to identify specific cognitive functions that are independent of
dopaminergic modulation of the caudate nucleus, due to the partial nature of the 
lesion, the results do provide insight into those cognitive processes that appear
most dependent on caudate dopamine.

Common marmosets are small New World primates that have been increasingly used in
biomedical research. This report presents efficient protocols for assessment of
the parameters of adaptive cell-mediated immunity in common marmosets, including 
the major subpopulations of lymphocytes and main markers of T- and B-cell
maturation and activation using flow cytometry with a multicolor panel of
fluorescently labelled antibodies. Blood samples from eight common marmosets were
stained with fluorescently labeled monoclonal antibodies against their population
markers (CD45, CD3, CD20, CD4, CD8) and lymphocyte maturation and activation
markers (CD69, CD62L, CD45RO, CD107a and CD27) and analyzed by flow cytometry.
Within the CD45+ population, 22.7±5.5% cells were CD3- CD20+ and 67.6±6.3% were
CD3+CD20-. The CD3+ subpopulation included 55.7±5.5% CD3+CD4+CD8- and 34.3±3.7%
CD3+CD4-CD8+ cells. Activation and maturation markers were expressed in the
following lymphocyte proportions: CD62L on 54.0±10.7% of CD3+CD4+ cells and
74.4±12.1% of CD3+CD8+ cells; CD69 on 2.7±1.2% of CD3+CD4+ cells and 1.2±0.5% of 
CD3+CD8+ cells; CD45RO on 1.6±0.6% of CD3+CD4+ cells and 1.8±0.7% of CD3+CD8+
cells; CD107a on 0.7±0.5% of CD3+CD4+ cells and 0.5±0.3% of CD3+CD8+ cells; CD27 
on 94.6±2.1% of CD3+ cells and 8.9±3.9% CD20+ cells. Female and male subjects
differed in the percentage of CD3+CD4+CD45RO+ cells (1.9±0.5 in females vs
1.1±0.2 in males; p < 0.05). The percentage of CD20+CD27+ cells was found to
highly correlate with animals' age (r = 0.923, p < 0.005). The basal parameters
of adaptive cell-mediated immunity in naïve healthy marmosets without markers of 
systemic immune activation were obtained. These parameters and the described
procedures are crucial in documenting the changes induced in common marmosets by 
prophylactic and therapeutic immune interventions.

Here we describe the properties of CP-154,526, a potent and selective nonpeptide 
antagonist of corticotropin (ACTH) releasing factor (CRF) receptors. CP-154,526
binds with high affinity to CRF receptors (Ki < 10 nM) and blocks CRF-stimulated 
adenylate cyclase activity in membranes prepared from rat cortex and pituitary.
Systemically administered CP-154,526 antagonizes the stimulatory effects of
exogenous CRF on plasma ACTH, locus coeruleus neuronal firing and startle
response amplitude. Potential anxiolytic activity of CP-154,526 was revealed in a
fearpotentiated startle paradigm. These data are presented in the context of
clinical findings, which suggest that CRF is hypersecreted in certain
pathological states. We propose that a CRF antagonist such as CP-154,526 could
affirm the role of CRF in certain psychiatric diseases and may be of significant 
value in the treatment of these disorders.

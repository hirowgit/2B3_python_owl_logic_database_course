BACKGROUND: Inherited and acquired marrow failure syndromes most commonly lead to
defect in myeloid and/or neutrophil differentiation and/or function. Besides
this, neutropenia induced by cancer-adjusted chemotherapy is a frequent clinical 
problem. In both cases, cell replacement therapy is a well-established, but due
to necessity of donors limited and perilous procedure. Therefore, autologous cell
replacement from patients' own marrow-derived cells lowers risk and bares new
possibilities for therapy. Since the immune system of the marmoset monkey is
known to show high similarity to humans, preclinical studies with these animals
bare high hopes for immunologic research and cell replacement therapy.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Marmoset-induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells (cj-iPSC)
were first cultivated on mouse embryonic feeder cells in medium containing
recombinant human vascular endothelial growth factor. After 13 days,
CD34+/vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR2)- cells were sorted, 
treated with interleukin (IL-3), thrombopoietin, and stem cell factor for 20 days
and further cultivated with granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and
IL-3 for 10 days.
RESULTS: CD34+/VEGFR2- cells could be generated in high amounts (39.65 ± 6.01%;
2.31 × 105 cells). Afterward, these hematopoietic progenitors could be
successfully differentiated into mature cj-iPSC-derived neutrophils showing
similar morphology, specific surface antigens, and neutrophil-specific gene
products and in vitro phagocytic activity.
CONCLUSION: cj-iPSC-derived neutrophils bare high hopes in hematologic cell
replacement therapy. They exhibit high morphologic similarity to native
neutrophils and present neutrophil-specific surface antigens, antimicrobial
proteins, and gene products yielding an auspicious approach for continuative
experiments including tests in living animals.

Transpositions of primate-specific Alu elements were applied as molecular
cladistic markers in a phylogenetic analysis of South American primates.
Seventy-four human and platyrrhine loci containing intronic Alu elements were PCR
screened in various New World monkeys and the human outgroup to detect the
presence of orthologous retrotransposons informative of New World monkey
phylogeny. Six loci revealed size polymorphism in the amplification pattern,
indicating a shared derived character state due to the presence of orthologous
Alu elements confirmed by subsequent sequencing. Three markers corroborate (1)
New World monkey monophyly and one marker supports each of the following
callitrichine relationships: (2) Callithrix and Cebuella are more closely related
to each other than to any other callitrichine, (3) the callitrichines form a
monophyletic clade including Callimico, and (4) the next living relatives to the 
callitrichines are Cebus, Saimiri, and Aotus.

The ability of engineering variants of hepatitis A virus (strain HM175) to
replicate in cell culture or to cause disease in marmosets was evaluated. Virus
variants were encoded by chimeric genomes constructed from infectious cDNA clones
of two viruses (wild type and cell-culture-adapted) which differed in their
ability to grow in vitro and to cause acute hepatitis in marmosets. Transfection 
and infectivity assays indicated that virus growth in vitro could be enhanced by 
subcloning the cell substrate prior to infection or by introducing multiple
combinations of two or more mutations into the wild type genome. Various chimeric
viruses induced liver enzyme elevations in marmosets, indicating that attenuation
of virulence also required multiple mutations.

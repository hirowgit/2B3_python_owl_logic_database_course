Common marmosets are suitable non-human primate models for many human diseases.
Standard values for blood parameters are required to evaluate physiological and
pathological situations. Two studies were conducted: study I to determine
standard values and study II to examine these under changed housing conditions.
In study I, all parameters for clinical chemistry were similar in range for both 
genders with these specifics: male marmosets had significantly higher total and
LDL cholesterol levels than females, whereas the mean corpuscular volume and the 
mean corpuscular haemoglobin were significantly lower than in females. In study
II, glucose, lymphocytes and salivary cortisol were significantly lower, and
faecal cortisol was increased during the change of housing conditions. In
conclusion, standard values for haematology and clinical chemistry for the common
marmoset were determined. Further on, parameters that are influenced by
relocation stress and its importance for experimental results are described.

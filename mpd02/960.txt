Brain/MINDS (Brain Mapping by Integrated Neurotechnologies for Disease Studies)
is a national brain project started by Japan in 2014. With the goal of developing
the common marmoset as a model animal for neuroscience, the project aims to build
a multiscale marmoset brain map, develop new technologies for experimentalists,
create transgenic lines for brain disease modeling, and integrate translational
findings from the clinical biomarker landscape. Brain/MINDS will collaborate with
global brain projects to share technologies and resources.

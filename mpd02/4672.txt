Delineation of lymphocyte subsets in lymph nodes of nonhuman primates.

Chalifoux LV, Schlossman SF, Letvin NL.

Monoclonal antibodies which recognize specific surface antigens on human
lymphocytes were used with an avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase technique to stain
lymph nodes from nonhuman primates. Cells in lymph nodes from three macaque
species and two new-world primate species could be stained to define T11, T4, T8,
and B1 lymphocyte subsets. This approach will facilitate the study of many
important spontaneous and experimentally induced diseases of nonhuman primates.

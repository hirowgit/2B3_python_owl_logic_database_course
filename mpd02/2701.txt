Infant marmosets and tamarins obtain solid food items from adults during and
after the time of weaning. In addition to providing nutrients, food transfers may
provide infants with the opportunity to learn about diet. The aim of this study
was to investigate patterns of begging and food transfer in captive groups of
common marmosets during tests with 1) palatable novel food, 2) unpalatable novel 
food, and 3) familiar food. Infants may gain an opportunity to learn about diet
breadth by preferentially begging for novel rather than familiar items, while
adults may facilitate infant learning by differing in their willingness to
transfer food depending upon the food's novelty or palatability. In this study,
infants exhibited more interest and begging with novel food items than with
familiar ones. However, food transfers were not more likely to occur with novel
foods than with familiar ones, and in fact adults were more likely to refuse
infant begging attempts with novel foods. The palatability of the food also did
not influence the rates of refusal and transfer: adults transferred palatable and
unpalatable novel foods with similar frequencies. These results suggest that
infant marmosets gain an opportunity to learn about diet breadth by begging for
novel foods, but adults do not preferentially transfer novel or palatable food
items.

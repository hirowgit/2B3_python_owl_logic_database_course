Detection of drug-induced ototoxicity in safety evaluation studies of novel
chemical entities is rarely attempted. Where such examinations are included, they
usually rely on reflex testing. The Brainstem Auditory Evoked Response can be
measured with the use of externally positioned electrodes, and it monitors
electrophysiologic responses to sound from the cochlear nerve and associated
structures of the 8th cranial nerve. These responses have been reproducibly
measured in sedated marmosets and the method shown to be a sensitive detector of 
hearing loss caused by loop diuretics or aminoglycoside antibiotics.
additionally, where hearing damage is reversible, recovery can also be monitored.
It is proposed that where a sensitive marker for ototoxicity is considered
necessary as part of a multifaceted study investigating in vivo drug safety, this
procedure may prove advantageous over existing methods.

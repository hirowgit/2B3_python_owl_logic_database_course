An Oropouche virus strain was isolated from a novel host (Callithrix sp.) in
Arinos, Minas Gerais State, southeastern Brazil. The virus was identified by
complement fixation test and confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain 
reaction. Phylogenetic analysis identified this strain as a genotype III isolate 
previously recognized only in Panama.

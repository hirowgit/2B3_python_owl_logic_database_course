The study reported here demonstrates the feasibility of presenting cognitive
tests from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) to
either marmosets or rhesus monkeys in their home cages. This location of testing 
offers opportunities for the measurement of additional indices, for example
spontaneous behaviour (Prowse et al. 1995) and electrophysiology (Pearce et al.
1998) as well as facilitating repeated test presentation. Results from 12
marmosets and 4 rhesus monkeys which have completed several sequences of an
eight-stage discrimination task involving simple discriminations, compound
discriminations and reversals are reported. The paradigm developed has
application in long-term studies. Tests from CANTAB have been used extensively in
normal humans (Robbins et al. 1994) as well as a range of patient groups (Owen et
al. 1992, Elliott et al. 1995) and to assess drug effects (Coull et al. 1996).
Additionally some of these tests have been presented to marmosets (Roberts et al.
1988) to examine neuropsychological functioning. This comparative approach
facilitates meaningful cross species comparison, particularly in the study of the
effects of pharmacological intervention.

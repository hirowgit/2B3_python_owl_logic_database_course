The susceptibility of common marmosets and cotton-top tamarins to infection by
HIV-2 in vivo was tested. One year and 19 months, respectively, post-inoculation,
sera taken from three of four animals from each species are reactive for HIV-2
antibodies and HIV-specific nucleotide sequences were demonstrated in short-term 
cultures of PBL from two cotton-top tamarins. The animals remain in good health.

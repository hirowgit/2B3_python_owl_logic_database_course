Using a conditioned food avoidance learning paradigm, six squirrel monkeys
(Saimiri sciureus) and six common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) were tested for 
their ability to (1) reliably form associations between visual or olfactory cues 
of a potential food and its palatability and (2) remember such associations over 
prolonged periods of time. We found (1) that at the group level both species
showed one-trial learning with the visual cues color and shape, whereas only the 
marmosets were able to do so with the olfactory cue, (2) that all individuals
from both species learned to reliably avoid the unpalatable food items within 10 
trials, (3) a tendency in both species for quicker acquisition of the association
with the visual cues compared with the olfactory cue, (4) a tendency for quicker 
acquisition and higher reliability of the aversion by the marmosets compared with
the squirrel monkeys, and (5) that all individuals from both species were able to
reliably remember the significance of the visual cues, color and shape, even
after 4 months, whereas only the marmosets showed retention of the significance
of the olfactory cues for up to 4 weeks. Furthermore, the results suggest that in
both species tested, illness is not a necessary prerequisite for food avoidance
learning but that the presumably innate rejection responses toward highly
concentrated but nontoxic bitter and sour tastants are sufficient to induce
robust learning and retention.

Vocalizations of common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) were examined under
experimental situations related to fear or anxiety. When marmosets were isolated 
in an unfamiliar environment, they frequently vocalized "tsik-egg" calls, which
were the combination calls of 'tsik' followed by several 'egg'. Tsik-egg calls
were also observed after treatment with the anxiogenic drug FG-7142 (20mg/kg,
sc). In contrast, when marmosets were exposed to predatory stimuli as
fear-evoking situations, they frequently vocalized tsik solo calls as well as
tsik-egg calls. These results suggest that marmosets dissociate the vocalization 
of tsik-egg and tsik calls under conditions related to fear/anxiety; tsik-egg
solo vocalizations were emitted under anxiety-related conditions (e.g., isolation
and anxiogenic drug treatment), whereas a mixed vocalization of tsik-egg and tsik
was emitted when confronted with fear-provoking stimuli (i.e., threatening
predatory stimuli). Tsik-egg call with/without tsik can be used as a specific
vocal index of fear/anxiety in marmosets, which allows us to understand the
neural mechanism of negative emotions in primate.

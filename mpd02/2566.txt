RATIONALE: Modafinil is increasingly used in sleep disturbances in general and in
neurodegenerative diseases and is recently being used in healthy people for
attention control. However, the application of modafinil is possibly not only
restricted to alertness enhancing effects. More insight in this compound may lead
to new applications. Not all behavioral aspects have been studied sufficiently;
therefore, more detailed investigations on modafinil's positive and aversive
behavioral effects are addressed in this paper.
OBJECTIVES: Determination of effects of modafinil in marmoset monkeys with
observational methods and with behavioral tests measuring locomotor activity,
hand-eye coordination, response to a threat situation and startle response.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two hours after oral administration of modafinil in doses 
of 50, 100, 150, and 225 mg/kg, animals were observed and tested in the
behavioral test systems.
RESULTS: Locomotor activity was increased after 100 mg/kg modafinil in the
Bungalow test and after 100, 150, and 225 mg/kg, as found in the movement
parameters of the human threat test. Moreover, modafinil showed anxiolytic-like
effects in the human threat test. No other side effects were observed, nor were
the hand-eye coordination and startle response affected.
CONCLUSIONS: Besides psychostimulation, modafinil has no aversive effects in the 
doses used in the domains measured. The potential anxiolytic-like effects of
modafinil may create new possibilities for the therapeutic use of modafinil.

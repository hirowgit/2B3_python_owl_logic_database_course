Animal models of rheumatoid arthritis are important in the elucidation of
etiopathogenic mechanisms of the disease and for the development of promising new
therapies. Species specificity of new biological compounds and their mode of
action preclude safety and efficacy testing in rodent models of disease. Nonhuman
primates (NHP) can fill this niche and provide the only relevant model. Over the 
last two decades models of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) were developed in the
rhesus monkey and the common marmoset. However, NHP are higher-order animals and 
complex sentient beings. So especially in models where pain is an intricate part 
of the disease, analgesia needs to be addressed because of ethical
considerations. In our model, a morphine-based pain relief was used that does not
interfere with the normal development of disease allowing us to evaluate
important mechanistic aspects of the arthritis.

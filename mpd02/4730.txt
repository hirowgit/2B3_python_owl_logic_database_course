Hematologic reference values have been established for captive adult red-bellied 
tamarins (Saguinus labiatus) by carrying out full blood counts and fibrinogen
estimations on 25 clinically normal animals. The only significant sex difference 
detected was in the reticulocyte count which was higher in females than in males.
The reference values were used to identify abnormal changes in the blood of nine 
clinical cases. Hypochromic anemia, neutrophilia, and raised fibrinogen levels
were found in animals with self-inflicted injuries, dermatitis, and ileocecal
intussusception. Target cells and jaundiced plasma were noted in a case of
yersiniosis. Two animals in which generalized muscle wasting was the main
abnormal clinical sign were severely anemic, and in one of these cases a
significant number of Heinz bodies was present. The findings in these two animals
were compared with those in common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) with possible
wasting marmoset syndrome.

The influence of the kappa-opioid receptor agonist, enadoline, on endogenous
glutamate release was investigated in rat and marmoset striatal synaptosomes.
Enadoline decreased 4-aminopyridine (2 mM)-stimulated glutamate release (rat:
IC50 approximately 8.7 microM, marmoset: IC50 approximately 2.9 microM). The
effect of enadoline was reversed by nor-binaltorphimine (5 microM). These data
indicate that, in the striatum of the rat and marmoset, kappa-opioid receptor
agonists can modulate glutamate release. These findings may have implications for
the treatment of Parkinson's disease.

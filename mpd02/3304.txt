Huntington's disease is a genetically inherited neurodegenerative disorder for
which currently there is no effective treatment or cure. In order to gauge the
potential therapeutic benefits of neuroprotective or restorative treatments, it
is necessary to create an animal model that is associated with readily measurable
and long-lasting functional impairments. The undifferentiated neostriatum and
limited behavioural repertoire of rodents have led to the extension of our
investigations into the common marmoset. We have used quinolinic acid to create
unilateral excitotoxic lesions of the caudate nucleus or the putamen in this
small non-human primate. Following rigorous investigation of each monkey on a
battery of behavioural tests, we found that the unilateral putamen lesion was
associated with a contralateral motor impairment that persisted for at least 9
months and withstood repeated testing. However, the unilateral caudate nucleus
lesion did not appear to be associated with any detectable motor deficit. The
stability and the reproducibility of the unilateral putamen lesion in the
marmoset provide a suitable tool for the investigation of potential treatments
for neurodegenerative disorders that attack this region of the brain.

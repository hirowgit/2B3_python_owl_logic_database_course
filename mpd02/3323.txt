A fully automated high-performance liquid chromatography method with fluorescence
detection for the determination of the renin inhibitor CGP 60536 in animal and
human plasma and urine has been developed and validated. After addition of an
internal standard, the compounds were automatically extracted from 400 microl of 
plasma or urine with methyl alcohol-acetic acid (99:1, v/v) on 100-mg Bond-Elut
CN cartridges using the Gilson ASPEC system. The on-line chromatographic
separation was performed on a LiChrospher 100 RP8 5-microm particle size packed
analytical column (25x0.4 cm I.D.). The mobile phase consisted of
acetonitrile-0.01 M potassium dihydrogenphosphate (65:35, v/v) at a flow-rate of 
0.8 ml/min. The analytes were detected using a fluorescence detector at
excitation and emission wavelengths of 280 and 330 nm, respectively. The limit of
quantitation was established at 4.5 ng/ml in plasma (accuracy 106% and precision 
1%), and 9.0 ng/ml in urine (accuracy 101% and precision 13%). The method was
applied to the investigation of the pharmacokinetics of CGP 60536.

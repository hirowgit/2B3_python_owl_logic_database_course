The black-tailed marmoset (Callithrix argentata melanura) occurs in
central-western Brazil and adjacent parts of Bolivia, and is the only member of
the genus (Callithrix) to occur naturally outside Brazil. Data presented in this 
paper extend the range of this marmoset at least 200 km to the southwest into yet
another country, Paraguay.

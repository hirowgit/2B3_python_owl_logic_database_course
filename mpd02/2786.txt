Metabolic syndrome has been recognised as a cluster of risk factors contributing 
to the development of cardiovascular diseases. Different diagnostic criteria have
been proposed and the consensus focuses on four major risk factors: obesity,
diabetes, dyslipidaemia and hypertension. Although treatment options are
available to treat each component separately, a highly effective agent for
metabolic syndrome has yet to be developed. To explore the clinical definition of
metabolic syndrome and potential molecular targets that can be modulated for
treatment purpose, a meeting entitled 'Targeting Metabolic Syndrome' was
organised in 2004 by IBC USA Conferences, Inc. This article highlights
discussions related to the clinical correlates and pathophysiology of metabolic
syndrome, and reviews some of the promising drug discovery efforts. Metabolic
syndrome should be treatable and preventable if obesity and insulin resistance
are well controlled. New regulatory guidelines need to be developed as new
treatment options are being investigated. From a broad spectrum of potential
mechanisms encompassing central nervous system targets and peripheral targets for
pharmacological intervention, a few promising molecular targets have emerged.
Modulating these is expected to treat at least some components of metabolic
syndrome.

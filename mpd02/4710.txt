Baskerville M, Wood M, Baskerville A.

An outbreak of Bordetella bronchiseptica pneumonia occurred in a breeding colony 
of common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus). 16 animals, all except one under 12
months of age, died suddenly. Extensive lesions of pneumonia and pleurisy were
found at necropsy and B. bronchiseptica was isolated from the nasopharynx,
trachea and lungs. Older animals had only a mild rhinitis. Colonization of the
nasal mucosa occurred in 71 of 156 marmosets.

The common marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus) was used as a primate model for
the study of the expression of the estradiol synthesizing enzymes
17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 and type 7 (17HSD1 and 17HSD7). The
tissue-specific expression of 17HSD1 and 17HSD7 mRNA in Callithrix jacchus and
human as shown by Northern Blot analysis revealed strong similarities between the
two species. After cloning of the marmoset-specific coding cDNA sequence of
17HSD7 a similarity of 95% to the known human sequences was found. To elucidate
the physiological function of 17HSD7 which is thought to be different to that of 
the well-known 17HSD1, the regulation of 17HSD7 expression in the corpus luteum
was investigated. It was shown to be upregulated during the luteal phase of the
reproductive cycle and during early pregnancy, when the primate corpus luteum is 
most active in estradiol synthesis, whereas 17HSD1 was not detectable in this
tissue at any time.

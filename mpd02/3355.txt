Previous studies have suggested that prolactin may play a role in regulating
allocare behaviour in cotton-top tamarins, Saguinus oedipus. In this study, we
investigate the prolactin profile of 3 groups of captive common marmosets,
Callithrix jacchus. Carrying behaviour in this species was observed after
parturition. Prolactin assays of blood samples of both fathers and helpers
(sub-adult non-fathers) in 3 family groups were taken for 8 weeks before and
after birth of the infants. The after-birth condition was divided into 2 groups: 
carrying and non-carrying animals. The results suggest a relationship between
prolactin levels and allocare behaviour, with carrying behaviour being associated
with increased prolactin in both fathers and helpers. This suggests that extra
prolactin is produced in response to physical contact, and may be associated with
carrying behaviour. Also, prolactin production may be related to learning
parental skills in Neotropical primates.

Slow brain rhythms are attributed to near-simultaneous (synchronous) changes in
activity in neuron populations in the brain. Because they are slow and
widespread, synchronous rhythms have not been considered crucial for information 
processing in the waking state. Here we adapted methods from turbulence physics
to analyze δ-band (1-4 Hz) rhythms in local field potential (LFP) activity, in
multielectrode recordings from cerebral cortex in anesthetized marmoset monkeys. 
We found that synchrony contributes only a small fraction (less than one-fourth) 
to the local spatiotemporal structure of δ-band signals. Rather, δ-band activity 
is dominated by propagating plane waves and spatiotemporal structures, which we
call complex waves. Complex waves are manifest at submillimeter spatial scales,
and millisecond-range temporal scales. We show that complex waves can be
characterized by their relation to phase singularities within local nerve cell
networks. We validate the biological relevance of complex waves by showing that
nerve cell spike rates are higher in presence of complex waves than in the
presence of synchrony and that there are nonrandom patterns of evolution from one
type of complex wave to another. We conclude that slow brain rhythms
predominantly indicate spatiotemporally organized activity in local nerve cell
circuits, not synchronous activity within and across brain regions.

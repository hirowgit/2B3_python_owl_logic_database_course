Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of
migraine. Early chemistry leads suffered from modest potency, significant CYP3A4 
inhibition, and poor aqueous solubility. Herein, we describe the optimization of 
these leads to give 4 (BMS-694153), a molecule with outstanding potency, a
favorable predictive toxicology profile, and remarkable aqueous solubility.
Compound 4 has good intranasal bioavailability in rabbits and shows
dose-dependent activity in validated in vivo and ex vivo migraine models.

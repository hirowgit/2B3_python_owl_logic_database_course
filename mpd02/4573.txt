Platelet measurements in the common marmoset, Callithrix jacchus.

Evans GO, Smith DE.

Platelet counts and mean platelet volumes were determined for 39 male and 32
female adult marmoset whole blood samples and these results are compared with
previously published data. There is no evidence of a difference between sexes but
there is some evidence of a relationship between platelet count and mean platelet
volume in the Callithrix jacchus population studied.

An ELISA was developed for measuring serum antibodies against the arenavirus
lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) and a closely related isolate termed
callitrichid hepatitis virus (CHV). The ELISA was used to test sera from healthy 
adults and from hepatitis patients. In Birmingham, Alabama, the seropositivity
rate for healthy black women was 5.1% (7/138), and the rate for patients with all
types of hepatitis or cirrhosis was 4.3% (2/46). In San Antonio, Texas, the
seropositivity rate among a clinical series of patients with non-A, non-B
hepatitis was 0 (0/20), and the rate among persons rejected from blood donation
because of high serum alanine aminotransferase levels was 2.4% (2/82). These
results indicate that infection with LCMV or CHV is common in Birmingham but that
infection is not associated with hepatitis.

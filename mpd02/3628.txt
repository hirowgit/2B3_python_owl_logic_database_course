Cell death in B cell terminal differentiation rapidly follows cell cycle arrest
in IL-6 differentiation of EBV-immortalized, IgG-bearing human lymphoblastoid
cells in vitro. G1 arrest is now found to coincide with repression of EBNA2 and
LMP1, two EBV genes essential for B cell transformation, without activation of
the viral lytic cycle. IL-6-differentiated B cells die by apoptosis, as evidenced
by increases in Annexin V binding activity, PARP cleavage, and chromatin
disorganization. Expression of Mcl-1, a Bcl-2 family member, was specifically
induced during IL-6 differentiation and down-regulated during apoptosis. Thus,
IL-6 reverses EBV immortalization and activates the terminal differentiation
program in IgG-bearing human B lymphoblastoid cells, including regulation of an
anti-apoptotic gene to coordinate differentiation, cell cycle arrest, and cell
death.

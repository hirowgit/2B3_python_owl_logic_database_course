Population variation in primate vocal structure has been rarely observed. Here,
we report significant population differences in the structure of two
vocalizations in wild pygmy marmosets (Trills and J calls). We studied 14 groups 
of pygmy marmosets Callithrix (Cebuella) pygmaea pygmaea from five populations in
northeastern Ecuador. We analyzed the acoustic structure of Trills and J calls
recorded from two adult animals in each group through focal samples. Although
individuals and groups within a population differed in call structure, we found
consistent structural differences at a population level for Trills and J calls.
Pair-wise comparisons for the two call types point to San Pablo and Amazoonico as
the populations that differed the most, whereas Hormiga and Zancudococha showed
the least differences. Discriminant function analysis indicates that calls from
each population could be classified accurately at rates significantly above
chance. Habitat acoustics, social factors and genetic drift may explain
interpopulation vocal differences. This is the first evidence of
within-subspecies vocal differences, or dialects, in wild populations of a
neotropical primate species.

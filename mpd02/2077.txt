The common marmoset is a small New World Primate that has been used as an
immunological model for a number of human diseases. Dendritic cells (DC) have not
been extensively characterised in this species and in particular protocols to
derive DC from living donors without the need for animal sacrifice are presently 
lacking. This study establishes new protocols to generate substantial numbers of 
marmoset DC for use in cell therapy studies. Recombinant human G-CSF was used to 
mobilise peripheral blood monocytes and CD34(+) stem cells in sufficient numbers 
for large scale in-vitro DC propagation using cytokine conditioning including
IL-4, GM-CSF, FLT3-L, stem cell factor and thrombopoietin. Marmoset DC exhibited 
morphology similar to human DC, were capable of antigen uptake and presentation
and had moderate allo-stimulatory ability. Monocyte-derived DC had a
maturation-resistant immature phenotype, whereas haematopoietic precursor-derived
DC were semi-mature in phenotype and function. This study confirms the
feasibility of the marmoset as a unique small primate model in which to pursue
DC-based immunotherapy strategies.

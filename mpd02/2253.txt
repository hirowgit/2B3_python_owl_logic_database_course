BACKGROUND: The glycan cell surface molecules, stage-specific embryonic antigen
(SSEA)-1, -3 and -4 and tumor-rejection antigen (TRA)-1-60 and -1-81, are
expressed in specific combinations by undifferentiated pluripotent cells, i.e.
embryonic stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells, embryonal carcinoma cells, 
primordial germ cells and embryonic germ cells. Upon differentiation of the
cells, these markers vanish. Recently, it has been shown that also neonatal and
adult mouse testes contain pluripotent cells. Here, we aimed at identifying in
situ possibly pluripotent cells in the adult primate testis.
METHODS: Monoclonal antibodies raised against the glyco-epitopes SSEA-1, -3 and
-4 and TRA-1-60 and -1-81, respectively, were tested to detect cells expressing
the antigens, by immunohistochemistry on Bouin's-fixed and paraffin-embedded
adult primate testes. Man, the new-world monkey, Callithrix jacchus (common
marmoset), and the old-world monkey species, Macaca mulatta (Rhesus macaque) and 
Macaca silenus (Lion-tailed macaque), were included. The percentage of
SSEA-4-positive cells in three adult marmoset testes was determined using flow
cytometry.
RESULTS: Spermatogonia in the testes of C. jacchus were labeled by SSEA-4,
TRA-1-60 and -1-81-antibodies. In the macaques, spermatogonia were detected by
SSEA-4 and TRA-1-81-antibodies. TRA-1-61 did not bind to macaque spermatogonia.
Also, SSEA-1 and -3 did not bind to spermatogonia in any species. In human
testes, we never obtained any clear staining. The total percentage of
SSEA-4-positive cells in marmoset testes was 8.6 +/- 1.61%.
CONCLUSIONS: SSEA-4 and TRA-1-81-antibodies may be very well suited for the
identification and isolation of spermatogonia, and possibly also germline stem
cells, in the non-human primate testis.

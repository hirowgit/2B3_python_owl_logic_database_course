A single injection of ML29 reassortant vaccine for Lassa fever induces low,
transient viremia, and low or moderate levels of ML29 replication in tissues of
common marmosets depending on the dose of the vaccination. The vaccination
elicits specific immune responses and completely protects marmosets against fatal
disease by induction of sterilizing cell-mediated immunity. DNA array analysis of
human peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors exposed to ML29
revealed that gene expression patterns in ML29-exposed PBMC and control,
media-exposed PBMC, clustered together confirming safety profile of the ML29 in
non-human primates. The ML29 reassortant is a promising vaccine candidate for
Lassa fever.

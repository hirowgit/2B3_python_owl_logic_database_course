Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection in tumor cells is generally restricted to the 
latent forms of viral infection. Switching the latent form of viral infection
into the lytic form may induce tumor cell death. High levels of nuclear factor
(NF)-kappaB can inhibit EBV lytic replication, and aspirin has the ability to
inhibit NF-kappaB activity. The aims of the current study were to determine the
effects of aspirin on inducing EBV lytic infection, and thus to reveal the
possibility of targeting EBV-positive cancer cells by aspirin. Our results showed
that aspirin depleted NF-kappaB (p65) in the nucleus and reactivated EBV into
lytic replication. Cells exhibited decreased viability in a dose- and
time-dependent manner when incubated with aspirin. When ganciclovir was used in
combination with aspirin to treat EBV-positive B95.8 cells and Raji cells, the
cytotoxic effect of aspirin was amplified. We demonstrated that aspirin reduced
the viability of EBV-positive B lymphocytes due to its ability to induce EBV
lytic replication.

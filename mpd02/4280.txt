[Expression of HIV-1 tat gene under the control of P 7,5 KD vaccinia virus
promoter in CV-1 cells].

[Article in Russian]

Kholodkov OA, Fodor II.

The transient expression of the HIV-1 gag genes and a HIV-1 ++trans-activator
protein (tat)-encoded was made in cultured CV-1 cells. In recombinant plasmids,
the gag gene was under the control of HIV-1 ++trans-activator sequence (tar) and 
the tat gene was under the control of a 7.5-kd vaccinia promoter. Transactivation
of gag gene expression, which was stimulated by a tat gene expression product,
was observed in the presence of wild vaccinia virus. The transaction was
immunologically evaluated from the binding to monoclonal anti-p17 and anti-p24
antibodies. The findings lead to the discussion whether the regulatory proteins
of HIV-1 can express in vaccinia virus vectors.

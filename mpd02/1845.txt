We have recently reported the discovery of the new benzhydrol template, which has
a highly potent inhibitory activity for squalene synthase, as typified by
compound 1 (SSI IC(50)=0.85 nM). However, it was composed of a pair of easy
rotatable atropisomers. In the effort to fix the isomerization, a highly potent
alkoxy-aminobenzhydrol scaffold was developed. Some of these acquired compounds
demonstrating strong cholesterol synthesis inhibitory activities in a rat hepatic
cell. Moreover, two of the series compounds exhibited specific plasma
lipid-lowering effects in in vivo animal models.

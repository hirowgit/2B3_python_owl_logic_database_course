Burkholderia mallei causes the highly contagious and debilitating zoonosis
glanders, which infects via inhalation or percutaneous inoculation and often
culminates in life-threatening pneumonia and sepsis. In humans, glanders is
difficult to diagnose and requires prolonged antibiotic therapy with low success 
rates. No vaccine exists to protect against B. mallei, and there is concern
regarding its use as a bioweapon. The authors previously identified the protein
BpaB as a potential target for devising therapies due to its role in adherence to
host cells and the formation of biofilms in vitro and its contribution to
pathogenicity in a mouse model of glanders. In the present study, the authors
developed an immunostaining approach to probe tissues of experimentally infected 
animals and demonstrated that BpaB is produced exclusively in vivo by wild-type
B. mallei in target organs from mice and marmosets. They detected the expression 
of BpaB by B. mallei both extracellularly and within macrophages, neutrophils,
and epithelial cells in respiratory tissues (7/10 marmoset; 2/2 mouse). The
authors also noted the intracellular expression of BpaB by B. mallei in
macrophages in the regional lymph nodes of mice (2/2 tissues) and MALT of
marmosets (4/5 tissues). It is interesting that B. mallei bacteria infecting
distal organs did not express BpaB (2/2 mice; 3/3 marmosets), suggesting that the
protein is not necessary for bacterial fitness in these anatomic locations. These
findings underscore the value of BpaB as a target for developing medical
countermeasures and provide insight into its role in pathogenesis.

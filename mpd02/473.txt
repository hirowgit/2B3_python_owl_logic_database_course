α-Synuclein (αS) is the major component of the filamentous inclusions that
constitute the defining characteristic of neurodegenerative synucleinopathies,
including Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and multiple system
atrophy. αS is deposited in a hyperphosphorylated and ubiquitinated form with a
β-sheet-rich fibrillar structure in diseased brains. In 2008, some researchers
reported that embryonic neurons transplanted into Parkinson's disease brains had 
Lewy body-like pathologies, suggesting that pathological αS propagates from
diseased neurons to young neurons. Subsequently, a growing body of evidence
supported the cell-to-cell spread of αS pathologies. Recent studies have revealed
that intracerebral injection of insoluble αS into wild-type mice can induce
prion-like propagation of phosphorylated αS pathology even 1 month after
injection, while injection into αS-knockout mice failed to induce any pathology. 
We also showed that intracerebral injection of insoluble αS into adult common
marmoset brains results in the spreading of abundant αS pathology. These in vivo 
experiments clearly indicate that insoluble αS has prion-like properties and that
it propagates through neural networks. The underlying mechanisms of αS
propagation are still poorly understood, but αS propagation model animals could
be helpful in elucidating the pathogenetic mechanisms and developing drugs for
synucleinopathies.

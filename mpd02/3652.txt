Activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is one of the
hallmarks of the physiological responses to psychosocial stressors. The most
common method of assessing HPA function is via the measurement of plasma cortisol
levels. However, venipuncture involves capture and restraint, which can modify
HPA function. We validated a noninvasive procedure for monitoring HPA responses
to stressors by measuring excretion of free urinary cortisol. Samples collected
throughout the day displayed marked circadian variation, with low cortisol values
in first-void samples, followed by a mid-morning peak in cortisol excretion.
Concentrations of excreted cortisol declined throughout the day. Exposing
marmosets to mild and moderate stressors (11 h isolation in a small cage and
manual restraint) increased excreted cortisol concentrations in a dose-dependent 
fashion: isolation in a small cage led to elevated cortisol in afternoon samples,
while manual restraint and isolation produced elevated cortisol in both morning
and afternoon samples. The marmoset HPA is differentially sensitive to rather
subtle variations in stressors, and these results show that urinary cortisol
excretion is a valid and sensitive index of the HPA response to these stressors.

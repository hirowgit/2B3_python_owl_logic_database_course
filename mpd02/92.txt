For achieving retrograde gene transfer, we have so far developed two types of
lentiviral vectors pseudotyped with fusion envelope glycoprotein, termed HiRet
vector and NeuRet vector, consisting of distinct combinations of rabies virus and
vesicular stomatitis virus glycoproteins. In the present study, we compared the
patterns of retrograde transgene expression for the HiRet vs. NeuRet vectors by
testing the cortical input system. These vectors were injected into the motor
cortex in rats, marmosets, and macaques, and the distributions of retrograde
labels were investigated in the cortex and thalamus. Our histological analysis
revealed that the NeuRet vector generally exhibits a higher efficiency of
retrograde gene transfer than the HiRet vector, though its capacity of retrograde
transgene expression in the macaque brain is unexpectedly low, especially in
terms of the intracortical connections, as compared to the rat and marmoset
brains. It was also demonstrated that the NeuRet but not the HiRet vector
displays sufficiently high neuron specificity and causes no marked
inflammatory/immune responses at the vector injection sites in the primate
(marmoset and macaque) brains. The present results indicate that the retrograde
transgene efficiency of the NeuRet vector varies depending not only on the
species but also on the input projections.

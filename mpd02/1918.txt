Social interactions are a fundamental aspect of human and animal behavior.
Although neuroimaging and other non-invasive methods have progressed recently,
the neurobiology of social behavior requires the use of animal models. Here, we
introduced a multi-behavior parameter integration method and applied it to
female-male interaction of adult common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus). Based on 
the correlated parameters and meeting context, we found that the behavioral
endpoints clustered in four distinct categories, which could be interpreted as
active, freeze, alert, and affinity emotional states. The relevance of this
interpretation was supported as the female behavior category change positively
correlated with serum cortisol and progesterone levels after social interaction. 
Thus, our multi-behavior parameter integration method may be useful to evaluate
social emotionality in animal models, as well as to quantify social behavior in
human psychiatric disorders.

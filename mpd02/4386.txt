The secretion of plasma melatonin exhibits a diurnal variation in the common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus jacchus) (n = 12) with mean values of 125.8 fmol/ml 
during darkness and below assay sensitivity (mean 70.5 fmol/ml) during the light 
period. Both melatonin secretion and the rest activity cycle appeared to be phase
advanced with relation to the light dark cycle which is consistent with an
endogenous circadian period (tau) of less than 24 h in this species.

The spontaneous incidence and distribution of beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide and
argyrophilic deposits were extensively investigated in the common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus). In 12 young marmosets, up to 67 coronal step sections were 
evaluated in the brain. One brain hemisphere was stained by a silver method and
also immunohistochemically with a primary antibody directed against Abeta.
Argyrophilic deposits were observed in 4 (33%) of 12 animals with silver stain,
and Abeta was seen in 4 (33%) of 12 animals with anti-4G8 antibody. The overall
incidence was 6 (50%) of 12 affected animals. These results show that the young
marmoset brain displays Abeta deposits at a low incidence and that
immunohistochemistry is more suitable than silver staining to reveal rare amyloid
plaques. These findings also provide evidence for the early onset of amyloid
deposits in marmoset brain.

Attention is often regarded as a mechanism by which attended objects become
perceptually more salient, akin to increasing their contrast. We demonstrate by
means of human psychophysics that attention is better described as a mechanism
that reduces contextual integration, thereby ensuring that task irrelevant
information is prevented from influencing the processing of task relevant
information. To investigate possible neuronal bases of this phenomenon we studied
the effects of attention on spatial integration in V1 of the macaque monkey. In
line with our psychophysical results, attention directed to parafoveal locations 
reduced spatial integration by reducing the summation area of V1 neurons.
Additionally we measured length tuning in V1 in the presence and absence of
externally applied acetylcholine in V1 of the marmoset monkey. The effects of
acetylcholine application and attention were largely similar. Acetylcholine
reduced spatial integration by reducing the neuron's summation area. These data
demonstrate that attention can alter perceptual and neuronal spatial integration,
and that acetylcholine might contribute to task dependent receptive field
dynamics.

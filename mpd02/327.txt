Campylobacter species are being increasingly isolated and associated with disease
in humans and animals. Here, we describe four draft genome sequences of
Campylobacter species from nonhuman primates. These include Campylobacter
troglodytis, isolated from wild chimpanzees, and two likely new Campylobacter
species isolated from a lemur, common marmoset, and cotton-top tamarin.

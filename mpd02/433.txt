Inflammatory destruction of iron-rich myelin is characteristic of multiple
sclerosis (MS). Although iron is needed for oligodendrocytes to produce myelin
during development, its deposition has also been linked to neurodegeneration and 
inflammation, including in MS. We report perivascular iron deposition in multiple
sclerosis lesions that was mirrored in 72 lesions from 13 marmosets with
experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Iron accumulated mainly inside
microglia/macrophages from 6 weeks after demyelination. Consistently, expression 
of transferrin receptor, the brain's main iron-influx protein, increased as
lesions aged. Iron was uncorrelated with inflammation and postdated initial
demyelination, suggesting that iron is not directly pathogenic. Iron homeostasis 
was at least partially restored in remyelinated, but not persistently
demyelinated, lesions. Taken together, our results suggest that iron accumulation
in the weeks after inflammatory demyelination may contribute to lesion repair
rather than inflammatory demyelination per se.

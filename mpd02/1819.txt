The objective of this study was to define CYP2D enzymes in marmoset (Callithrix
jacchus) liver microsomes, both at the activity level using debrisoquine as the
model substrate and at the protein level using antibodies raised to human CYP2D6.
Marmoset liver microsomes were incubated with [(14)C]debrisoquine, and the
structure of the generated metabolites was determined using liquid
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and NMR. Marmoset liver microsomes were
very effective in hydroxylating debrisoquine at various positions. Although
4-hydroxydebrisoquine was formed, in contrast to rat and human it was only a
minor metabolite. Debrisoquine was more extensively hydroxylated in the 7, 5, 6, 
and 8 positions. In addition to the monohydroxylated metabolites, a dihydroxy
metabolite, namely 6,7-dihydroxydebrisoquine, was identified. Finally,
metabolites that had undergone ring opening were also detected but were not
investigated further. Antibodies to CYP2D6 immunoreacted with protein in marmoset
and human but not rat hepatic microsomes. In conclusion, we demonstrate that
marmoset liver microsomes are effective in hydroxylating debrisoquine at various 
positions and that they contain a protein that is immunorelated to human CYP2D6.

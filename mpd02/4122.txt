Two young male common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) were injected
intracerebrally and intraperitoneally with a crude brain homogenate prepared from
a cow with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). Two other marmosets were
similarly injected with brain homogenate from a sheep with natural scrapie. The
two animals injected with scrapie material developed neurological signs 38 and 42
months after injection and the two animals injected with BSE material developed
neurological signs after 46 and 47 months. Post mortem examination of the brains 
revealed spongiform encephalopathy especially in the basal nuclei and
diencephalon of all the animals and, in addition, involvement of the cerebral
cortex of the marmosets injected with scrapie material. The experiment extends
the host range of experimental BSE to include a primate species.

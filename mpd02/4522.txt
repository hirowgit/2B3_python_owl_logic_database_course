After reviewing the use of non-human primates of the Old and New Worlds for human
malaria research, we concluded that another experimental animal which is easily
available to use and possible to rear indoors is needed. Thus, we studied the
susceptibility of the marmoset Callithrix penicillata to Plasmodium falciparum
erythrocytic infections. The marmosets received various P. falciparum human
isolates, directly from a patient and from continuous cultures. The Palo Alto
strain, which has been adapted to the night monkey Aotus trivirgatus and further 
maintained in the squirrel monkey Saimiri sciureus was also used. In a total of
20 marmosets we performed 31 inoculations, with 10(5) to 10(9) parasites,
intraperitoneally, intracardiacly or intravenously. Blood samples from each
animal were examined daily up to day 90 post-inoculation. None of the intact
marmosets developed patent infections. Four out of 19 C. penicillata, previously 
splenectomized, showed circulating parasites for up to five days after
intravenous inoculation with the Palo Alto strain, becoming negative thereafter. 
Neither the addition to the simian diet of p-aminobenzoic acid, essential for the
parasite metabolism, nor drug-immunosuppression, improved the marmoset
susceptibility to P. falciparum.

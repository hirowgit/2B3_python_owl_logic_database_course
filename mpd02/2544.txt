OBJECTIVE: To determine sildenafil citrate (SC) genotoxicity and cytotoxicity in 
the Callithrix jacchus.
STUDY DESIGN: Fifteen organisms were assigned to one of three groups as follows: 
experimental (25 mg/kg of SC); negative control (glucose solution 5%); and
positive control (3 mg/kg of cytocine arabinoside). Systemic hemodynamic changes 
were monitored in each animal before and after each treatment. A drop of blood
was obtained before and after the treatment at 24-120 h. Smears were made and the
frequency of micronucleated erythrocytes (MNE), micronucleated polychromatic
erythrocytes (MNPCE) and polychromatic erythrocytes (PCE) was counted.
RESULTS: No significant differences in MNE, MNPCE and PCE were found in the group
that received sildenafil and negative control. A significant increase in
genotoxicity and cytotoxicity was observed in the positive control group. No
changes were observed in systemic hemodynamic changes.
CONCLUSION: The macro-dose of SC lacks genotoxic, cytotoxic or systemic
hemodynamic changes effects in this species.

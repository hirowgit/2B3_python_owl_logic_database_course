The platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) family of mitogens exerts vital
functions during embryonal development, e.g. in the central nervous system, where
PDGF drives the proliferation of oligodendrocyte precursors. PDGF and PDGF
receptors are co-expressed in human glioblastoma (GBM). Whether an aberrant
activation of the PDGF receptor pathway is a driving force in glioma development 
has remained an open question. In experimental animals, overexpression of PDGF
has convincingly been shown to induce tumors, both in wild-type animals
(marmoset, rat, mouse) and in mice with targeted deletions of suppressor genes,
e.g. Tp53 or Ink4A. Targeting the PDGF receptor in tumor-bearing mice leads to
growth inhibition and reversion of the transformed phenotype. Findings of PDGF
receptor amplification or mutations in human GBM are strong indicators of a
causative role of the PDGF receptor pathway. However, clinical trials using PDGF 
receptor antagonists have been disappointing. In conclusion, a PDGF receptor
profile may be a biomarker for a subgroup of GBM originating from a PDGF
receptor-responsive cell. Although compelling experimental and clinical evidence 
supports the notion that the PDGF receptor pathway is a driver in GBM, formal
proof is still missing.

Psychophysical data have shown that under mesopic conditions cones and rods can
interact, improving color vision. Since electrophysiological data have suggested 
that rods of dichromatic marmosets appear to be active at higher luminance, we
aimed to investigate the effect of different levels of sunlight on the foraging
abilities of male dichromatic marmosets. Captive marmosets were observed under
three different conditions, with respect to their performance in detecting
colored food items against a green background. Compared to high and low light
intensities, intermediate luminosities significantly increased detection of
orange targets by male dichromats, an indication of rod intrusion.

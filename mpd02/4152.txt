1. The levels of erythrocyte glutathione and the activities of its metabolizing
enzymes--glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), glutathione S-transferase (GST) and
glutathione reductase (GR)--were measured in four species of primates: human,
rhesus monkey, common marmoset and common tree shrew. 2. There were marked
differences in GSH-Px and GST activities among the primates, while GR activity
and glutathione level were much less variable.

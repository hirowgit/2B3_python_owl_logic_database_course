In many birds and mammals, the size and sex composition of litters can have
important downstream effects for individual offspring. Primates are model
organisms for questions of cooperation and conflict, but the factors shaping
interactions among same-age siblings have been less-studied in primates because
most species bear single young. However, callitrichines (marmosets, tamarins, and
lion tamarins) frequently bear litters of two or more, thereby providing the
opportunity to ask whether variation in the size and sex composition of litters
affects development, survival, and reproduction. To investigate these questions, 
we compiled a large dataset of nine species of callitrichines (n = 27,080
individuals; Callithrix geoffroyi, Callithrix jacchus, Cebuella pygmaea, Saguinus
imperator, Saguinus oedipus, Leontopithecus chrysomelas, Leontopithecus
chrysopygus, Leontopithecus rosalia, and Callimico goeldii) from zoo and
laboratory populations spanning 80 years (1938-2018). Through this comparative
approach, we found several lines of evidence that litter size and sex composition
may impact fitness. Singletons have higher survivorship than litter-born peers
and they significantly outperform litter-born individuals on two measures of
reproductive performance. Further, for some species, individuals born in a
mixed-sex litter outperform isosexually-born individuals (i.e., those born in
all-male or all-female litters), suggesting that same-sex competition may limit
reproductive performance. We also document several interesting demographic
trends. All but one species (C. pygmaea) has a male-biased birth sex ratio with
higher survivorship from birth to sexual maturity among females (although this
was significant in only two species). Isosexual litters occurred at the expected 
frequency (with one exception: C. pygmaea), unlike other animals, where isosexual
litters are typically overrepresented. Taken together, our results indicate a
modest negative effect of same-age sibling competition on reproductive output in 
captive callitrichines. This study also serves to illustrate the value of zoo and
laboratory records for biological inquiry.

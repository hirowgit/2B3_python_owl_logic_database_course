The axiomatic theory presented in Galleni and Forti [1999], being part of the
foundational programme of Ennio De Giorgi, is based on the fundamental notions of
quality, relation, operation and collection, and provides a very general
axiomatization of the biological notions of living object, generation, species
and speciation. Within this theoretical framework we consider here a difficult
case of classification of species: the Callithrix jacchus group of the New World 
monkeys. Although the morphological analysis strongly suggests the individuation 
of six different species, nevertheless several experiments of crossing give
evidence to fertility of hybrids. Since both the morphological and the
hybridological criteria have shown to be of enormous importance in actual
classification of species, this apparent contradiction seems very disappointing. 
Our axiomatization of speciation processes as operations acting in special time
intervals permits to avoid the contradiction by allowing for individuals which,
during such special periods, may belong to more than one species. Therefore we
assume that one or more speciation processes are developing, starting from a
unique protospecies and differentiating in six new ones. In order to obtain more 
evidence of these processes, new observations and suitable experiments are
needed.

Neurokinin3 (NK3) receptors and their endogenous ligands (e.g. the neuropeptide
substance P and its C-terminal fragment) have been implicated in psychomotor
activity and reinforcement mechanisms. We review here recent findings on the
involvement of NK3 receptors in the behavioral and neurochemical effects of
cocaine. Although NK3 receptors can modulate dopamine (DA) activity in the brain,
recent results suggest that this modulation does not occur during spontaneous
behavioral activity. However, NK3 receptors play a role in the regulation of
cocaine-induced DA responses in the nucleus accumbens core and shell subregions. 
NK3 receptor agonism as well as antagonism potentiate cocaine's effects on
nucleus accumbens DA subregions specifically, and modulate the acute behavioral
effects of cocaine in rats and non-human primates (Callithrix penicillata).
However, conditioned place preference studies in rats have, so far, failed to
provide evidence for an involvement of NK3 receptors in the reinforcing effects
of cocaine.

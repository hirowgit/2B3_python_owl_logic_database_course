Taste thresholds and consumption responses to above-threshold concentrations of
fructose solutions were determined in eight callitrichid primate species using
the "two-bottle preference test". Although taste thresholds are relatively
similar across species, above-threshold responses may differ considerably between
marmosets and tamarins. As fructose concentration increases, the rate of
consumption increases less for most marmoset species (Cebuella and Callithrix
spp.) than for Goeldi's monkey (Callimico) and tamarins (Saguinus and
Leontopithecus spp.). It is proposed that distinct shapes of the curves
illustrating these responses characterize species in terms of global taste system
adaptations to different diets.

The structure and epididymal maturation of the spermatozoon of the common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).

Moore HD, Hartman TD, Holt WV.

Maturation of the spermatozoon of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) during
epididymal transit was investigated using light and electron microscopy. Except
for the caudal migration of the cytoplasmic droplet there were no apparent
ultrastructural modifications, although interesting morphological features of the
sperm head were observed such as the substructure of the acrosome and a waist at 
the equatorial region. Alteration to the plasmalemma during maturation was
reflected by an increasing capacity of the sperm surface to bind wheat germ
agglutinin (recognising n-acetyl-d-glucosamine) but not ricin communis or
concanavalin agglutinins. This change was concomitant with the development of
sperm fertilising capacity in this species.

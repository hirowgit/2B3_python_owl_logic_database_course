New World monkeys are valuable animal models to study human diseases. To
determine the phenotype of cells involved in immune responses, we used flow
cytometry to screen a large panel of anti-human monoclonal antibodies (mAb) for
cross-reactivity with cells of the common marmoset and the cotton-top tamarin.
Certain antigens (e.g., CD2, CD8, CD20) are well conserved. However, CD10, CD23, 
and CD33 showed a clear discrepancy in their reaction patterns in both species,
indicating that significant differences on the epitope level occurred during
evolution. Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B-cell lines were shown to be a
valuable tool for screening B-cell-specific reagents. In some cases, fluorescein 
isothiocyanate (FITC) and phycoerythrin (PE) modification of mAbs had a negative 
effect on the binding capacity, which stressed the importance of choosing the
right label. Despite the fact that some CD antigens were not detected, adequate
numbers of cross-reactive mAbs were identified to perform extensive studies on
immunological functions in both the common marmoset and the cotton-top tamarin.

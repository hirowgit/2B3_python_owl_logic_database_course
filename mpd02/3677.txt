The human B-lymphoblastoid cell line, designated JHK-3, with pre-B-cell
characteristics, chronically produces two viruses, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and
JHK virus, an apparently novel retrovirus. The JHK-3 cells are much more
productive of extracellular EBV than the high-producer marmoset line B95-8. The
extracellular virus of the JHK-3 EBV strain is relatively fragile, more broadly
dispersed in an ultracentrifuged sucrose gradient than the B95-8 EBV and more
susceptible to disruption by combined treatment with urea and dithiothreitol. By 
restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, the JHK-3 EBV strain resembles
the EBV strain FF-41. The JHK-3 cells also produce an incompletely characterized,
relatively fragile, enveloped, icosahedral RNA virus that contains
Mn(++)-dependent reverse transcriptase. JHK virions measure 85 nm in ultrathin
sections, much smaller than other Retroviridae. The JHK virus exhibits a
distinctive morphogenesis, most nearly resembling C-type retroviruses. The JHK-3 
cell line provides a human cell model for investigating virus/virus interactions 
and their pathogenetic affects on host cells which chronically and simultaneously
produce DNA and RNA viruses.

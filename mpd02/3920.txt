An improved protocol has been developed for physical enrichment of cDNA sequences
by hybridization to genomic DNA. When applied to microdissection recombinants
derived from a translocation breakpoint region associated with inherited mental
illness, a single cycle of the procedure permitted enriched cDNAs to be
visualized directly by agarose gel electrophoresis. Hybridization screening of a 
library of clones derived from the enriched cDNAs, employing the genomic resource
as a probe, led to the identification of six novel gene fragments. This general
approach to the isolation of regionally encoded genes could be applied to any
subchromosomal interval as a first step towards global transcription map
construction.

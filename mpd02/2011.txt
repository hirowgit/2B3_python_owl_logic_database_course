Studying of antiviral effect of condensed triazine derivatives--3-oxo-
triazinobenzothiazine (the preparation No 1), its ribonucleoside (the preparation
No 3) and ribonucleoside of its 3-thio-analogue (the preparation No 2) on
reproduction of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in lymphoblastoid Raji cells is reported
in present work. The cytotoxic action of these preparations on test cells was
determined and CC50 index was 125 microg/ml for the preparation No 1, for
preparation No 2 - 625 microg/ml, and for preparation No 3 - 750 microg/ml.
Antiviral activity of the preparations was tested by inhibition level of
accumulation of viral DNA in the cell culture, and effective concentration (EC50 
index) was determined for each preparation. EC50 constituted 1 microg/ml for each
triazinobenzothiazines. Selectivity index (SI) was 125 for preparation No 1, for 
preparation No 2 - 625, and for preparation No 3 - 750. The obtained results of
studying of triazinobenzothiazines as inhibitors of EBV-infection support their
high antiEBV activity and can be interesting for further investigations.

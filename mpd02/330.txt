BACKGROUND: Increased firing across glutamatergic synapses may contribute to both
the motor dysfunction and L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia seen in Parkinson's disease. 
Given their ability to reduce glutamate release, activation of group III
metabotropic glutamate receptors such as metabotropic glutamate receptor 4 may
prove effective against both motor dysfunction and dyskinesia in Parkinson's
disease.
OBJECTIVE: We hypothesised that activation of metabotropic glutamate receptor 4
by an orthosteric agonist
((2S)-2-amino-4-(hydroxy(hydroxy(4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-5-nitrophenyl)methyl)phospho
ryl)butanoic acid, LSP1-2111) would produce antiparkinsonian activity and reduce 
expression of dyskinesia in a 1-methyl-4-phenyl,1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine
(MPTP)-treated marmoset model of Parkinson's disease.
METHODS: Common marmosets were previously treated with MPTP and pre-primed with
L-DOPA for up to 28 days to express dyskinesia. LSP1-2111 (1, 3, or 6 mg/kg s.c.)
or vehicle (0.9% saline s.c.) were administered immediately prior to L-DOPA
(8 mg/kg + benserazide (10 mg/kg) p.o.) or vehicle (10% sucrose p.o.). Locomotor 
activity was measured in automated test cages and animals were scored for
dyskinesia and disability.
RESULTS: As expected, L-DOPA reversed motor disability and induced moderate
dyskinesia. By contrast, LSP1-2111 alone significantly reduced the motor
disability without any accompanying expression of dyskinesia. When administered
in combination with L-DOPA, LSP1-2111 did not significantly reduce the severity
of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia.
CONCLUSION: Systemic administration of LSP1-2111 reduces motor disability without
causing dyskinesia in MPTP-treated marmosets, supporting a role for metabotropic 
glutamate receptor 4 orthosteric agonists as promising monotherapy for PD.
Conversely, this study found no evidence to support their use as antidyskinetic
agents within the dose range tested.

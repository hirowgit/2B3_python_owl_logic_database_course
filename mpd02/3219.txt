Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is implicated in the development of human B cell
lymphomas and carcinomas. Although related oncogenic herpesviruses were believed 
to be endemic only in Old World primate species, we now find these viruses to be 
endemic in New World primates. We have isolated a transforming, EBV-related virus
from spontaneous B cell lymphomas of common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus).
Sequencing of two-thirds of the genome reveals considerable divergence from the
genomes of EBV and Old World primate EBV-related viruses, including differences
in genes important for virus-induced cell growth transformation and pathogenesis.
DNA related to the C. jacchus herpesvirus is frequently detected in squirrel
monkey peripheral blood lymphocytes, indicating that persistent infection with
EBV-related viruses is prevalent in both New World primate families.
Understanding how these more divergent EBV-related viruses achieve similar
biologic outcomes in their natural host is likely to provide important insights
into EBV infection, B cell growth transformation, and oncogenesis.

Zoonotic pathogens that cause leprosy (Mycobacterium leprae) and tuberculosis
(Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, MTBC) continue to impact modern human
populations. Therefore, methods able to survey mycobacterial infection in
potential animal hosts are necessary for proper evaluation of human exposure
threats. Here we tested for mycobacterial-specific single- and multi-copy loci
using qPCR. In a trial study in which armadillos were artificially infected with 
M. leprae, these techniques were specific and sensitive to pathogen detection,
while more traditional ELISAs were only specific. These assays were then employed
in a case study to detect M. leprae as well as MTBC in wild marmosets. All
marmosets were negative for M. leprae DNA, but 14 were positive for the
mycobacterial rpoB gene assay. Targeted capture and sequencing of rpoB and other 
MTBC genes validated the presence of mycobacterial DNA in these samples and
revealed that qPCR is useful for identifying mycobacterial-infected animal hosts.

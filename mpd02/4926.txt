Histochemical localization of enzyme activity in the kidneys of male marmosets
(Callithrix jacchus and Callithrix penicillata).

The distribution of several hydrolases and oxidoreductases was studied in the
renal parenchyma of adult male marmosets (Callithrix jacchus and Callithrix
penicillata). The oxidative enzymes showed a high reactivity in the proximal and 
distal tubules, whereas the hydrolases reacted strongly in the proximal tubules
but only weakly or not at all in the thick limb of Henle's loop, distal tubules
and collecting ducts. The NAD-dependent enzymes (except alpha-GPDH) showed a
stronger reactivity in the proximal tubules, while the NADP-dependent ones were
more reactive in the thick limb of Henle's loop and distal convoluted tubules.
Two groups of interstitial cells were found in the medulla. A first group inside 
the outer medulla, showing cells rich in acid phosphatase and nonspecific
esterases and a second group, close to the papilla, reactive to a certain number 
of oxidative enzymes. A different reactivity in cells of the distal convoluted
tubules, thick limb of Henle's loops and collecting ducts (dark cells) was seen
in the case of some enzymes like nonspecific esterase, alpha-GPDH and SDH.

Callitrichids use their tongue in various social, ecological, and hygienic
contexts. Using a noninvasive measuring device, we obtained data on the
operational tongue length (OTL) in seven species from the family Callitrichidae. 
OTL (defined as the maximum tongue extension into the device) varied
significantly between species and the width of the device, but did not correlate 
with mandible length; it is smaller in relation to mandible length in
Leontopithecus chrysomelas compared to species from the genera Saguinus and
Callithrix. Current information does not allow concluding which of the various
functions of the tongue is selecting for tongue length.

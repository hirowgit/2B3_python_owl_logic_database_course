Chromosomal studies in three species of Amazonian Callithrix (2n=44) and data in 
the literature show that this group is karyomonotypic. Moreover, it is
characterized by the presence of abundant heterochromatic regions, unlike the
situation in congeneric forms of Callithrix of the Atlantic coast with 2n=46, and
by the presence of a highly repetitive, exclusive DNA component, with a basic
repeat motif of 1528bp. Karyotypic comparisons with other Callitrichids and an
outgroup species showed that Callitrichids are karyologically conserved and
explained several rearrangements that had presumably occurred during their
phyletic radiation. Analyses of karyologic data enabled the construction of two
alternative phylogenetic topologies. The lack of derived homoeologies, common to 
all members of the genus Callithrix grouped at present, and the fact that
Amazonian species were more similar to Cebuella pygmaea (2n=44) than to their
congeneric forms with 2n=46 suggested that species at present included in the
Amazonian Callithrix should be grouped with C. pygmaea.

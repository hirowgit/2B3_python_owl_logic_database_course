The common marmoset is widely used in neuroscience and regenerative medicine
research. However, information concerning common marmoset disorders, particularly
infectious diseases, is scarce. Here, we report a case of a female common
marmoset that died suddenly due to gas gangrene. The animal presented with
gaseous abdominal distention at postmortem, and Clostridium perfringens type A
was isolated from several tissues. Vacuoles, a Gram-positive bacteremia and
intravascular hemolysis were observed microscopically in the muscles, liver and
lungs. On the basis of these findings, we diagnosed nontraumatic gas gangrene
caused by Clostridium perfringens type A in this common marmoset.

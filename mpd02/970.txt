We report a methodology to chronically record in vivo brain activity in the awake
common marmoset. Over a month, stable imaging revealed macroscopic sensory maps
in the somatosensory cortex and their underlying cellular activity with a high
signal-to-noise ratio in the awake but not anesthetized state. This methodology
is applicable to other brain regions, and will be useful for studying cortical
activity and plasticity in marmosets during learning, development, and in
neurological disorders.

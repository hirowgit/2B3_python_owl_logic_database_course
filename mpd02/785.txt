PURPOSE: Extensive follicle loss has been demonstrated in ovarian grafts post
transplantation, reducing their productivity and lifespan. Several mechanisms for
this loss have been proposed, and this study aims to clarify when and how the
massive follicle loss associated with transplantation of ovarian tissue graft
occurs. An understanding of the mechanisms of follicle loss will pinpoint
potential new targets for optimization and improvement of this important
fertility preservation technique.
METHODS: Frozen-thawed marmoset (n = 15), bovine (n = 37), and human (n = 46)
ovarian cortical tissue strips were transplanted subcutaneously into
immunodeficient castrated male mice for 3 or 7 days. Histological (H&E, Masson's 
trichrome) analysis and immunostaining (Ki-67, GDF9, cleaved caspase-3) were
conducted to assess transplantation-associated follicle dynamics, with
untransplanted frozen-thawed tissue serving as a negative control.
RESULTS: Evidence of extensive primordial follicle (PMF) activation and loss was 
observed already 3 days post transplantation in marmoset, bovine, and human
tissue grafts, compared to frozen-thawed untransplanted controls (p < 0.001). No 
significant additional PMF loss was observed 7 days post transplantation.
Recovered grafts of all species showed markedly higher rates of proliferative
activity and progression from dormant to growing follicles (Ki-67 and GDF9
staining) as well as higher growing/primordial (GF/PMF) ratio (p < 0.02) and
higher collagen levels compared with untransplanted controls.
CONCLUSIONS: This multi-species study demonstrates that follicle activation plays
an important role in transplantation-induced follicle loss, and that it occurs
within a very short time frame after grafting. These results underline the need
to prevent this activation at the time of transplantation in order to retain the 
maximal possible follicle reserve and extend graft lifespan.

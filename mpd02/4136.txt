Marmosets with bilateral ablations of either the lateral or ventral surface of
the frontal lobes were found to perseverate on object but not spatial serial
reversal. They also perseverated on reversal of a visuospatial task where
different stimuli required different spatial responses. No differences were found
between the two lesion groups. Since the control animals showed mild
perseveration on spatial but not object serial reversal it is argued that frontal
ablations do not lead to perseveration of a natural tendency but rather that
object and visuospatial perseveration are forms of stimulus-bound behaviour which
do not occur when the animal is performing a spatial task in which stimulus
position is irrelevant. Perseveration was reduced by pretreatment with a
dopamine-blocking drug (haloperidol). It is suggested that information from
temporal lobe mechanisms, involved in long-term memory, and from frontal lobe
mechanisms, which exert shorter acting influences on behaviour, compete within
the basal ganglia to determine stimulus choice. The ascending dopaminergic
pathway may modulate the balance between these competing factors.

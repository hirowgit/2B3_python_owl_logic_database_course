The administration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) to
common marmosets induced persistent motor deficits and decreased concentrations
of dopamine, homovanillic acid, and 3,4-dihydroxy-phenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and
[3H]dopamine uptake in the caudate-putamen. There was an 80% reduction in
tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactive cells in substantia nigra. At 10 days
following the start of MPTP administration, the activity of choline
acetyltransferase in the thalamus and frontal cortex was unchanged compared with 
control animals. Similarly, specific [3H]QNB binding was unaltered. At 4-6 weeks 
following the start of MPTP treatment, choline acetyltransferase activity and
[3H]QNB binding in the frontal cortex and thalamus remained unaffected. There was
no evidence for cell loss in the nucleus basalis of Meynert or alteration in the 
intensity of staining for acetylcholinesterase. MPTP treatment of the common
marmoset produces a nigrostriatal lesion. In contrast, MPTP did not alter
cortical cholinergic function and was not neurotoxic to the cholinergic cells in 
the nucleus basalis of Meynert.

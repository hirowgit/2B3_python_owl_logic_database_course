Few studies have involved an examination of behavioural gender differences among 
callitrichid primates. The present paper presents consistent evidence from
experimental projects, together with less formal observations, that adult females
of both breeding and non-breeding status in species of marmosets (Callithrix) and
tamarins (Saguinus) demonstrate priority of access to preferred and/or restricted
sources of food. Differences in behavioural strategies between males and females 
in this regard are not only functionally plausible, but are consistent with
differences in natural behaviour both in feeding ecology and social organization 
in species of the different genera. Behavioural propensities that relate to the
behavioural strategies of males and females are also considered, together with a 
number of suggestions for future research that arise directly from the
observations reported.

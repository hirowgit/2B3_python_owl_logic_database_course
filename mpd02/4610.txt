The dopamine D2 agonist LY 141865, but not the D1 agonist SKF 38393, reverses
parkinsonism induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) in
the common marmoset.

Nomoto M, Jenner P, Marsden CD.

Marmosets treated with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) (1-4
mg/kg i.p. daily for up to 8 days) develop profound parkinsonian akinesia.
Administration of the D1 agonist SKF 38393 (1-20 mg/kg i.p.) 4-6 weeks later had 
no effect on the motor activity of animals pretreated with MPTP. In contrast, the
administration of the D2 agonist LY 141865 (0.1 or 0.5 mg/kg i.p.) caused a
marked increase in motor activity lasting for up to 2 h. We conclude that
stimulation of D2 dopamine receptors is essential for motor activation of
parkinsonian marmosets and that D1 stimulation alone is not sufficient to
overcome the akinesia induced by MPTP treatment.

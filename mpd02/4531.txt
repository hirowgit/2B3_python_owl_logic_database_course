Failure of the prostaglandin F2 alpha analogue, cloprostenol, to induce
functional luteolysis in the olive baboon (Papio cynocephalus anubis).

Eley RM, Summers PM, Hearn JP.

The prostaglandin F2 alpha analogue, cloprostenol, which is an effective
luteolytic agent in the common marmoset, was administered intramuscularly to
olive baboons to determine if it possessed luteolytic properties in this species.
The results showed that functional luteolysis was not induced when cloprostenol
was administered during the mid- to late luteal phase or during early pregnancy.

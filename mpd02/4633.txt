Plasma aminotransferase measurements in the marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).

Cowie JR, Evans GO.

Plasma aminotransferase values were measured in a large number of samples from
male and female marmosets. There were no differences due to age or sex for either
AST or ALT. Haemolysis affected values for both enzymes, though the effect on ALT
was greater.

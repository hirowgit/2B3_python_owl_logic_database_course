Octapeptide (OP)/FSH-Receptor Binding Inhibitor-8 (FRBI-8), is a synthetic
peptide corresponding to N-terminal sequence of purified fraction of Follicle
Stimulating Hormone Binding-Inhibitor (FSHBI), isolated earlier from human
ovarian follicular-fluid. In order to avoid the repeated drug-administration,
OP-loaded, polymeric polylactide (PLA) nanoparticle formulation (NP-OP), was
developed using multiple-emulsion technique. This yielded an average particle
size of 120 nm with 70% encapsulation-efficiency. In vitro release profile of
NP-OP showed sustained release of OP for 21 days. In vivo anti-fertility studies 
were conducted in marmosets. Results indicated that control animals conceived in 
the same cycle while two of three treated animals failed to conceive in treatment
cycle. The in vivo studies thus corroborate with in vitro release of OP,
demonstrating its anti-fertility activity in 66% of animals.

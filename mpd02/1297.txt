Parental behavior is important for the development of mammalian offspring.
Research on the mechanisms underlying parental behavior, however, has been
largely restricted to rodent models. As a consequence, although research on
parent-infant relationships has been conducted using macaque monkeys for more
than half a century, little is known about the neural mechanisms and brain
regions associated with such behaviors in primates. This article reviews parental
behavior and its endocrinological mechanisms in marmosets and tamarins, both
cooperative breeders in the callitrichid family, and compares these findings with
studies of macaque monkeys. The paper examines the similarities and differences
between marmosets and humans, and suggests the possibility that marmosets can be 
a model for future studies of the neural underpinnings and endocrinology
underlying human parental behavior.

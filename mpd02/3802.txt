The prefrontal cortex is implicated in such human characteristics as volition,
planning, abstract reasoning and affect. Frontal-lobe damage can cause
disinhibition such that the behaviour of a subject is guided by previously
acquired responses that are inappropriate to the current situation. Here we
demonstrate that disinhibition, or a loss of inhibitory control, can be selective
for particular cognitive functions and that different regions of the prefrontal
cortex provide inhibitory control in different aspects of cognitive processing.
Thus, whereas damage to the lateral prefrontal cortex (Brodmann's area 9) in
monkeys causes a loss of inhibitory control in attentional selection, damage to
the orbito-frontal cortex in monkeys causes a loss of inhibitory control in
'affective' processing, thereby impairing the ability to alter behaviour in
response to fluctuations in the emotional significance of stimuli. These findings
not only support the view that the prefrontal cortex has multiple functions, but 
also provide evidence for the distribution of different cognitive functions
within specific regions of prefrontal cortex.

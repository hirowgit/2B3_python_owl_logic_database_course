The present study analyzed 42 organic solvent extracts of scent mark pools from
five dominant female common marmosets by gas chromatography (GC) and combined GC 
and mass spectrometry. We determined whether there were qualitative or
quantitative differences between the chemical composition of scent marks from
individual females. Gas chromatography and mass spectral analysis detected the
same 162 chemicals in 86% (36/42) of scent mark pools from five dominant females.
This near identical chemical composition of scent marks suggested there were few,
if any, qualitative differences between the chemical composition of scent marks
from individual females. Instead, quantitative differences in scent may provide
the key factor distinguishing individual females. Using the relative
concentration of highly volatile chemicals detected by GC in scent marks, linear 
discriminant analysis classified scent mark pools to their correct donor
approximately 91% of the time. Such highly reliable statistical matching of scent
to donor suggested that each individual female common marmoset has a unique ratio
of highly volatile chemicals in their scent marks which may permit individual
identification of females from odors in their scent alone.

Francisella tularensis was identified as the cause of a die-off which occurred
among a colony of semi-free-living common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus). During 
the outbreak 5 out of 62 animals died of tularaemia in a research facility
located in the district of Goettingen, Germany. All animals had been born at the 
facility suggesting an endemic infection. A total of five culture isolates were
recovered and characterized as F. tularensis holarctica, biovar I. These cultures
represent the first isolates obtained in the Federal Republic of Germany for more
than 45 years. The outbreak area shows several geographical and ecological
characteristics known to favour long-term presence of F. tularensis. Persistence 
of the pathogen in the remote region along the former German-German border,
continuous re-introduction from eastern European countries after destruction of
the 'Iron curtain' or introduction through migrating birds are testable
hypotheses which could explain the emergence of tularaemia in this particular
region.

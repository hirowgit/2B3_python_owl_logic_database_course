The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a New World monkey species with a
limited MHC class II repertoire, is highly susceptible to certain bacterial
infections. Genomic analysis of exon 2 sequences documented the existence of only
one DRB region configuration harboring three loci. Two of these loci display
moderate levels of allelic polymorphism, whereas the -DRB*W12 gene appears to be 
monomorphic. This study shows that only the Caja-DRB*W16 and -DRB*W12 loci
produce functional transcripts. The Caja-DRB1*03 locus is occupied by a
pseudogene, given that most of the transcripts, if detected at all, show
imperfections and are present at low levels. Moreover, two hybrid transcripts
were identified that feature the evolutionarily conserved peptide-binding motif
characteristic for the Caja-DRB1*03 gene. Thus, the severely reduced MHC class II
repertoire in common marmosets has been expanded by reactivation of a pseudogene 
segment as a result of exon shuffling.

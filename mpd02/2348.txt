In this paper we describe tolerated mouth-to-mouth food transfers in captive
adult common marmosets, where an animal approached a conspecific that has
recently received a piece of food, opened the other's mouth forcefully, and
picked food pieces out of it. Tolerated mouth-to-mouth food transfers occurred
between animals of both sexes. They were observed when the possessor was
subordinate as well as when it was dominant, and in four dyads they were observed
in both directions. We argue that this behaviour might have a social function and
that the cooperative breeding system of marmosets might have facilitated its
evolution.

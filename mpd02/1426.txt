Depleting mAbs against the pan B cell marker CD20 are remarkably effective in the
treatment of autoimmune-mediated inflammatory disorders, but the underlying
mechanisms are poorly defined. The primary objective of this study was to find a 
mechanistic explanation for the remarkable clinical effect of the anti-CD20 mAbs 
in a representative nonhuman primate autoimmune-mediated inflammatory disorder
model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in common marmosets,
allowing detailed analysis of secondary lymphoid organs (SLO). We observed that
the depletion of CD20(+) B cells creates a less immunostimulatory environment in 
the SLO reflected by reduced expression of MHC class II, CD40, CD83, and
CD80/CD86. APCs isolated from SLO of B cell-depleted EAE monkeys were also less
responsive to mitogenic stimulation. The depleted B cell areas were replenished
by T cells, of which the majority expressed CD127 (IL-7R) and CCR7. Such effects 
were not detected in EAE marmosets treated with mAb against BLyS or APRIL, where 
B cell depletion via withdrawal of essential survival cytokines was not
associated with a marked clinical effect. We propose that at least part of the
efficacy of anti-CD20 mAb therapy is attributable to the sustained CCR7
expression on T cells within SLO, limiting their release into the circulation.

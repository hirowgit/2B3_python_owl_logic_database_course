The pre- and postnatal development of monooxygenases in the liver and adrenal
gland of marmoset monkeys (Callithrix jacchus) was investigated. Cytochrome P450 
was detected in the fetal adrenal gland, but aldrin epoxidase, ethoxycoumarin
O-deethylase, and ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase activities were below detection
limits. Although fetal hepatic cytochrome P450 was not detected, low activities
of aldrin epoxidase and ethoxycoumarin O-deethylase, but no ethoxyresorufin
O-deethylase, could be detected in fetal liver. These enzymes attained adult
marmosets activities when the offspring were approximately 2 months of age.

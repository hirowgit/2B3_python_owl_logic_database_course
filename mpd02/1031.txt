In the past decade, the New World common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) has taken 
a seminal position in neurobiological research, fueled in part by its smooth
cortical sheet, which allows cortical areas to be easily accessed by current
technologies on the dorsal surface of the brain. In this protocol, we describe a 
method for the precision placement of agents (e.g., tracers or neurotoxins) into 
small brain regions of the infant and adult marmoset, using an MRI-guided
approach. This strategy uses a protocol for prolonged anesthesia without the need
for intubation that we have recently developed, alongside appropriate analgesia
and monitoring. The protocol can be readily adapted to be used together with
advanced research techniques, such as two-photon microscopy and optical imaging. 
Including a 5-d postoperative care plan, this protocol takes 7 d to complete. The
protocol requires a team of personnel experienced in marmoset care and handling, 
and small-animal neurosurgery; an assistant for monitoring the animal and
assisting with anesthesia; and an MRI technician.

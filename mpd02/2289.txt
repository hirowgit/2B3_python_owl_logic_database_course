PURPOSE: To assess the use of visual evoked potentials (VEPs) for the in vivo
detection of impaired visual function in a marmoset model of multiple sclerosis. 
The sensitivity of the VEP recordings was determined by comparison with magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) and histopathology.
METHODS: Baseline VEPs were recorded in six healthy marmoset monkeys in response 
to light-flash stimulation. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) was
induced in four of the six monkeys. Clinical scores were assessed daily, and VEPs
were recorded every second week. In vivo MRI and subsequent histopathology of the
brains and optic nerves were performed at the end of the study.
RESULTS: After induction of EAE, all four marmosets exhibited clinical signs
between day 26 and 38 after immunization. VEPs were normal during the induction
phase of the disease, but deteriorated in amplitude with the occurrence of
clinical symptoms in all animals. MRI revealed bilateral optic neuritis and
signal alterations in the optic tracts and occipital subcortical white matter in 
two of the animals. In the remaining two animals, MRI detected signal alterations
in the occipital subcortical white matter. Histopathologic results were
concordant with the MRI findings.
CONCLUSIONS: VEPs are an easily accessible noninvasive tool for measuring visual 
function and diagnosing impairment of the visual pathway in a marmoset EAE model.

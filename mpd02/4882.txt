On the sublingual structures of Tarsius (Prosimiae, Tarsiiformes) and some
platyrrhine monkeys (Platyrrhina, Simiae, Primates) with casual remarks on the
histology of the tongue. In memoriam William Charles Osman Hill.

Hofer HO.

The sublingual structures of Tarsius, Cebuella and Callithrix are studied
microscopically. Tarsius has a well developed but not specialized sublingua. In
the platyrrhine monkeys the sublingua is lacking completely, but the frenal
lamella (plica sublingualis) is very specialized. From this it is concluded that 
the sublingual organ of Callicebus is a topographically modified frenal lamella, 
not a sublingua.

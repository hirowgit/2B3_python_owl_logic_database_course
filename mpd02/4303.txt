Callitrichid hepatitis (CH) is an acute, often fatal viral infection of New World
primates from the family Callitrichidae. The etiologic agent of CH is unknown. We
report here the isolation of an arenavirus from a common marmoset (Callithrix
jacchus) with CH by using in vitro cultures of marmoset hepatocytes and Vero-E6
cells. Enveloped virions 67 to 133 nm in diameter with ribosomelike internal
structures were seen in infected cultures. Immunofluorescence and Western
immunoblot analysis using CH-specific antisera (principally from animals exposed 
to CH during zoo outbreaks) revealed three antigens in cells infected with this
CH-associated virus (CHV). These antigens had the same electrophoretic mobilities
on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels as did the nucleocapsid, GP2, and
GPC proteins of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). Monoclonal antibodies 
specific for these arenavirus proteins also reacted with the three CHV antigens. 
Conversely, the CH-specific antisera reacted with the nucleocapsid, GP2, and GPC 
proteins of LCMV. CHV thus appears to be a close antigenic relative of LCMV. The 
serologic association of CHV with several CH outbreaks implicate it as the
etiologic agent of this disease.

Dermal administration is a nonoral drug delivery system that can keep the
concentration of a drug in the body at a proper level for a long time. This is
suitable especially in patients in the advanced stages of Parkinson's disease
with a wearing-off phenomenon (short duration of effects on antiparkinsonian
drugs), or in postoperative patients who cannot be treated with oral
administration. We studied the effects of lisuride, a dopamine receptor agonist, 
in the dermal application on MPTP-treated common marmosets and on 5 patients with
Parkinson's disease. Lisuride was applied to 4 x 5 cm of skin of the abdomen of
monkeys. In patients with Parkinson's disease, lisuride was applied to the skin
of the chest. The agent reversed akinesia of MPTP-treated animals within 30 min
following the application and relieved the animal of parkinsonism for 5 days at a
dose of 2 mg/kg. In patients, the dermal application of lisuride increased the
duration of the ON period at doses of 1 to 2 mg/kg. These results suggest that
the dermal application of lisuride is a useful treatment in parkinsonism.

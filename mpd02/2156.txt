Since its first description, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis,
originally designated experimental allergic encephalitis (EAE), has been proposed
as animal model to investigate pathogenetic hypotheses and test new treatments in
the field of central nervous system inflammation and demyelination, which has
become, in the last 30 years, the most popular animal model of multiple sclerosis
(MS). This experimental disease can be obtained in all mammals tested so far,
including nonhuman primates, allowing very advanced preclinical studies. Its
appropriate use has led to the development of the most recent treatments approved
for MS, also demonstrating its predictive value when properly handled. Some of
the most exciting experiments validating the use of neural precursor cells (NPCs)
as a potential therapeutic option in CNS inflammation have been performed in this
model. We review here the most relevant immunological features of EAE in the
different animal species and strains, and describe detailed protocols to obtain
the three most common clinical courses of EAE in mice, with the hope to provide
both cultural and practical basis for the use of this fascinating animal model.

Interest in the well being of wild animals in their natural habitats is still
lower than that of domesticated animals and captive wild animals. Urban
development is one of the events that has the greatest impact on fauna, as it
affects the survival and well being of wild species in many ways. This study
aimed to record death by being run over of two Callithrix penicillata
(black-tufted) marmosets in a fragmented environment by urbanization and to
discuss how anthropic intervention modifies species behavior and influences their
well being, and to suggest measures which can reduce the occurrence of incidents,
thereby contributing to maintaining the fauna and their well being.

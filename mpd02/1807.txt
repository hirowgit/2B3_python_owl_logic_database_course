Leptospirosis is an important neglected infectious disease that occurs in urban
environments, as well as in rural regions worldwide. Rodents, the principal
reservoir hosts of pathogenic Leptospira spp., and other infected animals shed
the bacteria in their urine. During occupational or even recreational activities,
humans that come into direct contact with infected animals or with a contaminated
environment, particularly water, are at risk of infection. Prevention of urban
leptospirosis is largely dependent on sanitation measures that are often
difficult to implement, especially in developing countries. Vaccination with
inactivated whole-cell preparations (bacterins) has limited efficacy due to the
wide antigenic variation of the pathogen. Intensive efforts towards developing
improved recombinant vaccines are ongoing. During the last decade, many reports
on the evaluation of recombinant vaccines have been published. Partial success
has been obtained with some surface-exposed protein antigens. The combination of 
protective antigens and new adjuvants or delivery systems may result in the
much-needed effective vaccine.

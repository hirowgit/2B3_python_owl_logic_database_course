Cadherin is a cell adhesion molecule widely expressed in the nervous system.
Previously, we analyzed the expression of nine classic cadherins (Cdh4, Cdh6,
Cdh7, Cdh8, Cdh9, Cdh10, Cdh11, Cdh12, and Cdh20) and T-cadherin (Cdh13) in the
developing postnatal common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) brain, and found
differential expressions between mice and marmosets. In this study, to explore
primate-specific cadherin expression at the embryonic stage, we extensively
analyzed the expression of these cadherins in the developing embryonic marmoset
brain. Each cadherin showed differential spatial and temporal expression and
exhibited temporally complicated expression. Furthermore, the expression of some 
cadherins differed from that in rodent brains, even at the embryonic stage. These
results suggest the possibility that the differential expressions of diverse
cadherins are involved in primate specific cortical development, from the
prenatal to postnatal period.

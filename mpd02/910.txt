The nuclear envelope (NE), a structural element of fundamental importance for the
cell, is the first barrier that meets a virus in the early stages of viral
maturation. Therefore, in order to allow the passage of nucleocapsids, viruses
are known to modulate the architecture of the nuclear membrane to permit a
proficient viral infection. Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), a pathogen from Herpesvirus
family, possesses two well conserved proteins, BFRF1 and BFLF2, which together
form the heterodimeric nuclear egress complex (NEC) that is involved in the early
steps of nuclear egress. Here we show that EBV replication causes the
delocalization of emerin, a cellular LEM-domain protein normally distributed on
the nuclear rim. We also demonstrate that the early lytic protein BFRF1 is
responsible for emerin delocalization. Expression of BFRF1 alone or in
combination with BFLF2 induces emerin hyperphosphorylation. Altogether, these
results suggest a novel mechanism by which EBV exploits the cellular machinery
for nucleocapsid egress.

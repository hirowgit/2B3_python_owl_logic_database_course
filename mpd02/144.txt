Examining interactions among sympatric primate species can provide interesting
information about competition, cooperation, and avoidance between those species. 
Those interactions can be neutral, positive, or negative for the species
involved. Capuchin monkeys are medium-sized primates that can encounter both
larger and smaller primates in their varied habitats. Gracile capuchins (Cebus)
are reported to present different types of interactions with other primates.
Interactions with howler monkeys frequently include physical aggression, while
interactions with spider monkeys are mostly threats and chases. Moreover,
interaction types are not consistent across populations. Among robust capuchins
(Sapajus spp.), however, no reports have been published. Here we describe and
classify encounters of Sapajus libidinosus and S. nigritus with Alouatta caraya, 
A. guariba, Brachyteles arachnoides, and Callithrix jacchus in three sites in the
environments of Cerrado, Caatinga (savannah-like), and Atlantic forest, and
compare the interaction patterns among sites and different group sizes. The
latter is a factor that can influence the outcome, and we expected capuchins in
larger groups to be more aggressive toward other primates. Our results of 8421 h 
of total contact with the capuchin groups show that, indeed, capuchins in sites
with larger groups presented aggressive interactions with higher frequency.
However, the other species' body size also seems important as smaller primates
apparently avoided capuchins, and interactions with the larger muriquis were
mostly neutral for the capuchin. Capuchins showed neutral or aggressive behaviors
toward howler monkeys, with differences between the rainforest and savannah
groups. We found that robust capuchins can present aggressive interactions even
to primates larger than themselves and that aggressive behavior was the most
common response in populations living in larger groups and drier environments.

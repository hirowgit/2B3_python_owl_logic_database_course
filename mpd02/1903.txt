Nonhuman primate (NHP) aging research has traditionally relied mainly on the
rhesus macaque. But the long lifespan, low reproductive rate, and relatively
large body size of macaques and related Old World monkeys make them less than
ideal models for aging research. Manifold advantages would attend the use of
smaller, more rapidly developing, shorter-lived NHP species in aging studies, not
the least of which are lower cost and the ability to do shorter research
projects. Arbitrarily defining "small" primates as those weighing less than 500
g, we assess small, relatively short-lived species among the prosimians and
callitrichids for suitability as models for human aging research. Using the
criteria of availability, knowledge about (and ease of) maintenance, the
possibility of genetic manipulation (a hallmark of 21st century biology), and
similarities to humans in the physiology of age-related changes, we suggest three
species--two prosimians (Microcebus murinus and Galago senegalensis) and one New 
World monkey (Callithrix jacchus)--that deserve scrutiny for development as major
NHP models for aging studies. We discuss one other New World monkey group, Cebus 
spp., that might also be an effective NHP model of aging as these species are
longer-lived for their body size than any primate except humans.

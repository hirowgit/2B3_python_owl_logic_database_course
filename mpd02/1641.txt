Embryo fetal development (EFD) studies in nonhuman primates are frequently
conducted in macaques with Macaca fascicularis (cynomolgus monkey, long-tailed
macaque, crab-eating macaque) being the most accepted model. EFD studies are also
feasible in the marmoset. Due to recent guideline changes (ICH M3(R2) and
S6(R1)), EFD studies are largely confined to conventional pharmaceutical
compounds rather than biopharmaceuticals. This chapter describes basic study
designs and provides working protocols for collecting, processing, and staining
fetuses, including collection of amniotic fluid and umbilical cord blood. The
chapter also covers the examination and terminology for external, visceral, and
skeletal examinations of fetuses. The species covered in this chapter are
cynomolgus monkey (long-tailed macaque) and marmoset monkey.

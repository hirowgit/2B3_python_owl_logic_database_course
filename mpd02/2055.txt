Natural zoonotic infections of two marmosets and one domestic rabbit with herpes 
simplex virus type 1 did not reveal a correlation with a certain gG-, gI- or gE
genotype.

Infections with herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) are not restricted to humans 
but infrequently may be transmitted to certain animal species, in some cases
resulting in severe disease, including encephalitis and death. Recent studies
demonstrate that humanderived HSV-1 field isolates can be typed according to
their gG- gIand gE gene sequences. We investigated whether HSV-1 infections of
animals were predominantly caused by a certain genotype. Isolates derived from
two marmosets and one domestic rabbit, however, revealed different genotypes.
Despite the very limited number of investigated animal-derived HSV-1 strains,
this result does not point towards the existence of certain HSV-1 genotypes with 
a higher potential of being transmitted to animals.

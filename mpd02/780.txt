BACKGROUND: Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) induced by
self-myelin antigen is a widely used in multiple sclerosis (MS) model for
preclinical studies of new therapeutics and potential pathogenesis. By comparison
with rodent EAE models, EAE models in primates are more similar to MS. Some
groups have developed EAE models in primates by using common marmoset (Callithrix
jacchus). However, this model has some limitations. EAE in cynomolgus monkey
(Macaque fasciculrais) could overcome these limitations.
OBJECTIVES: The main objective of this study was to establish an ideal EAE
cynomolgus monkey model resembling human MS by immunizing human myelin
oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) protein.
METHODS: In this study, six female cynomolgus monkeys were divided into two
separate experiment groups and one monkey as the control. EAE was induced in
cynomolgus monkey by immunizing with the recombinant human myelin oligodendrocyte
glycoprotein extracellular domain (1-125) (rhMOG1-125) and a synthetic peptide,
representing peptide 34-56 of human myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein
(MOG34-56) in complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) by subcutaneous multipoint
immunization in the armpit and inguinal region and in combination with
intravenous injection of pertussis toxin, and subsequent booster immunizations
with the same dose of antigen in incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA) until the
animals developed clinically significant EAE (score≥2). The body weight, clinical
scores, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), histopathology, antibody, cytokine
profiling and antigen-specific lymphocyte proliferation were evaluated.
RESULTS: The results showed that despite the different time intervals between
onset and significant neurological deficits, all the cynomolgus monkeys immunized
with rhMOG1-125 or MOG34-56 developed clinically significant acute fulminant or
mild forms of EAE, with a success rate of 100%. The clinical courses were obvious
heterogeneity which closely resembles MS. MOG34-56 immunization was much milder
compared with rhMOG1-125 immunized individuals, at least in cynomolgus monkeys.
Inflammation and demyelinated lesions were present in the brains and spinal
cords. Immune profiling revealed high IgG levels associated with early onset of
EAE but not the course of the disease. Significant antigen-specific T lymphocyte 
responses against immunodominant epitopes of MOG were also detected.
CONCLUSION: Our results indicated rhMOG1-125 and MOG34-56 could induce
successfully EAE models resembling MS in cynomolgus monkeys. The synergistic
action of anti-myelin T cells and Abs during the pathogenesis of EAE could
establish a more ideal EAE model.

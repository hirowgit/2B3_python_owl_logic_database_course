Folds of the cerebral cortex (gyri and sulci) are among the most important
properties of the mammalian brain. Uncovering the physiological roles,
developmental mechanisms and evolution of the cortical folds would greatly
facilitate our understanding of the human brain and its diseases. Although the
anatomical features of the cortical folds have been intensively investigated, our
knowledge about their molecular bases is still limited. To overcome this
limitation, we recently established rapid and efficient genetic manipulation
techniques for the brain of gyrencephalic mammal ferrets (Mustela putorius furo).
Using these techniques, we successfully uncovered the molecular mechanisms of
cortical folding. In this article, I will summarize our recent research on the
molecular mechanisms of development and diseases of cortical folding.

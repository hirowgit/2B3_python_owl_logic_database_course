Primates exhibit complex social and cognitive behavior in the wild. In the
laboratory, however, the expression of their behavior is usually limited. A large
body of literature shows that living in an enriched environment alters dendrites 
and synapses in the brains of adult rodents. To date, no studies have
investigated the influence of living in a complex environment on brain structure 
in adult primates. We assessed dendritic architecture, dendritic spines, and
synaptic proteins in adult marmosets housed in either a standard laboratory cage 
or in one of two differentially complex habitats. A month-long stay in either
complex environment enhanced the length and complexity of the dendritic tree and 
increased dendritic spine density and synaptic protein levels in the hippocampus 
and prefrontal cortex. No differences were detected between the brains of
marmosets living in the two differentially complex environments. Our results show
that the structure of the adult primate brain remains highly sensitive even to
modest levels of experiential complexity. For adult primates, living in standard 
laboratory housing may induce reversible dendritic spine and synapse decreases in
brain regions important for cognition.

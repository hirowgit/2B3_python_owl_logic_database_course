Current therapies for Parkinson's disease (PD) like l-dopa and dopamine (DA)
agonists have declined efficacy after long term use. Therefore, research towards 
supplementary or alternative medication is needed. The implementation in PD can
be expedited by application of compounds already used in the clinic. In this
study the therapeutic effects of the psychoactive compounds
Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta(9)-THC) and modafinil were tested in the
1-methyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-marmoset model for PD. The
anti-parkinson effects of Delta(9)-THC (4 mg/kg) and modafinil (100 mg/kg) in
parkinsonian marmosets were assessed with two behavioral rating scales covering
parkinsonian symptoms and involuntary movements and two test systems assessing
the locomotor activity and hand-eye coordination. Delta(9)-THC improved activity 
and hand-eye coordination, but induced compound-related side-effects. Modafinil
improved activity and observed parkinsonian symptoms but not hand-eye
coordination. It can be concluded that both compounds have therapeutic values and
could supplement existing therapies for PD.

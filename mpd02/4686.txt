Callithrix aurita, an endangered marmoset endemic to eastern Brazil, was observed
from June to October 1982. Preliminary observations suggest that behavioral and
morphological differences exist which distinguish C. aurita from the common
marmoset, C. jacchus. New data are provided on the geographic distribution of C. 
aurita, extending it northward within the known ranges of C. penicillata in the
states of Sao Paulo and Minas Gerais and C. flaviceps in eastern Minas Gerais.

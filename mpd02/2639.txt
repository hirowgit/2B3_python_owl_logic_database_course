BACKGROUND: Recently, several papers have shown that a small subset of retinal
ganglion cells (RGCs), which project to the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and
contain a new photopigment called melanopsin, are the photoreceptors involved in 
light-dark entrainment in rodents. In our primate colony, we found a couple of
common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) that had developed progressive and
spontaneous visual deficiency, most likely because of retinal degeneration of
cones and/or rods. In this study, we evaluated the photoresponsiveness of the
circadian system of these blind marmosets.
METHODS: Two blind and two normal marmosets were kept in cages with a controlled 
light-dark cycle (LD) to study photoentrainment, masking, and phase response to a
dark pulse.
RESULTS: Blind marmosets were entrained with the new LD cycle when light onsets
were delayed and advanced by 6 hours. In constant light conditions, blind
marmosets free-ran with a period of 23.2 hours, while normal animals free-ran
with a period of 23.6 hours. All marmosets responded to dark pulses in the early 
subjective day with phase delays and with phase advances in the late subjective
day.
CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that light can synchronize circadian rhythms 
of blind marmosets and consequently, that this species could be a good primate
model for circadian photoreception studies.

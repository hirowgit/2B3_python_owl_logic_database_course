In this paper, we investigate the role of sociality in changing an induced food
preference in captive common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus), in the particular
case of interactions between animals with contrasting information. After
modifying a food preference by making a preferred food unpalatable for pairs of
individuals (labelled as conditioned individuals) we recorded food choice under
three experimental conditions: pairs interacting (one conditioned pair with one
non-conditioned pair); pairs separated (conditioned and non-conditioned pairs by 
themselves the day after the social condition); control (conditioned and
non-conditioned pairs alone). The main results was that only the conditioned
individuals modified their food choice, consuming significantly more of the
spontaneously preferred food during the pairs interacting and pairs separated
conditions, but not during the control condition.

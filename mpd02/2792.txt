GB virus B (GBV-B) is a flavivirus that is related closely to hepatitis C virus
(HCV) and induces an acute hepatitis when inoculated into several species of New 
World primates. Common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) are a widely available,
non-endangered primate species that is susceptible to GBV-B infection and
develops a characteristic acute hepatitis. Here, animals were found to be
susceptible to serially passaged serum and GBV-B transcripts. Hepatic pathology
and peripheral viraemia could be quantified biochemically, immunophenotypically
and morphologically, and persisted for periods of up to 6 months in some animals.
Hepatitis was characterized by a marked influx of CD3+ CD8+ T lymphocytes and
CD20+ B cells within the first 2 months of primary infection. The results of this
study document the marmoset as another small, non-human primate species in which 
the pathogenesis of GBV-B can be studied and used as a surrogate model of HCV
infection for investigation of pathogenesis and antiviral drug development.

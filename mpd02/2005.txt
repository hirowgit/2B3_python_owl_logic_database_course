Based on the previously reported lead compound, a series of benzofuran
derivatives were prepared to study their antagonistic activities to A(2A)
receptor. The replacement of the phenyl group at the 4-position with a
heterocyclic ring improved the PK profile and aqueous solubility. From these
studies, we discovered a potent new A(2A) antagonist, 12a, which has both a good 
oral bioavailability and in vivo efficacy on motor disability in MPTP-treated
common marmosets.

The B lymphocytes of the common marmoset Callithrix jacchus can be immortalized
by infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in vitro (Desgranges et al., 1976). C.
jacchus is susceptible to infection with the blood stages of several species of
malaria parasite including the line designated MVF1 (Mitchell et al., 1988) from 
which it recovers and shows immunity to reinfection. By exploiting these two
phenomena, EBV-transformed, marmoset lymphoblastoid cell lines secreting
antibodies to malaria parasite antigens have been generated and cloned. We
believe this to be the first time that monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) have been
raised from common marmosets. Since numerous and diverse human pathogens can
infect this small primate in the laboratory, these methods may prove generally
applicable for the generation of MAbs whose specificities derive from immune
responses to infection.

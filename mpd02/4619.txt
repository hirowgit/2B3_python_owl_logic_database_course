We measured the serum concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25-OH-D3) and
1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-[OH]2-D3) in 23 different Platyrrhines from four
different genera and in 21 Catarrhines from six different genera in residence at 
the Los Angeles Zoo. The mean (±S.E.) serum concentration of 1,25-(OH)2-D3 was
significantly greater in Platyrrhines (810 ± 119 pg/ml) than in Catarrhines (61 ±
5 pg/ml), suggesting that high circulating concentrations of the active vitamin D
hormone were a characteristic of New World primates in both the Cebidae and
Callitrichidae family. This increase in the serum concentration of 1,25-(OH)2-D3 
is probably an adaptational response on the part of Platyrrhini to offset a
relative decrease in the concentration of specific receptor for 1,25-(OH)2-D3 in 
target tissues for the hormone.

Four different DNA datasets, representative of all extant neotropical primate
genera, were tandemly aligned, comprising some 6,763 base pairs (bp) with 2,086
variable characters and 674 informative sites. Maximum Parsimony, Maximum
Likelihood and Neighbor-Joining analyses suggested three monophyletic families
(Atelidae, Pitheciidae and Cebidae) that emerged almost at the same time during
primate radiation. Combined molecular data showed congruent branching inside the 
atelid clade, placing Alouatta as the most basal lineage followed by Ateles and a
more derived branch including Brachyteles and Lagothrix as sister groups. In the 
Pitheciidae, Callicebus was the most basal lineage with respect to Pithecia and
to the more derived sister groups (Cacajao and Chiropotes). Conjoint analysis
strongly supported the monophyly of the Cebidae, grouping Aotus, Cebus and
Saimiri with the small callitrichines. Within callitrichines, Cebuella merged
with Callithrix, Callimico appeared as a sister group of Callithrix/Cebuella,
Leontopitecus as a sister group of the previous clade, and Saguinus was the
earliest callitrichine offshoot. Two major points remained to be clarified in
platyrrhine phylogeny: (i) the exact branching pattern of Aotus, Cebus, Saimiri
and the callitrichines, and (ii), which two of these three families (Atelidae,
Pitheciidae and Cebidae) are more closely related to one another.

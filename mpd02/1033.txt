Optogenetics has revolutionized the study of functional neuronal circuitry
(Boyden ES, Zhang F, Bamberg E, Nagel G, Deisseroth K. Nat Neurosci 8: 1263-1268,
2005; Deisseroth K. Nat Methods 8: 26-29, 2011). Although these techniques have
been most successfully implemented in rodent models, they have the potential to
be similarly impactful in studies of nonhuman primate brains. Common marmosets
(Callithrix jacchus) have recently emerged as a candidate primate model for gene 
editing, providing a potentially powerful model for studies of neural circuitry
and disease in primates. The application of viral transduction methods in
marmosets for identifying and manipulating neuronal circuitry is a crucial step
in developing this species for neuroscience research. In the present study we
developed a novel, chronic method to successfully induce rapid photostimulation
in individual cortical neurons transduced by adeno-associated virus to express
channelrhodopsin (ChR2) in awake marmosets. We found that large proportions of
neurons could be effectively photoactivated following viral transduction and that
this procedure could be repeated for several months. These data suggest that
techniques for viral transduction and optical manipulation of neuronal
populations are suitable for marmosets and can be combined with existing
behavioral preparations in the species to elucidate the functional neural
circuitry underlying perceptual and cognitive processes.

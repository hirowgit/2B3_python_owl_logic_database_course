The dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) of Tree Shrews (Tupaia glis; n=2) was examined 
by calbindin (CB) immunohistochemistry for the presence of Purkinje-like cells
(PLCs), detected previously in only four different mammals. We found up to eight 
CB-immunoreactive PLCs in the left and right DCN, and a few axons, likely of PLC 
origin, that appeared to leave the DCN. These findings suggest that PLCs may have
a wider distribution through mammalian species, and may represent more than just 
misrouted cells.

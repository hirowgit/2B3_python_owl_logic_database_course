The common marmoset, Callithrix jacchus, is of growing importance for research in
neuroscience and related fields. In the present work, we describe a combined
histological and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) atlas constructed from the
brains of two adult female marmosets. Histological sections were processed from
Nissl staining and digitized to produce an atlas in a large format that
facilitates visualization of structures with significant detail. Naming of
identifiable brain structures was performed utilizing current terminology. The
histological sections and a simplified schematic atlas are available online at
http://udn.nichd.nih.gov/brainatlas_home.html.

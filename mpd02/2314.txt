Primary cultures of cells tend to have a limited life span, which in turn limits 
the availability of a consistent population of cells to study. In this unit,
Epstein-Barr virus produced by a marmoset cell line is used to transform B cells 
into a continuously growing cell line that produces no virus. These cell lines
can be used as a constant source of cells for further study.

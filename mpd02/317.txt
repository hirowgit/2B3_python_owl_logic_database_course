Common marmosets infected with GB virus-B (GBV-B) chimeras containing hepatitis C
virus (HCV) core and envelope proteins (CE1E2p7) developed more severe hepatitis 
than those infected with HCV envelope proteins (E1E2p7), suggesting that HCV core
protein might be involved in the pathogenesis of viral hepatitis. The potential
role of HCV core in hepatic inflammation was investigated. Six individual cDNA
libraries of liver tissues from HCV CE1E2p7 or E1E2p7 chimera-infected marmosets 
(three animals per group) were constructed and sequenced. By differential
expression gene analysis, 30 of 632 mRNA transcripts were correlated with the
immune system process, which might be associated with hepatitis. A
protein-protein interaction network was constituted by STRING database based on
these 30 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), showing that IL-32 might play a
central regulatory role in HCV core-related hepatitis. To investigate the effect 
of HCV core protein on IL-32 production, HCV core expressing and mock constructs 
were transfected into Huh7 cells. IL-32 mRNA and secretion protein were detected 
at significantly higher levels in cells expressing HCV core protein than in those
without HCV core expression (P < 0.01 and P < 0.001, respectively). By KEGG
enrichment analysis and using the specific signaling pathway inhibitor LY294002
for inhibition of PI3K, IL-32 expression was significantly reduced (P < 0.001).
In conclusion, HCV core protein induces an increase of IL-32 expression via the
PI3K pathway in hepatic cells, which played a major role in development of
HCV-related severe hepatitis.

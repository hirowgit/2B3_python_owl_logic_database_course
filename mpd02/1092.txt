1.窶サhe pharmacokinetic data of cytochrome P450 probes in humans can be
extrapolated from corresponding data in cynomolgus monkeys, dogs and minipigs
using simplified physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling. In this
study, the modeling methodology was further adapted to estimate human plasma
concentrations of P450 probes based on data from mice transplanted with human
hepatocytes or based on data from marmosets. 2.窶ザsing known species allometric
scaling factors, the observed plasma concentrations of caffeine, warfarin,
omeprazole, metoprolol, and midazolam in chimeric TK-NOG mice with humanized
liver were scaled to human oral monitoring equivalents. Using the same approach, 
the previously reported pharmacokinetics of the five P450 probes in marmosets
were also scaled to reported equivalents in humans using in vitro metabolic
clearance data. 3.窶ォuman plasma concentration profiles of the five P450 probes
estimated by simplified human PBPK models based on the observed pharmacokinetics 
in mice with humanized liver and on the reported pharmacokinetics in marmosets
were consistent with previously published pharmacokinetic data in Caucasians.
4.窶サhese results suggest that mice with humanized liver and/or marmosets could be
suitable pharmacokinetic models for humans during research into new drugs,
especially when used in combination with simple PBPK models.

A five-year-old female common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) died after a
one-month clinical course of nonspecific signs. Pathologic findings were acute
diffuse fibrinonecrotizing enteritis and granulomatous endolymphangitis of
intestinal and mesenteric lymphatic vessels. Both lesions were associated with a 
marked proliferation of Mayer's mucicarmine-positive, 4 to 15 microm yeasts that 
were surrounded by a wide clear halo. The infection was probably acquired by oral
route. Other findings included moderate multifocal granulomatous and necrotizing 
hepatitis and mesangial nephropathy. Although the immunological status of this
marmoset was unknown, cryptococcosis might induce primary lethal intestinal
infections in callitrichids.

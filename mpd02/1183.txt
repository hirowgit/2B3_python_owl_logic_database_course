Previous studies have demonstrated that patients with schizophrenia show greater 
sensitivity to psychostimulants than healthy subjects. Sensitization to
psychostimulants and resultant alteration of dopaminergic neurotransmission in
rodents has been suggested as a useful model of schizophrenia. This study sought 
to examine the use of methylphenidate as a psychostimulant to induce dopamine
release and that of [(18)F]fallypride as a radioligand to quantify the release in
a primate model of schizophrenia. Four common marmosets were scanned by positron 
emission tomography twice, before and after methylphenidate challenge, to
evaluate dopamine release. Four other marmosets were sensitized by repeated
methamphetamine (MAP) administration. Then, they were scanned twice, before and
after methylphenidate challenge, to evaluate whether MAP-sensitization induced
greater sensitivity to methylphenidate. We revealed a main effect of the
methylphenidate challenge but not the MAP pretreatment on the striatal binding
potential. These results suggest that methylphenidate-induced striatal dopamine
release in the common marmoset could be evaluated by [(18)F]fallypride.

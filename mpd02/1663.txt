Optimization of oocyte culture conditions is a crucial aspect of reproductive
biology and technology. In the present study, maturation of germinal
vesicle-stage marmoset oocytes were evaluated in the following media: Waymouth
medium, Waymouth medium containing porcine follicular fluid (pFF) (Waymouth-pFF
medium), and porcine oocyte medium (POM). Oocytes cultured in Waymouth-pFF medium
had higher maturation rates to the metaphase II stage than those cultured in
Waymouth medium (36.1% vs. 24.8%, respectively, P < 0.05), indicating the
suitability of this medium for culturing marmoset oocytes. Hence, maturation of
marmoset oocytes cultured in POM was subsequently evaluated. The rate of
maturation to the metaphase I stage was significantly higher and degradation
rates were significantly lower in oocytes cultured in POM than those cultured in 
Waymouth medium. In addition, three offspring were successfully obtained after
transfer of embryos matured in chemically defined medium. Therefore, we concluded
that POM was suitable for marmoset oocyte culture. Furthermore, this was
apparently the first report of marmoset offspring derived from oocytes cultured
in chemically defined medium.

Defects in Fas-mediated apoptosis are implicated in autoimmune diseases including
rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Although induction of Fas-mediated apoptosis could
have therapeutic effects on these diseases, it might cause deleterious effects in
liver as Fas ligand or an agonistic anti-murine Fas antibody Jo2 causes severe
hepatic injury in mice. We report here on the interesting characteristics of the 
newly obtained anti-Fas mAb, HFE7A, which cross-reacts with the Fas molecules of 
various species ranging from human to mouse and mitigates autoimmune symptoms
without hepatotoxicity in mice. The administration of HFE7A to mice induced
apoptosis in the thymocytes, although administration of HFE7A to mice or to
marmosets did not induce any sign of hepatitis. The effect of HFE7A on liver is
different from that of anti-murine Fas antibody Jo2, which causes acute and
lethal hepatic injury to mice. Administration of HFE7A reduced lymphadenopathy
and abnormal T cells in MRL-gld/gld mice. HFE7A induced apoptosis in synovial
cells prepared from RA patients. Surprisingly, HFE7A protected mice from
fulminant hepatitis induced by Jo2. Therefore, HFE7A is a potential therapeutic
antibody not only for autoimmune diseases including RA but also for fulminant
hepatitis.

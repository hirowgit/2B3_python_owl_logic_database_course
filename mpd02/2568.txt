Patterned string tasks are a test of perceptual capacity and the understanding of
means-end connections. Primates can solve complex forms of this task in
laboratories. However, this may not indicate the level of such cognition that is 
commonly employed in the wild, where decision-making time is often short and
distractions such as predator avoidance and competition between conspecifics are 
often prevalent. The current study tests whether wild common marmosets
(Callithrix jacchus) can successfully complete the simplest form of the patterned
string task, parallel strings, while in their natural environment. Although 12
out of 13 marmosets could successfully complete the task, in previous
laboratory-based studies on primates, the errors at this task by all primate
species tested were consistently lower than in the present study. This is
probably explained by the added difficulties imposed by the natural setting of
the task in the present study, exemplified by a significant increase in observed 
vigilance behaviour by subject animals prior to attempts at the task that were
unsuccessful. The undertaking of such tasks by common marmosets in situ probably 
provides a more reasonable representation of the levels of cognitive capacity
expressed by this species in the wild than do laboratory-based studies of the
task.

Developments in microfabrication technology have enabled the production of neural
electrode arrays with hundreds of closely spaced recording sites, and electrodes 
with thousands of sites are under development. These probes in principle allow
the simultaneous recording of very large numbers of neurons. However, use of this
technology requires the development of techniques for decoding the spike times of
the recorded neurons from the raw data captured from the probes. Here we present 
a set of tools to solve this problem, implemented in a suite of practical,
user-friendly, open-source software. We validate these methods on data from the
cortex, hippocampus and thalamus of rat, mouse, macaque and marmoset,
demonstrating error rates as low as 5%.

The aim of this study was to establish a feasible and robust magnetic resonance
imaging protocol for the quantitative assessment of cardiac function in marmosets
and to present normal values of cardiac function across different ages from young
adult, middle-aged, to very old clinically healthy animals. Cardiac MRI of 33
anesthetized marmosets at the age of 2-15 years was performed at 9.4 T using
IntraGate-FLASH that operates without any ECG-triggering and breath holding.
Normalized to post-mortem heart weight, the left ventricular end-diastolic volume
(LV-EDV) was significantly reduced in older marmosets. The LV end-systolic volume
(LV-ESV) and the LV stroke volume (LV-SV) showed a similar trend while the LV
ejection fraction (LV-EF) and wall thickening remained unchanged. Similar
observations were made for the right ventricle. Moreover, the total ventricular
myocardial volume was lower in older monkeys while no significant difference in
heart weight was found. In conclusion, IntraGate-FLASH allowed for quantification
of left ventricular cardiac function but seems to underestimate the volumes of
the right ventricle. Although less strong and without significant sex
differences, the observed age related changes were similar to previously reported
findings in humans supporting marmosets as a model system for age related
cardiovascular human diseases.

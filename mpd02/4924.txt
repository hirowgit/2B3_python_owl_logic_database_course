Diagnosis of pregnancy in marmosets (Callithrix jacchus).

Mitchell SJ, Jones SM.

3 techniques for studying reproductive function in the marmoset are described.
Abdominal palpation was found to be the most successful method for diagnosis of
pregnancy. Vaginal cytology and urinary immunoassays met with limited success and
were of supportive value only.

Feature extraction and unsupervised classification of neural population reward
signals for reinforcement based BMI.

Prins NW, Geng S, Pohlmeyer EA, Mahmoudi B, Sanchez JC.

New reinforcement based paradigms for building adaptive decoders for
Brain-Machine Interfaces involve using feedback directly from the brain. In this 
work, we investigated neuromodulation in the Nucleus Accumbens (reward center)
during a multi-target reaching task and investigated how to extract a reinforcing
or non-reinforcing signal that could be used to adapt a BMI decoder. One of the
challenges in brain-driven adaptation is how to translate biological
neuromodulation into a single binary signal from the distributed representation
of the neural population, which may encode many aspects of reward. To extract
these signals, feature analysis and clustering were used to identify timing and
coding properties of a user's neuromodulation related to reward perception.
First, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of reward related neural signals was
used to extract variance in the firing and the optimum time correlation between
the neural signal and the reward phase of the task. Next, k-means clustering was 
used to separate data into two classes.

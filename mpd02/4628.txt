Effects of ibotenic acid lesions of the basal forebrain on serial reversal
learning in marmosets.

Ridley RM, Baker HF, Drewett B, Johnson JA.

Five common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) received unilateral ibotenic acid
lesions of the basal forebrain. Seven days post-operatively, choline
acetyltransferase activity was reduced by 60% in frontal cortex and 40% in
temporal cortex in the ipsilateral side compared with the contralateral side.
Four animals receiving bilateral lesions of the same area were impaired on the
first post-operative task of serial reversal learning when compared with four
animals receiving bilateral saline injections. Although their performance
improved with time, the lesioned animals were subequently impaired following
administration of a low dose of scopolamine which did not affect the control
group. These results show that lesions within the basal forebrain can affect
cholinergic function in the cortex and impair learning ability.

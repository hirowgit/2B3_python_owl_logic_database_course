Periostin (POSTN or osteoblast specific factor) is an extracellular matrix
protein originally identified as a protein highly expressed in osteoblasts.
Recently, periostin has been reported to function in axon regeneration and
neuroprotection. In the present study, we focused on periostin function in
cortical evolution. We performed a comparative gene expression analysis of
periostin between rodents (mice) and primates (marmosets and macaques). Periostin
was expressed at higher levels in the primate cerebral cortex compared to the
mouse cerebral cortex. Furthermore, we performed overexpression experiments of
periostin in vivo and in vitro. Periostin exhibited neurite outgrowth activity in
cortical neurons. These results suggested the possibility that prolonged and
increased periostin expression in the primate cerebral cortex enhances the
cortical plasticity of the mammalian cerebral cortex.

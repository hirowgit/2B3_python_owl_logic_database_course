The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is an increasingly popular non-human
primate species for developing transgenic and genomic edited models of
neurological disorders. These models present an opportunity to assess from birth 
the impact of genetic mutations and to identify candidate predictive biomarkers
of early disease onset. In order to apply findings from marmosets to humans, a
cross-species comparison of typical development is essential. Aiming to identify 
similarities, differences, and gaps in knowledge of neurodevelopment, we
evaluated peer-reviewed literature focused on the first 6 months of life of
marmosets and compared to humans. Five major developmental constructs, including 
reflexes and reactions, motor, feeding, self-help, and social, were compared.
Numerous similarities were identified in the developmental sequences with
differences often influenced by the purpose of the behavior, specifically for
marmoset survival. The lack of detailed knowledge of marmoset development was
exposed as related to the vast resources for humans.

The biological underpinnings of human intelligence remain enigmatic. There
remains the greatest confusion and controversy regarding mechanisms that enable
humans to conceptualize, plan, and prioritize, and why they are set apart from
other animals in their cognitive abilities. Here we demonstrate that the basic
neuronal building block of the cerebral cortex, the pyramidal cell, is
characterized by marked differences in structure among primate species. Moreover,
comparison of the complexity of neuron structure with the size of the cortical
area/region in which the cells are located revealed that trends in the granular
prefrontal cortex (gPFC) were dramatically different to those in visual cortex.
More specifically, pyramidal cells in the gPFC of humans had a disproportionately
high number of spines. As neuron structure determines both its biophysical
properties and connectivity, differences in the complexity in dendritic structure
observed here endow neurons with different computational abilities. Furthermore, 
cortical circuits composed of neurons with distinguishable morphologies will
likely be characterized by different functional capabilities. We propose that 1. 
circuitry in V1, V2, and gPFC within any given species differs in its functional 
capabilities and 2. there are dramatic differences in the functional capabilities
of gPFC circuitry in different species, which are central to the different
cognitive styles of primates. In particular, the highly branched, spinous neurons
in the human gPFC may be a key component of human intelligence.

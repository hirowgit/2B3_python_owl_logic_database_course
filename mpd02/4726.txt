Plasma testosterone response to hCG stimulation in the male marmoset monkey
(Callithrix jacchus jacchus).

Kholkute SD, Aitken RJ, Lunn SF.

In adult animals the intramuscular injection of hCG was followed by a rapid rise 
in plasma testosterone levels within 2-3 h and at doses of 40 and 80 i.u. hCG
this primary response was followed by a second peak of testosterone at 48 h.
Prepubertal marmosets also responded to hCG stimulation with a rapid increase in 
plasma testosterone levels within 3 h, but the magnitude of this peak was lower
than that observed in adult animals and no biphasic pattern was observed. In
adult and prepubertal animals a second dose of hCG (40 i.u.) administered 24 h
after the initial injection failed to produce a further rapid increment in plasma
testosterone levels.

A novel method of assessing muscle function in the common marmoset was developed 
as part of a multidisciplinary long-term study. The method involved home cage
presentation of a weight-pulling task. Over a 4-5 month period, 38 of 42 animals 
were successfully trained to displace weights of up to 920 g (mean 612+/-20 g).
Performance, following initial training, was stable and independent of gender or 
body weight.

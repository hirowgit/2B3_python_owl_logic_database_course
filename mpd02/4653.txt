1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-induced parkinsonism in the common
marmoset.

Jenner P, Rupniak NM, Rose S, Kelly E, Kilpatrick G, Lees A, Marsden CD.

The administration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) (1-4
mg/kg i.p.) for 4 days induced dose-dependent parkinsonism in the common marmoset
within 48 h. MPTP produced profound akinesia, rigidity of the trunk and limbs,
postural abnormalities, loss of vocalization and, in some cases, postural tremor.
In a single animal the administration of L-DOPA in conjunction with a peripheral 
decarboxylase inhibitor, reversed the parkinsonian symptoms. Subsequent
biochemical analysis showed a profound loss of dopamine and [3H]dopamine uptake
in the caudate-putamen, but no change in specific [3H]spiperone binding.

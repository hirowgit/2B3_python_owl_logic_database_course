Vocal development is the adaptive coordination of the vocal apparatus, muscles,
the nervous system, and social interaction. Here, we use a quantitative framework
based on optimal control theory and Waddington's landscape metaphor to provide an
integrated view of this process. With a biomechanical model of the marmoset
monkey vocal apparatus and behavioral developmental data, we show that only the
combination of the developing vocal tract, vocal apparatus muscles and nervous
system can fully account for the patterns of vocal development. Together, these
elements influence the shape of the monkeys' vocal developmental landscape,
tilting, rotating or shifting it in different ways. We can thus use this
framework to make quantitative predictions regarding how interfering factors or
experimental perturbations can change the landscape within a species, or to
explain comparative differences in vocal development across species.

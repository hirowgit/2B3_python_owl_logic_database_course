Non-human primate models of human disease have an important role in the
translation of a new scientific finding in lower species into an effective
treatment. In this study, we tested a new therapeutic antibody against the IL-7
receptor Î± chain (CD127), which in a C57BL/6 mouse model of experimental
autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) ameliorates disease, demonstrating an
important pathogenic function of IL-7. We observed that while the treatment was
effective in 100 % of the mice, it was only partially effective in the EAE model 
in common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus), a small-bodied Neotropical primate. EAE
was induced in seven female marmoset twins and treatment with the anti-CD127 mAb 
or PBS as control was started 21 days after immunization followed by weekly
intravenous administration. The anti-CD127 mAb caused functional blockade of IL-7
signaling through its receptor as shown by reduced phosphorylation of STAT5 in
lymphocytes upon stimulation with IL-7. Group-wise analysis showed no significant
effects on the clinical course and neuropathology. However, paired twin analysis 
revealed a delayed disease onset in three twins, which were high responders to
the immunization. In addition, we observed markedly opposite effects of the
antibody on pathological changes in the spinal cord in high versus low responder 
twins. In conclusion, promising clinical effect of CD127 blockade observed in a
standard inbred/SPF mouse EAE model could only be partially replicated in an
outbred/non-SPF non-human primate EAE model. Only in high responders to the
immunization we found a positive response to the treatment. The mechanism
underpinning this dichotomous response will be discussed.

A low molecular weight peptide has been partially purified from sheep follicular 
fluid. It inhibited FSH binding to granulosa cells from ovarian follicles of
common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus). When injected into cycling marmosets
during the follicular phase, it reduced the area under the curve (AUC) of
circulating progesterone. The peptide also shortened the luteal phase in all
marmosets during the treatment cycle compared to the pretreatment control cycle. 
These results indicate that the ovarian follicular fluid peptide inhibited FSH
binding to granulosa cells thereby probably resulting in decreased progesterone
secretion (AUC) from these cells and subsequently inducing luteal insufficiency.

Gastrointestinal disease is a frequently encountered problem among captive common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) colonies. Management can be challenging due to the 
number of etiologies responsible for gastrointestinal disease in this species,
limitations on diagnostic capabilities, and lack of effective treatments.
Understanding commonly described GI diseases in the captive marmoset can provide 
insight on the impact these diseases have on research studies and aid in the
development of appropriate management strategies. A review of commonly
encountered GI disease processes as well as routinely implicated causes of GI
disease in the common marmoset are provided. Current strategies in clinical
management of GI disease in the common marmoset, including approaches to colony
health, diagnostic testing, and commonly employed treatments are discussed.

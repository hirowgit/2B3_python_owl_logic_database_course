The beta-adrenoceptor subtypes involved in the control of lipolysis in white fat 
cells of rat, dog, marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), baboon (Papio papio), macaque
(Macaca fascicularis), and human were compared. In all species [3H]CGP-12177
binding (up to 3 nM) indicated the existence of a homogeneous population of
binding sites in fat cell membranes, and competition studies showed that beta 1- 
and beta 2-adrenoceptors were present. Selective beta 1 or beta 2-adrenoceptor
agonists induced lipolysis. The efficiencies of isoproterenol and norepinephrine 
were similar. The use of selective beta 3-adrenoceptor agonists revealed that
BRL-37344 and CL-316243 were full agonists, whereas CGP-12177 and SR-58611A were 
partial agonists in rat and dog white fat cells. beta 3-Agonists partially
stimulated lipolysis in the marmoset, while CGP-12177 was weakly active in the
baboon. In macaque and human fat cells, beta 3-agonists were ineffective. The
lipolytic effect of norepinephrine involves beta 1-and/or beta 2-adrenoceptors in
baboon, macaque, and human. The baboon and macaque constitute valuable models for
studying the beta-adrenergic control of lipolysis.

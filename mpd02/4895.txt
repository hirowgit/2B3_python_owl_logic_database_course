The effect of dexamethasone in traumatic changes of the periodontium of marmosets
(Callithrix jacchus).

Sallum AW, Nascimento A, Bozzo L, Toledo S.

The systemic administration of steroid hormone (0.400 mg of Dexamethasone every 2
days), during a 28-day period in marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) produced
modifications in the evolution of the experimental periodontal traumatism. The
observed changes were osteoporosis and reduction of the periodontal fibers in
quantity as well as a reduction of repair process, when compared to the control
group that only received the action of the trauma from occlusion.

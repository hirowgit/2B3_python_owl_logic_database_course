A noninvasive method of saliva sampling was used to assess the diurnal cortisol
rhythm from 0900 to 1700 hr in the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). The
levels of cortisol were highest in the morning and declined significantly over
the day. Individual marmosets varied in the magnitude of the cycle, and the
greatest individual variability occurred in the morning levels. The decrease in
cortisol levels was more rapid after than before the midday feeding period in
subordinate marmosets (aged 53-63 months) compared to dominant marmosets (aged
79-80 months), and overall, the levels of cortisol were higher in the subordinate
marmosets. We found no effect of sex on cortisol levels across the cycle.

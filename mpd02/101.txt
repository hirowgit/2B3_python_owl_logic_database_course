BACKGROUND: Food avoidance secondary to disease or stress can lead to weight loss
and rapid deterioration of clinical condition in the common marmoset (Callithrix 
jacchus). Currently, there are no data supporting the use of any pharmaceuticals 
as an appetite stimulant in this species; however, benzodiazepines are frequently
used for this purpose in other species.
METHODS: Six marmosets were used in a crossover study design to evaluate the
benzodiazepine midazolam as an appetite stimulant and anxiolytic. Total food
intake (TFI) and latency to eat (LTE) were measured following administration of
oral and injectable midazolam in non-anxious and anxious states.
RESULTS: Injectable midazolam increased TFI and decreased LTE in anxious
marmosets, but had no effect in non-anxious animals. Oral midazolam had no effect
on appetite in either state.
CONCLUSIONS: Injectable midazolam may be an effective treatment for
anxiety-induced inappetence in marmosets. Individual response to both oral and
injectable midazolam may vary.

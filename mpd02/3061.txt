The behavioral effects of the amino (N)-terminal fragment of substance P
(SP(1-7)) on the marmoset (Callithrix penicillata) predator confrontation test of
fear/anxiety were investigated. The test apparatus consisted of a figure-eight
maze with three parallel arms interconnected at each extremity to a perpendicular
arm. A taxidermized oncilla cat (Felis tigrina) was placed outside the maze
facing one of its corners. Subjects were submitted to seven 30 min maze
habituation trials (HTs), in the absence of the 'predator', and then to six 30
min treatment trials (TTs), in the presence of the 'predator', consisting of four
doses of SP(1-7) (5, 50, 250 and 500 microg/kg; IP), saline and sham injection.
SP(1-7) treatment reversed, in a dose-dependent way, the fear-induced avoidance
behavior due to the predator's presence and increased the frequency of
exploratory behaviors. Locomotor activity decreased during successive HTs, yet
increased after all SP(1-7) treatments. These results indicate that systemic
administration of SP(1-7) produces anxiolytic-like effects in marmosets tested in
the predator confrontation model of fear/anxiety.

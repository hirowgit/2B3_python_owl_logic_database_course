Microspectrophotometric measurements of visual pigments and behavioural
measurements of spectral sensitivity are reported for individual marmosets from 3
family groups. The sex differences and polymorphism that characterise the
long-wave cone pigments in this species are well reflected by variations in the
behavioural sensitivities. With one exception, the pattern of inheritance is
compatible with a genetic model in which the long-wave pigment is specified by a 
single polymorphic locus on the X-chromosome. Measurements are also reported for 
the spectral absorbance of the marmoset lens, and these are used to reconstruct
short-wave behavioural sensitivity from the microspectrophotometric measurements 
of the short-wave cones.

A pilot study on the effect of alteration of the suprahyoid muscles on the growth
of the marmoset monkey.

Davis WH, Sailer H, Poswillo D.

A pilot study was undertaken to determine the effect, if any, of alteration of
the suprahyoid muscles on mandibular growth in the marmoset. It was postulated
that releasing the attachment of the digastric and geniohyoid muscles at their
junction with the mandible might produce a growth change in the rotation pattern 
of mandibular growth. Similarly, shortening these muscles might produce a
different but significant growth change. Ten animals were used, five of which
were controls. Two animals had their suprahyoid muscles sectioned, and three
others had their suprahyoid muscles shortened by plication. The animals were
examined with cephalometric radiographs at the commencement of the experiment and
at specific intervals thereafter until they reached maturity (approximately 1 1/2
years of age). The results indicate that releasing the digastrics and the
suprahyoids at the mandible causes no significant change in the length of the
mandible. Shortening of the suprahyoids through plication, however, appears to
result in a notable change in the mandible and possibly the face. This study
suggests that further research in this area may be fruitful in producing a
primate model with a' retruded genial area or a tongue protrusion by plication or
otherwise shortening the suprahyoid muscles.

A gradient coil with integrated second and third order shims has been designed
and constructed for use inside an actively shielded 310 mm horizontal bore 9.4 T 
small animal MRI. An extension of the boundary element method, to minimise the
power deposited in conducting surfaces, was used to design the gradients, and a
boundary element method with a constraint on mutual inductance was used to design
the shims. The gradient coil allows for improved imaging performance and was
optimized for an imaging region appropriate for marmoset imaging studies.
Efficiencies of 1.5 mT m-1 A-1 were achieved in a 15 cm wide bore while
maintaining gradient uniformity â‰¤5% over the 8 cm region of interest. Two new
cooling methods were implemented which allowed the gradient coil to operate at
100 A RMS, 25 % of max current with a temperature rise below 30 C.

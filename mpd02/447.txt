We proposed a generic template-derived approach for (semi-) automated brain
extraction in animal MRI studies and evaluated our implementation with different 
animal models (macaque, marmoset, rodent) and MRI protocols (T1, T2). While
conventional MR-neuroimaging studies perform brain extraction as an initial step 
priming subsequent image-registration from subject to template, our proposed
approach propagates an anatomical template to (whole-head) individual subjects in
reverse order, which is challenging due to the surrounding extracranial tissue,
greater differences in contrast pattern and larger areas with field
inhomogeneity. As a novel approach, the herein introduced brain extraction
algorithm derives whole-brain segmentation using rigid and non-rigid deformation 
based on unbiased anatomical atlas building with a priori estimates from
study-cohort and an initial approximate brain extraction. We evaluated our
proposed method in comparison to several other technical approaches including
"Marker based watershed scalper", "Brain-Extraction-Tool", "3dSkullStrip",
"Primatologist-Toolbox", "Rapid Automatic Tissue Segmentation" and "Robust
automatic rodent brain extraction using 3D pulse-coupled neural networks" with
manual skull-stripping as reference standard. ABX demonstrated best performance
with accurate (≥92%) and consistent results throughout datasets and across
species, age and MRI protocols. ABX was made available to the public with
documentation, templates and sample material (

The leading-limb preferences of 17 common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) when
they initiated and terminated locomotion were determined from video recordings of
the subjects walking on, leaping off, and landing on a plexiglas platform. In a
majority of sequences, 11 of 17 subjects landed with the right hand and foot
contacting the plexiglas substrate before the left hand and foot. Of the 17
subjects, 8 initiated leaping with the right side of the body, whereas only 3
subjects significantly preferred to initiate leaping with the left hand and foot.
Leading-limb preferences displayed during landing were positively correlated with
those displayed for leaping and walking, although only two subjects displayed
significant leading-limb preferences when walking. By contrast, hand preferences 
for initiating and terminating locomotion were not related to hand preferences
for food holding; 16 of 17 marmosets displayed strong and significant hand
preferences for food holding, even though many did not show leading-limb
preferences for walking, leaping, or landing. These data seem to suggest that the
right arm is stronger in marmosets. The right arm is used initially to decelerate
the body and absorb the impact of contact with the landing substrate. The
tendency for the right arm to be stronger is balanced by a tendency for the left 
leg to be stronger (providing the force needed for leaping).

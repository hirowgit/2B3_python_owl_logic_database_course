The retino-geniculo-cortical pathway in Callithrix. II. The geniculo-cortical
projection.

Spatz WB.

After monocular injections of tritiated tracer precursors and transneuronal
transport of tritiated compounds, a continuous band of radioactivity in layer IV 
of striate cortex of Callithrf the crossed and uncrossed retino-cortical
pathways. Comparison with the organization of these pathways in other primates
suggests that a segregation of the retino-cortical pathways of opposite
ocularities into alternating ocular dominance columns in striate cortex has
developed independently in the different primate lines. The significance is
discussed of the weak labeling of the region of area 17 representing the central 
retina as compared to the representation of the peripheral retina.

The karyotypes of the species belonging to the group Callithrix argentata
(Callitrichidae, Platyrrhini) are characterized by large amounts of distal
constitutive heterocharomatin (CH). The CH of the species C. argentata, C.
humeralifera and C. emiliae was analyzed by banding with the restriction enzymes 
HinfI, MboI, aluI, RsaI, DdeI, HaeIII and MspI, as well as the fluorochromes CMA3
and DAPI. The results obtained permitted us to classify the CH of these species
into three distinct types: 1) distal CH with a homogeneous response to enzymatic 
action, which was unchanged (HinfI, MboI, AluI, HaeIII), partially digested
(DdeI) or fully digested (RsaI), being CMA3+, DAPI-; 2) centromeric CH, generally
presenting a reduced band size. The varying extent of reduction, ranging from
none to total, and also the variation of fluorochrome staining indicates that
there is heterogeneity in this type of CH; 3) CH of the distal portion of the X
chromosome of C. argentata and of the Y chromosome was CMA3- and unchanged by the
enzymes, except for RsaI, which caused a reduction in size. MspI was the only
enzyme unable to induce bands. Sequential C-banding permitted us to perceive
banding variations that could not be observed simply by RE banding.

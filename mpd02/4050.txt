A strain of Bacteroides fragilis, isolated from the marmoset Callithrix
penicillata, produced protein(s) with bacteriocin activity (fragicilin). Two
active fractions (36 and 150 kDa) were isolated by chromatography. The
bacteriocin exhibited iso- and heteroantagonism. It remained stable between pH 3 
and 10 and at 60 degrees C for 24 h. Pronase, trypsin, proteinase K and type VII 
protease inactivated the bacteriocin, giving evidence of its protein nature.

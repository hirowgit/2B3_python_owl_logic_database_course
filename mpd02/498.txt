The genetic and biological similarity between non-human primates and humans has
ensured the continued use of primates in biomedical research where other species 
cannot be used. Health-monitoring programmes for non-human primates provide an
approach to monitor and control both endemic and incoming agents that may cause
zoonotic and anthroponotic disease or interfere with research outcomes. In 1999
FELASA recommendations were published which aimed to provide a harmonized
approach to health monitoring programmes for non-human primates. Scientific and
technological progress, understanding of non-human primates and evolving
microbiology has necessitated a review and replacement of the current
recommendations. These new recommendations are aimed at users and breeders of the
commonly used non-human primates; Macaca mulatta (Rhesus macaque) and Macaca
fascicularis (Cynomolgus macaque). In addition, other species including
Callithrix jacchus (Common marmoset) Saimiri sciureus (Squirrel monkey) and
others are included. The important and challenging aspects of non-human primate
health-monitoring programmes are discussed, including management protocols to
maintain and improve health status, health screening strategies and procedures,
health reporting and certification. In addition, information is provided on
specific micro-organisms and the recommended frequency of testing.

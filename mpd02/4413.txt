The effect of bicuculline-induced status epilepticus (SE) on local cerebral
metabolic rates for glucose (LCMRglc) was studied in 2-wk-old
ketamine-anesthetized marmoset monkeys, using the 2-[14C]-deoxy-D-glucose
autoradiographical technique. To estimate LCMRglc in cerebral cortex and thalamus
during SE, the lumped constant (LC) for 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) and the rate
constants for 2-DG and glucose were calculated for these regions. The control LC 
was 0.43 in frontoparietal cortex, 0.51 in temporal cortex, and 0.50 in thalamus;
it increased to 1.07 in frontoparietal cortex, 1.13 in temporal cortex, and 1.25 
in thalamus after 30 min of seizures. With control LC values, LCMRglc in
frontoparietal cortex, temporal cortex, and dorsomedial thalamus appeared to
increase four to sixfold. With seizure LC values, LCMRglc increased 1.5- to
2-fold and only in cortex. During 45-min seizures, LCMRglc in cortex and thalamus
probably increases 4- to 6-fold initially and later falls to the 1.5- to 2-fold
level as tissue glucose concentrations decrease. Together with our previous
results demonstrating depletion of high-energy phosphates and glucose in these
regions, the data suggest that energy demands exceed glucose supply. The
long-term effects of these metabolic changes on the developing brain remain to be
determined.

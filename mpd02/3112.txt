A new Rabies virus variant, with no close antigenic or genetic relationship to
any known rabies variants found in bats or terrestrial mammals in the Americas,
was identified in association with human rabies cases reported from the state of 
Ceará, Brazil, from 1991 to 1998. The marmoset, Callithrix jacchus acchus, was
determined to be the source of exposure.

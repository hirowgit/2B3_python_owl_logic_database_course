BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Bupropion is an atypical antidepressant and smoking
cessation aid associated with wide intersubject variability. This study compared 
the formation kinetics of three phase I metabolites (hydroxybupropion,
threohydrobupropion, and erythrohydrobupropion) in human, marmoset, rat, and
mouse liver microsomes. The objective was to establish suitability and
limitations  for subsequent use of nonclinical species to model bupropion central
nervous system (CNS) disposition in humans.
METHODS: Hepatic microsomal incubations were conducted separately for the R- and 
S-bupropion enantiomers, and the formation of enantiomer-specific metabolites was
determined using LC-MS/MS. Intrinsic formation clearance (CLint) of metabolites
across the four species was determined from the formation rate versus substrate
concentration relationship.
RESULTS: The total clearance of S-bupropion was higher than that of R-bupropion
in monkey and human liver microsomes. The contribution of hydroxybupropion to the
total racemic bupropion clearance was 38%, 62%, 17%, and 96% in human, monkey,
rat, and mouse, respectively.  In the same species order, threohydrobupropion
contributed 53%, 23%, 17%, and 3%, and erythrohydrobupropion contributed 9%, 14%,
66%, and 1.3%, respectively, to racemic bupropion clearance.
CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate that phase I metabolism in monkeys best
approximates that observed in humans, and support the preferred use of this
species to investigate possible pharmacokinetic factors that influence the CNS
disposition of bupropion and contribute to its high intersubject variability.

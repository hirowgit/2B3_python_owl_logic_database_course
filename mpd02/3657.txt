Brain-stem auditory evoked potentials (BAEPs) were recorded in 20 common
marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) to investigate the effects of click frequency up
to 99 kHz, in consideration of the higher hearing range of the marmoset, and
intensity on wave forms and peak latencies. According to the results of BAEP
recordings at frequencies of 4, 32, and 99 kHz, the number of components recorded
was affected by the stimulus intensity and the clicks at an intensity of 80 dB
peak equivalent sound pressure level (pe SPL) had the maximum number of clear
components. Therefore, it was indicated that click stimulations at an intensity
of 80 dB pe SPL over a broad range of frequencies appears to be useful for
recording the maximum number of components in marmosets and may increase the
information obtainable from BAEPs. BAEP latencies were prolonged as the stimulus 
intensity decreased from 100 to 50 dB pe SPL. The effects of stimulus frequency
on the wave latencies and amplitudes in response to 80 dB pe SPL at frequencies
between 0.5 and 99 kHz revealed various changes: the amplitude of wave I
increased at 16 and 32 kHz, but that of waves III and V increased at 4-8 and
64-99 kHz. These increases in amplitudes of the waves may correlate with higher
synchronous activity of the peripheral or central auditory pathways.

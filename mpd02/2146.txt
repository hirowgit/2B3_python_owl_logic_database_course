Here we describe a web-accessible digital brain atlas of the common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus) at http://marmoset-brain.org:2008. We prepared the
histological sections of the marmoset brain using various staining techniques.
For virtual microscopy, high-resolution digital images of sections were obtained 
with Aperio Scanscope. The digital images were then converted to Zoomify files
(zoomable multiresolution image files). Thereby, we could provide the
multiresolution images of the marmoset brains for fast interactive viewing on the
web via the Internet. In addition, we describe an automated method to obtain
drawings of Nissl-stained sections.

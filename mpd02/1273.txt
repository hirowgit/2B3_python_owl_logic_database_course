The social environment influences animal personality on evolutionary and
immediate time scales. However, studies of animal personality rarely assess the
effects of the social environment, particularly in species that live in stable
groups with individualized relationships. We assessed personality experimentally 
in 17 individuals of the common marmoset, living in four groups. We found their
personality to be considerably modified by the social environment. Marmosets
exhibited relatively high plasticity in their behaviour, and showed
'group-personality', i.e. group-level similarity in the personality traits. In
exploratory behaviour this was maintained only in the social environment but not 
when individuals were tested alone, suggesting that exploration tendency is
subjected to social facilitation. Boldness, in contrast, showed higher
consistency across the social and solitary conditions, and the group-level
similarity in trait scores was sustained also outside of the immediate social
environment. The 'group-personality' was not due to genetic relatedness,
supporting that it was produced by social effects. We hypothesize that
'group-personality' may be adaptive for highly cooperative animals through
facilitating cooperation among individuals with similar behavioural tendency.

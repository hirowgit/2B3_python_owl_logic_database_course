The intestinal microflora of common marmosets and rhesus monkeys were compared by
enumerating bacteria from the small and large intestines. Rhesus monkeys had a
consistent microflora pattern manifest by higher concentrations of total and
Gram-negative aerobic and facultatively anaerobic bacteria, as well as aerobic
and anaerobic Lactobacilli, in the large intestine as compared to the small
intestine. In contrast, the marmoset microflora were considerably more variable. 
Approximately two-thirds of the marmosets (designated group A) had an overall
profile that resembled the rhesus monkeys, but they had significantly higher
concentrations of Gram-negative microflora in their large intestines than the
rhesus monkeys. The remaining marmosets (group B) had higher concentrations of
bacteria in the small intestine as compared to the large intestine, with the
large intestinal concentrations being significantly lower than in the rhesus
monkeys and group A marmosets. Moreover, the marmosets did not have detectable
levels of aerobic Lactobacilli, and anaerobic Lactobacilli concentrations were
significantly lower than in the rhesus macaques. Although it is unknown why
microflora differ across species, it is likely that evolutionary adaptations in
anatomy and functioning of the gastrointestinal tract influence the concentration
and types of bacteria residing as the normal intestinal microflora.

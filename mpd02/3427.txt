Callithrix and Leontopithecus exhibit ecological differences that have
implications for the patterns of infant care. In C. jacchus, which uses a small
home range because it depends mainly on plant exudates, infants can forage
independently early in their life. L. chrysomelas, which feeds mainly on fruits
and insects, needs larger home ranges and, therefore, its infants have a more
extensive period of dependence. Three families of C. jacchus and four families of
L. chrysomelas were studied in captivity. The animals were observed starting from
the birth of the infants up to their 8th week of age. Our results suggest that
the pattern of infant transfer in L. chrysomelas did not follow the one reported 
for L. rosalia in that transfers from the mother occurred much earlier. L.
chrysomelas infants were carried for about 15% of total time during the 8th week 
of life against less than 1% in C. jacchus in the same week. Infant care seems to
be more extensive in L. chrysomelas than in C. jacchus, and the period of
exclusive mother carrying in L. chrysomelas is shorter than that observed in L.
rosalia.

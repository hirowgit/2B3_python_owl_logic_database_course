Long-term recordings of the free-running circadian activity rhythm in common
marmosets, Callithrix j. jacchus, living under constant environmental conditions 
(LL 200-470 lx) provided evidence of rhythm splitting in nonhuman primates. In
two out of ten test animals two different types of splitting occurred;
spontaneous persistent splitting and temporary splitting. Neither a reduction of 
the illumination intensity nor the application of dark pulses had any effect on
the two activity components of the persistently split rhythm.

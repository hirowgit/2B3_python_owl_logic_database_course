The relationship of DNA excision repair of ultraviolet-induced lesions to the
maximum life span of mammals.

Francis AA, Lee WH, Regan JD.

Physical and chemical agents present in the environment can potentially damage
mammalian DNA. Such damage is known in some cases to be repaired by the process
of DNA excision repair. This process has been extensively studied utilizing the
repair of ultraviolet irradiation damage as a model system. In this study we have
used this system and the 5-bromodeoxyuridine photolysis assay to measure DNA
excision repair in cells derived from 21 mammalian species. We have attempted to 
relate the DNA repair proficiencies and the average size of the repaired regions 
seen in the cell cultures with the various maximum life spans of the mammals
studied. There was an approximate linear correlation between life span of the
mammals and the number of DNA excision repair sites measured 20-22 hours
following ultraviolet irradiation of the cell cultures. Several deviations from
the linear relationships were observed which remain largely unexplained. The size
of the repaired regions was shown not to be related to the maximum life spans of 
the mammals tested.

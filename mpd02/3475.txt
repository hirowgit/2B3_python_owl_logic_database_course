To validate use of the common cotton-eared marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) in
inhalation toxicity studies, its nasal morphology was examined. The nasal
turbinates each consisted of one maxilloturbinate and one ethmoturbinate: these
were more planar in structure than the comparable structures of rodents or dogs. 
The nasal cavity epithelia comprised squamous epithelium (SE), nasal transitional
epithelium (NTE), respiratory epithelium (RE) and olfactory epithelium (OE),
listed in order of occurrence from anterior to posterior positions. NTE was
distributed as a narrow band lying between SE and RE. OE was limited to the
dorsal part of the cavity, which was structurally similar to that of the macaque 
or man. Overall, this study revealed structural the similarity of the whole nasal
cavity in the marmoset to that of macaques or humans. Prediction of nasal cavity 
changes in man based on extrapolation from experimentally induced changes in the 
common marmoset therefore seems likely to be feasible, making it a useful animal 
model for inhalation studies.

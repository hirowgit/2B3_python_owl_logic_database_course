Composition of the milk of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) and milk
substitutes used in hand-rearing programmes, with special reference to fatty
acids.

Turton JA, Ford DJ, Bleby J, Hall BM, Whiting R.

Analyses of marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) milk were carried out to determine
values for crude protein, lactose, total lipids, major minerals, and osmotic
pressure. Mean values were (g/100 ml): protein, 3.6; lactose, 7.5; total lipids, 
7.7; minerals (mg/100 ml): sodium, 21.4; potassium, 54.3; calcium, 92.2;
phosphorus, 22.8; magnesium, 5.0; chloride, 52.2; osmotic pressure, 354 mosm/kg
water. Similar analyses were conducted on 2 milk substitutes used in hand-rearing
programmes. Fatty acid analyses were carried out on natural milk, the milk
substitutes, and the marmoset diet. For hand-rearing C. jacchus it is recommended
that a human milk substitute is modified by increasing the levels of protein,
carbohydrate, and total lipids, and that a small amount of fish oil is added.

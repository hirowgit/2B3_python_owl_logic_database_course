Monoclonal antibodies (MAb) may provide valuable tools for studying osteoblast
differentiation. We therefore raised a panel of MAb reactive with cells of this
phenotype using 1,25(OH)2D3-treated human trabecular osteoblast-like cells (HOBS)
as the immunogen. Immunohistochemical studies on various tissues, including
undecalcified cryostat sections of fetal and adult human bone, identified 11 bone
cell-reactive MAb. Of these, 2 demonstrated particularly selective reactivities
against osteocytes (OB/M) and osteoblasts (OB/L). These reactivities were also
seen in developing bone from rat, rabbit, and marmoset. OB/L and OB/M
demonstrated limited reactivity against a small number of human tissues from the 
extensive panel of substrates tested. Both MAb exhibited reactivity against
discrete populations of cells in the large and small intestine. In addition, OB/L
reacted with cells in the basal epidermis of skin and OB/M with cells in blood
vessel walls. Both antibodies demonstrated reactivity against a variety of
cultured osteoblast-like cell lines and other cultured cell types. These MAb may 
therefore provide a valuable means of studying osteoblast ontogeny.

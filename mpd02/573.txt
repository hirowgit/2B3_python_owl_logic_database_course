The directed differentiation of pluripotent stem cells to a desired lineage often
involves complex and lengthy protocols. In order to study the requirements for
differentiation in a systematic way, we present here methodology for an iterative
approach using combinations of small molecules and biological factors. The
factors are used in a cyclical process in which the best combination of factors
and concentrations is selected in one round of testing, followed by a
modification of the combination and subsequent rounds. While this may produce the
desired differentiation in the cell population under study, it is also possible
that other strategies may be needed to optimize the differentiation process.
These strategies are described in this chapter.

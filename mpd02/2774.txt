PURPOSE: A nonhuman primate model of generalized absence status epilepticus was
developed for use in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments to 
elucidate the brain mechanisms underlying this disorder.
METHODS: Adult male marmoset monkeys (Callithrix jacchus) were treated with
gamma-butyrolactone (GBL) to induce prolonged absence seizures, and the resulting
spike-wave discharges (SWDs) were analyzed to determine the similarity to the
3-Hz SWDs that characterize the disorder. In addition,
blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI was measured at 4.7 Tesla after
absence seizure induction with GBL.
RESULTS: Electroencephalographic recordings during imaging showed 3-Hz SWDs
typical of human absence seizures. This synchronized EEG pattern started within
15 to 20 min of drug administration and persisted for >60 min. In addition,
pretreatment with the antiepileptic drug, ethosuximide (ESM), blocked the
behavioral and EEG changes caused by GBL. Changes in BOLD signal intensity in the
thalamus and sensorimotor cortex correlated with the onset of 3-Hz SWDs. The
change in BOLD signal intensity was bilateral but heterogeneous, affecting some
brain areas more than others. No significant negative BOLD changes were seen.
CONCLUSIONS: The BOLD fMRI data obtained in this marmoset monkey model of absence
status epilepticus shows activation within the thalamus and cortex.

Infection of freshly isolated and cryopreserved lymphocytes with Epstein-Barr
virus (EBV) leads to the establishment of human B lymphoblastoid cell lines
(LCLs). Techniques for optimal infection of the lymphocytes are vital for the
establishment of a human biobank. The present study found that more than half
(58-86%) of such established LCLs had transport times of less than 48 h, cell
densities exceeding 10(6) cells/ml and cell viabilities greater than 90%. After
EBV infection, 3306 freshly isolated lymphocytes required 30.0 +/- 0.1 days to
become LCLs. Conversely, 1210 cryopreserved lymphocytes required 36.2 +/- 0.4
days. Cell density and viability of the culture affected transformation time in
freshly isolated lymphocytes. On the other hand, blood transport time,
cryopreservation time and initial cell viability were major factors in
cryopreserved specimens. These results contribute to general information
concerning the establishment of a human biobank for EBV infected cells.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) is essential for maintenance
of the episome and establishment of latency. In this study, we observed that heat
treatment effectively induced EBNA1 transcription in EBV-transformed B95-8 and
human LCL cell lines. Although Cp is considered as the sole promoter used for the
expression of EBNA1 transcripts in the lymphoblastoid cell lines, the RT-PCR
results showed that the EBNA1 transcripts induced by heat treatment arise from
Qp-initiated transcripts. Using bioinformatics, a high affinity and functional
heat shock factor 1 (HSF1)-binding element within the -17/+4 oligonucleotide of
the Qp was found, and was determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and 
chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Moreover, heat shock and exogenous HSF1
expression induced Qp activity in reporter assays. Further, RNA
interference-mediated HSF1 gene silencing attenuated heat-induced EBNA1
expression in B95-8 cells. These results provide evidence that EBNA1 is a new
target for the transcription factor HSF1.

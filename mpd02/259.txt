The use of home-based image sensors for biological and environmental monitoring
provides novel insight into health and development but it is difficult to
evaluate people during their normal activities in their home. Therefore, we
developed a low-cost infrared (IR) technology-based motion, location, temperature
and thermal environment detection system that can be used non-invasively for
long-term studies in the home environment. We tested this technology along with
the associated analysis algorithm to visualize the effects of parental care and
thermal environment on developmental state change in a non-human primate model,
the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). To validate this system, we first
compared it to a manual analysis technique and we then assessed the development
of circadian rhythms in common marmosets from postnatal day 15-45. The
semi-automatically tracked biological indices of locomotion velocity (BV) and
body surface temperature (BT) and the potential psychological index of place
preference toward the door (BD), showed age-dependent shifts in circadian phase
patterns. Although environmental variables appeared to affect circadian rhythm
development, principal component analysis and signal superimposing imaging
methods revealed a novel phasic pattern of BD-BT correlation day/night switching 
in animals older than postnatal day 38 (approximately equivalent to one year of
age in humans). The origin of this switch was related to earlier development of
body temperature (BT) rhythms and alteration of psychological behavior rhythms
(BD) around earlier feeding times. We propose that this cost-effective, inclusive
sensing and analytic technique has value for understanding developmental care
conditions for which continual home non-invasive monitoring would be beneficial
and further suggest the potential to adapt this technique for use in humans.

BACKGROUND: As endometriosis is known to be very painful in humans, therapeutic
studies should consider pain-related aspects in experimental animals too. In a
previous study, we found that common marmosets suffering from endometriosis show 
remarkable deviations in social behavior and cognitive tasks.
METHODS: Female marmosets with endometriosis undergoing medical treatment were
tested vs. two control groups (healthy and endometriosis monkeys without
treatment) concerning behavioral aspects, cognitive skills, and mobility.
RESULTS: The treated monkeys performed significant more social and self-grooming,
comfort behavior and were more active than the untreated endometriosis monkeys.
The treated marmosets even returned to equal levels as their healthy
conspecifics. Cognitive and mobility tests revealed no significant differences.
CONCLUSIONS: A beneficial effect of the applied endometriosis medication on
behavioral impairments could be obtained. Including such measurements in
therapeutic research contributes to aspects of animal welfare and pain-relieving 
potential of the tested compound.

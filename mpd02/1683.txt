Line transect distance sampling (LTDS) can be applied to either trails or roads. 
However, it is likely that sampling along roads might result in biased density
estimates. In this paper, we compared the results obtained with LTDS applied on
trails and roads for two primate species (Callithrix penicillata and Callicebus
nigrifrons) to clarify whether roads are appropriate transects to estimate
densities. We performed standard LTDS surveys in two nature reserves in
south-eastern Brazil. Effective strip width and population density were different
between trails and roads for C. penicillata, but not for C. nigrifrons. The
results suggest that roads are not appropriate for use as transects in primate
surveys, at least for some species. Further work is required to fully understand 
this issue, but in the meantime we recommend that researchers avoid using roads
as transects or treat roads and trails as covariates when sampling on roads is
unavoidable.

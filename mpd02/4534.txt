Extraocular muscle motoneurones were localised in the oculomotor nucleus (ON),
trochlear nucleus (TN) and abducens nucleus (AN) in the marmoset brain using the 
horseradish peroxidase (HRP) retrograde labelling technique. HRP pellets injected
into individual extraocular muscles revealed one or more groups of labelled
neurones occupying discrete loci within these nuclei. Relatively little overlap
of motoneurone pools was observed, except in the case of the inferior oblique and
superior rectus muscles. Injections of HRP into the medial rectus muscle revealed
three separate populations of labelled cells in the ipsilateral ON. Motoneurones 
innervating the inferior rectus muscle were mainly localised in the lateral
somatic cell column of the ipsilateral ON. A second smaller grouping was observed
in the medial longitudinal fasciculus. The inferior oblique muscle motoneurones
were localised in the ipsilateral medial somatic cell column intermingled with
motoneurones supplying the superior rectus muscle of the opposite eye. The
superior oblique muscle motoneurones occupied the entire TN and the lateral
rectus muscle motoneurones the AN. It was concluded that the organisation of
nuclei and subnuclei responsible for controlling the extraocular muscles in the
marmoset is broadly similar to that of other primates.

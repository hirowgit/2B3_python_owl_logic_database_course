The zona pellucida surrounding the mammalian oocyte contains a major glycoprotein
species, ZP3, that serves as a cell- and species-specific receptor for
spermatozoa. In this study we have determined the primary amino acid structure of
marmoset ZP3 (marZP3) and examined the expression of marZP3 mRNA within the
ovary. The marZP3 gene possesses an open reading frame of 1272 nucleotides which 
is expressed specifically by the oocyte and encodes a polypeptide chain of 424
amino acids that exhibits 91% homology with the human ZP3 sequence. The disparity
between these molecules was confined to a short domain spanning residues 322-352;
otherwise the molecules were very similar, showing conservation of many
structural features including the N-linked glycosylation sites, location and
number of cysteine and proline residues and hydrophobicity profile. The results
of this study have important implications for the use of the marmoset monkey as
an animal model for the development of contraceptive vaccines targeting ZP3.

Virtually, all research on basic mechanisms of aging has used species that are
short lived and thus demonstrably unsuccessful at combating basic aging
processes. A novel comparative approach would use a diversity of populations and 
species, focusing on those with particularly long, healthy lives, seeking the
causative mechanisms that distinguish them from shorter lived relatives. Species 
of interest from this perspective include the naked mole rat, a mouse-size rodent
that lives up to 30 years in the laboratory, and the little brown bat, which
lives up to 34 years in the wild. Comparisons among dogs of different sizes,
which differ by more than 50% in health span might also prove rewarding, as might
novel species chosen because of their similarity to humans in certain key traits.
Primates, because of their sophisticated cognitive ability, are a group of
special value, and small, short-lived primates like the common marmoset might
prove especially beneficial. Cell repositories and tissue banks from key species,
as well as genomic and analytic tools optimized for comparative studies, would
make valuable contributions to a new comparative approach to basic aging
research.

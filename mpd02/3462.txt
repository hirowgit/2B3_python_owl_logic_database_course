The STP oncoproteins of the herpesvirus saimiri (HVS) subgroup A strain 11 and
subgroup C strain 488 are now found to be stably associated with tumor necrosis
factor receptor-associated factor (TRAF) 1, 2, or 3. Mutational analyses
identified residues of PXQXT/S in STP-A11 as critical for TRAF association. In
addition, a somewhat divergent region of STP-C488 is critical for TRAF
association. Mutational analysis also revealed that STP-C488 induced NF-kappaB
activation that was correlated with its ability to associate with TRAFs. The HVS 
STP-C488 P10-->R mutant was deficient in human T-lymphocyte transformation to
interleukin-2-independent growth but showed wild-type phenotype for marmoset
T-lymphocyte transformation in vitro and in vivo. The STP-C488 P10-->R mutant was
also defective in Rat-1 fibroblast transformation, and fibroblast cell
transformation was blocked by a TRAF2 dominant-negative mutant. These data
implicate TRAFs in STP-C488-mediated transformation of human lymphocytes and
rodent fibroblasts. Other factors are implicated in immortalization of common
marmoset T lymphocytes and may also be critical in the transformation of human
lymphocytes and rodent fibroblasts.

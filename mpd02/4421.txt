The histochemical locations of alkaline phosphate (ALP), leucine aminopeptidase
(LAP) and gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT) were demonstrated in the liver of the
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). Although all three enzymes were located in cell
membranes, the location of LAP was demonstrated by a chromogenic substrate, in
the canalicular membrane. GGT was seen in a vascular network, provisionally
identified as the peribiliary arterial plexus. Possible diagnostic applications
in toxicology are discussed.

Traditionally, the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and the inferior
pulvinar (IPul) nucleus are considered as anatomically and functionally distinct 
thalamic nuclei. However, in several primate species it has also been established
that the koniocellular (K) layers of LGN and parts of the IPul have a shared
pattern of immunoreactivity for the calcium-binding protein calbindin. These
calbindin-rich cells constitute a thalamic matrix system which is implicated in
thalamocortical synchronisation. Further, the K layers and IPul are both involved
in visual processing and have similar connections with retina and superior
colliculus. Here, we confirmed the continuity between calbindin-rich cells in LGN
K layers and the central lateral division of IPul (IPulCL) in marmoset monkeys.
By employing a high-throughput neuronal tracing method, we found that both the K 
layers and IPulCL form comparable patterns of connections with striate and
extrastriate cortices; these connections are largely different to those of the
parvocellular and magnocellular laminae of LGN. Retrograde tracer-labelled cells 
and anterograde tracer-labelled axon terminals merged seamlessly from IPulCL into
LGN K layers. These results support continuity between LGN K layers and IPulCL,
providing an anatomical basis for functional congruity of this region of the
dorsal thalamic matrix and calling into question the traditional segregation
between LGN and the inferior pulvinar nucleus.

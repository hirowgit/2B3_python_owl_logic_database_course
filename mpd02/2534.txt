fails to inhibit virus replication.

A chemically synthesized peptide representing the C-terminal subunit (p13-C) of
the p13 protein of GB virus B (GBV-B), the most closely related virus to
hepatitis C virus (HCV) showed ion channel activity in artificial lipid bilayers.
The channels had a variable conductance and were more permeable to potassium ions
than to chloride ions. Amantadine but not hexamethylene amiloride (HMA) inhibited
the ion channel function of p13-C in the lipid membranes. However, neither agent 
was able to inhibit the replication and secretion of GBV-B from virus-infected
cultured marmoset hepatocytes, which were harvested from a marmoset that was
infected in vivo or inhibit replication after in vitro infection of naive
hepatocytes. These data suggest that the GBV-B ion channel, contrary to the data 
derived from the lipid membranes, is either resistant to amantadine or that virus
replication and secretion are independent of ion channel function. As the p7
protein of HCV also has ion channel activity that is apparently resistant to
amantadine in vivo, the former possibility is most likely. Ion channels are
likely to have an important role in the life cycle of many viruses and compounds 
that block these channels may prove to be useful antiviral agents.

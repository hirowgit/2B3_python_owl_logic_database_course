The methylation of inorganic arsenic to monomethylarsonic acid (MMA) and
dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) have been generally considered to be the major pathway
for inorganic arsenic biotransformation and detoxification. Yet, when
arsenate/arsenite is injected into the Callithrix jacchus (marmoset) monkey or
chimpanzee, monomethylarsonic acid and dimethylarsinic acid are not found in the 
urine. With the development of a rapid assay for the methyltransferases of
arsenic metabolism, we have investigated the methyltransferases of the marmoset
monkey liver. We have found that the marmoset, a New World animal, is deficient
in liver arsenite and monomethylarsonic acid methyltransferase activities.
However, the rhesus monkey, an Old World animal, has ample amounts of such
methyltransferase activities. The tamarin, another New World species, is also
deficient in these methyltransferases. Polymorphism and deficiency of these
methyltransferases may have allowed high levels of arsenite to be maintained in
the blood and liver of the marmoset and tamarin. Such high levels of arsenite may
have been selective for survival of the species. The rhesus liver
methyltransferases for arsenite and MMA have been purified and found to have some
properties different from those of the previously reported purified rabbit liver 
activities. The rhesus and rabbit liver arsenite and MMA methyltransferases are
devoid of catechol O-methyltransferase activity.

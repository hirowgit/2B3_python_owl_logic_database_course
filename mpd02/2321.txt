We investigated the organization of frontoparietal cortex in the common marmoset 
(Callithrix jacchus) by using intracortical microstimulation and an architectonic
analysis. Primary motor cortex (M1) was identified as an area that evoked visible
movements at low levels of electric current and had a full body representation of
the contralateral musculature. Primary motor cortex represented the contralateral
body from hindlimb to face in a mediolateral sequence, with individual movements 
such as jaw and wrist represented in multiple nearby locations. Primary motor
cortex was coextensive with an agranular area of cortex marked by a distinct
layer V of large pyramidal cells that gradually decreased in size toward the
rostral portion of the area and was more homogenous in appearance than other New 
World primates. In addition to M1, stimulation also evoked movements from several
other areas of frontoparietal cortex. Caudal to primary motor cortex, area 3a was
identified as a thin strip of cortex where movements could be evoked at
thresholds similar to those in M1. Rostral to primary motor cortex, supplementary
motor cortex and premotor areas responded to higher stimulation currents and had 
smaller layer V pyramidal cells. Other areas evoking movements included primary
somatosensory cortex (area 3b), two lateral somatosensory areas (areas PV and
S2), and a caudal somatosensory area. Our results suggest that frontoparietal
cortex in marmosets is organized in a similar fashion to that of other New World 
primates.

Effects of arecoline and pilocarpine on learning ability in marmosets pretreated 
with hemicholinium-3.

Ridley RM, Baker HF, Drewett B.

Common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) were trained to perform serial reversal
position discrimination tasks in a Wisconsin General Test Apparatus.
Intraventricular injection of hemicholinium-3 4 h before testing resulted in a
profound impairment of position discrimination learning which could be overcome
by the intramuscular administration of low doses of the muscarinic agonists,
arecoline or pilocarpine.

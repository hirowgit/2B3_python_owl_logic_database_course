Embryonic stem (ES) cell is well known as a totipotent cell, which is derived
from a blastcyst and has potential to differentiate into every kind of somatic
cell. ES cell bears self-renewal characteristic as well as differentiation
potential. ES cell bears telomerase activity to avoid telomere shortening, which 
is a characteristic of differentiated somatic cells. As the differentiation of ES
cells proceeds, their telomerase activity is losing. However, it has not been
convinced whether suppression of the telomerase activity promotes progression of 
ES cell differentiation. The effect of telomerase inhibitor on the
differentiation potential of marmoset ES cell was assessed, counting cells
expressing embryonic markers (alkaline phosphatase and TPA-1-60) under existence 
of a telomerase inhibitor. Telomerase inhibitor showed a promotional effect for
the marmoset ES cell differentiation. This result suggests that exogenous
inhibition of telomerase activity leads to induction of an early differentiation 
of primate ES cell.

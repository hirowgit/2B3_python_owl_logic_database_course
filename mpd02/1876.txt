The pattern of myelination over the cerebral cortex, termed myeloarchitecture, is
an established and often-used feature to visualize cortical organization with
histology in a variety of primate species. In this paper, we use in vivo magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) and advanced image processing using surface rendering to 
visualize and characterize myeloarchitecture in a small nonhuman primate, the
common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). Through images made in four female adult
marmosets, we produce a representative 3D map of marmoset myeloarchitecture and
flatten and annotate this map to show the location and extent of a variety of
major areas of the cortex, including the primary visual, auditory, and
somatosensory areas. By treating our MRI data as a surface, we can measure the
surface area of cortical areas, and we present these measurements here to
summarize cortical organization in the marmoset.

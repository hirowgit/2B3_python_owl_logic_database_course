A DNA fragment covering marmoset interferon gamma (MaIFN-gamma) was cloned from
the DNA of peripheral blood leucocytes, sequenced and compared to its human
IFN-gamma counterpart. The two nucleotide sequences were found to be highly
homologous (90.3%). The position of the exons are directly comparable with those 
of the human IFN-gamma gene and follows the pattern of structural conservation
found elsewhere. The present work makes available recombinant MaIFN-gamma for
animal experiments.

In chronic (relapsing) inflammatory polyneuropathy (CRIP), successful treatment
with plasma exchange has led to the concept of pathogenic humoral factors. In 6
patients with CRIP, 5 of whom improved after plasma exchange, the potential
pathogenic role of circulating immunoglobulin (Ig) fractions was tested by
applying the systemic passive transfer model to marmoset monkeys. After
continuous treatment with intramuscular injections for 2-8 weeks, monkeys
injected with the crude immunoglobulin fractions or with purified IgG from 5 of
the 6 patients showed a significant and partially reversible reduction of the
motor nerve conduction velocity (mean 34%, P less than 0.001) when compared with 
pre-treatment values. In control animals the reduction was 4%. Morphological
examination revealed only minor ultrastructural changes of the myelin sheath.
Immunocytochemistry revealed that human IgG was able to cross the blood-nerve
barrier. It is concluded that the circulating IgG-fraction of patients with CRIP 
contains a factor that may contribute to the disordered nerve function after
crossing the blood-nerve barrier. It may be the removal of this particular factor
which is responsible for the rapid recovery of nerve conduction in patients after
plasma exchange.

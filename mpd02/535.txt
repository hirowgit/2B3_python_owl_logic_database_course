Pseudotyped lentiviral vectors give access to pathway-selective gene manipulation
via retrograde transfer. Two types of such lentiviral vectors have been
developed. One is the so-called NeuRet vector pseudotyped with fusion
glycoprotein type E, which preferentially transduces neurons. The other is the
so-called HiRet vector pseudotyped with fusion glycoprotein type B2, which
permits gene transfer into both neurons and glial cells at the injection site.
Although these vectors have been applied in many studies investigating neural
network functions, it remains unclear which vector is more appropriate for
retrograde gene delivery in the brain. To compare the gene transfer efficiency
and inflammatory response of the NeuRet vs. HiRet vectors, each vector was
injected into the striatum in macaque monkeys, common marmosets, and rats. It was
revealed that retrograde gene delivery of the NeuRet vector was equal to or
greater than that of the HiRet vector. Furthermore, inflammation characterized by
microglial and lymphocytic infiltration occurred when the HiRet vector, but not
the NeuRet vector, was injected into the primate brain. The present results
indicate that the NeuRet vector is more suitable than the HiRet vector for
retrograde gene transfer in the primate and rodent brains.

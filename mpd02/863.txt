Human idiopathic inflammatory demyelinating diseases (IIDD) are a heterogeneous
group of autoimmune inflammatory and demyelinating disorders of the central
nervous system (CNS). These include multiple sclerosis (MS), the most common
chronic IIDD, but also rarer disorders such as acute disseminated
encephalomyelitis (ADEM) and neuromyelitis optica (NMO). Great efforts have been 
made to understand the pathophysiology of MS, leading to the development of a few
effective treatments. Nonetheless, IIDD still require a better understanding of
the causes and underlying mechanisms to implement more effective therapies and
diagnostic methods. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a commonly
used animal model to study the pathophysiology of IIDD. EAE is principally
induced through immunization with myelin antigens combined with immune-activating
adjuvants. Nonhuman primates (NHP), the phylogenetically closest relatives of
humans, challenged by similar microorganisms as other primates may recapitulate
comparable immune responses to that of humans. In this review, the authors
describe EAE models in 3 NHP species: rhesus macaques ( Macaca mulatta),
cynomolgus macaques ( Macaca fascicularis), and common marmosets ( Callithrix
jacchus), evaluating their respective contribution to the understanding of human 
IIDD. EAE in NHP is a heterogeneous disease, including acute monophasic and
chronic polyphasic forms. This diversity makes it a versatile model to use in
translational research. This clinical variability also creates an opportunity to 
explore multiple facets of immune-mediated mechanisms of neuro-inflammation and
demyelination as well as intrinsic protective mechanisms. Here, the authors
review current insights into the pathogenesis and immunopathological mechanisms
implicated in the development of EAE in NHP.

The brain of the marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).

Prado Reis F, Abrantes Erhart E.

The gross anatomy and the internal structure of the marmoset (Callithrix jacchus)
brain are described based on the observations made on the material obtained from 
10 adult animals (native name: sagui). 5 brains were used for gross anatomical
observations; the other 5 brains, included in toto in celloidin, were cut into
serial sections, properly stained and used for comparative studies of the
internal structure. Only general descriptions are given considering the brain
because, in further papers, it is intended to go on describing in details the
nervous system of this small primate, very common in Brazilian jungles and easily
domesticated. It shows to be a very good and inexpensive animal for
neurophysiological experiments.

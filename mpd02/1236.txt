We report a preclinical study of a pyrrole-imidazole (PI) polyamide that targets 
the human transforming growth factor (hTGF)-β1 gene as a novel transcriptional
gene silencer in a common marmoset primate model. We designed and then
synthesized PI polyamides to target the hTGF-β1 promoter. We examined effects of 
seven PI polyamides (GB1101-1107) on the expression of hTGF-β1 mRNA stimulated
with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) in human vascular smooth muscle cells.
GB1101, GB1105 and GB1106 significantly inhibited hTGF-β1 mRNA expression. We
examined GB1101 as a PI polyamide to hTGF-β1 for hypertrophic scars in marmosets 
in vivo. Injection of GB1101 completely inhibited hypertrophic scar formation at 
35 days post-incision and inhibited cellular infiltration, TGF-β1 and vimentin
staining, and epidermal thickness. Mismatch polyamide did not affect hypertrophic
scarring or histological changes. Epidermis was significantly thinner with GB1101
than with water and mismatch PI polyamides. We developed the PI polyamides for
practical ointment medicines for the treatment of hypertrophic scars.
FITC-labeled GB1101 with solbase most efficiently distributed in the nuclei of
epidermal keratinocytes, completely suppressed hypertropic scarring at 42 days
after incision, and considerably inhibited epidermal thickness and
vimentin-positive fibroblasts. PI polyamides targeting hTGF-β1 promoter with
solbase ointment will be practical medicines for treating hypertrophic scars
after surgical operations and skin burns.

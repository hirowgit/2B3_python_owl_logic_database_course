BACKGROUND: The capuchin is a neotropical primate that presents easy reproduction
in captivity and is used in scientific research. The objective of this work was
to describe the structure and the branching pattern of the brachial plexus of the
capuchin and to compare the results with data from the literature for humans,
chimpanzees, baboons and Callithrix.
METHODS: Twelve specimens were used: eight males and four females. No animals
were killed for the purpose of this study.
RESULTS: The brachial plexus of Sapajus sp was constituted mainly from the
ventral roots of the last four cervical spinal nerves, from C5 to C8, mainly, and
the first thoracic nerve (T1).
CONCLUSIONS: The pattern of formation of the brachial plexus of the capuchin
monkey was more similar to that of Callithrix and baboons, perhaps because they
are the only primates in this study to be essentially quadrupedal.

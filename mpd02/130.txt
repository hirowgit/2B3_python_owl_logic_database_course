Humans have used non-human primates (hereafter referred to as primates) as food
source, medicine, parts of rituals, pets, and models for various studies
worldwide. Here we investigated the extent of the use of primates by humans in
three areas in northeastern Brazil, the country's most impoverished region. We
carried out our study in three biomes (Caatinga, Cerrado, and Atlantic Forest).
The results showed that humans exploited all five primate species occurring in
the study sites: Callithrix jacchus, Sapajus flavius, Sapajus
libidinosus, Alouatta belzebul, and Alouatta ululata. They used the primates as a
food source, as pets and medicines, and for leisure. Despite socioeconomic
differences in the study areas, we found similarities in the use of primates.
Larger primates were targeted for meat, whereas the small common marmosets were
targeted as pets. We found conflicting interactions between humans and bearded
capuchins due to crop raiding, but no such conflict was found between humans and 
blonde capuchins, reflecting the differences in crop type, pattern, and tradition
in the sites. A. ululata was used as medicine. We suggest that environmental
education actions in the study areas should focus on (i) raising awareness among 
local people of the ecological importance of primates, (ii) providing alternative
activities to hunting whenever possible, and (iii) minimising conflicts.

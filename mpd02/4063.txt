B lymphocytes from tonsillar tissue of an asymptomatic HIV-1-seropositive subject
were transformed with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and tested for the production of
HIV-1-specific antibodies by ELISA, using purified HIV-1SF2.2F11, a monoclonal
antibody derived from a transformed line, is of the IgG1 subclass and recognizes 
an epitope in the conserved region of the envelope transmembrane glycoprotein
gp41, which is expressed on the surface of HIV-infected T cells. The antibody
does not mediate the lysis of infected T cells in antibody-dependent cellular
cytotoxicity (ADCC) assays and does not neutralize the infectivity of HIV-1SF2 or
the homologous isolate HIV-1TT2.2F11 appears to be the first anti-gp41 human
monoclonal antibody that enhances the infectivity of an HIV-1 strain (i.e.,
SF128A) in the absence of complement.

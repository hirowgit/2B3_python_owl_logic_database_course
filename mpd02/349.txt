Common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) are frequently used for biomedical research
but gastrointestinal diseases have been major health problems to maintain captive
marmosets. We have diagnosed a novel gastrointestinal disease in marmosets, as
which we propose to call 'marmoset duodenal dilation syndrome'; this disease is
characterised by proximal duodenal obstruction and dilation. This study aimed to 
reveal the clinical and pathological findings of this syndrome and establish
appropriate diagnostic imaging methods. Animals with the syndrome comprised 21.9%
of the necropsy cases at the Central Institute for Experimental Animals in
Kawasaki, Japan. The syndrome is characterised by clinical signs included
vomiting, bloating, and weight loss. Grossly, all diseased animals exhibited
significant dilation of the descending part of the duodenum, which contained a
mixture of gas and fluid. The duodenal dilations were definitively diagnosed by
contrast radiography. Moreover, a combination of plain radiography and
ultrasonography was found to be a viable screening method for diagnosing duodenal
dilation. The animals with duodenal dilation characteristically showed adhesions 
between the descending duodenum and ascending colon with chronic peritonitis. The
cause of marmoset duodenal dilation syndrome remains unknown, but was likely
multifactorial, including peritoneal adhesion, chronic ulcer, and feeding
conditions in this study.

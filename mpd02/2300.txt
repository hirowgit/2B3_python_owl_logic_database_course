BACKGROUND: Serum protein analysis in both humans and experimental animal species
has so far been carried out by labor-intensive techniques, such as agarose gel
electrophoresis (AGE).
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate capillary electrophoresis 
(CE) as an alternative technique to AGE for the analysis of serum proteins from
healthy animals.
METHODS: Blood samples were collected into tubes without anticoagulant from 6
fasted healthy male mice, rats, dogs, marmosets, and humans. Serum proteins were 
separated by CE using a technique standardized for the analysis of human
proteins, and the results (efficiency, resolution, and precision) were compared
with those obtained through AGE.
RESULTS: Compared with AGE, CE resulted in narrower peaks and more peaks. The
efficiency of protein separation by CE was significantly higher for all species, 
and resolution (R) was significantly higher in samples from dogs. Using rat
serum, intraday reproducibility was lower for all protein fractions, and interday
reproducibility was lower for most peaks, compared with AGE.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that CE is a viable alternative to AGE for the
determination of protein electrophoresis in a routine veterinary clinical
pathology laboratory. The minimal sample requirement (2 microL), complete
automation, and quantitative results make CE an especially valuable technique for
protein analysis in experimental animal models.

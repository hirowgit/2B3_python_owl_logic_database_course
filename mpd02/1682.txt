Speaking is a sensory-motor process that involves constant self-monitoring to
ensure accurate vocal production. Self-monitoring of vocal feedback allows rapid 
adjustment to correct perceived differences between intended and produced
vocalizations. One important behavior in vocal feedback control is a compensatory
increase in vocal intensity in response to noise masking during vocal production,
commonly referred to as the Lombard effect. This behavior requires mechanisms for
continuously monitoring auditory feedback during speaking. However, the
underlying neural mechanisms are poorly understood. Here we show that when
marmoset monkeys vocalize in the presence of masking noise that disrupts vocal
feedback, the compensatory increase in vocal intensity is accompanied by a shift 
in auditory cortex activity toward neural response patterns seen during
vocalizations under normal feedback condition. Furthermore, we show that neural
activity in auditory cortex during a vocalization phrase predicts vocal intensity
compensation in subsequent phrases. These observations demonstrate that the
auditory cortex participates in self-monitoring during the Lombard effect, and
may play a role in the compensation of noise masking during feedback-mediated
vocal control.

Growth-associated protein-43 is a specific neuronal protein that regulates
differentiation, growth and plasticity. In the present study, growth-associated
protein-43 expression was studied in the lens of rats and primates (including
man) at different postnatal ages by immunoblotting, immunohistochemistry and
quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Growth-associated protein-43
was expressed at all ages in primates and in developing, but not in adult rats.
We demonstrate that the lens - a tissue that is devoid of nerves - expresses
growth-associated protein-43 throughout life in primates, and in rats during
development but not in adulthood. These results suggest that growth-associated
protein-43 is involved in differentiation processes also outside the nervous
system.

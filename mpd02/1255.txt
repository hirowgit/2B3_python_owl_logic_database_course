Since the availability of the common marmoset monkey as a primate model in
neuroscience research has recently increased, much effort has been made to
develop a reliable guide of the brain structures of this species. In this
article, we review the development of the marmoset brain atlas and discuss a
newly developed brain model, which was reconstructed from histological sections
under volume-rendering technology. This kind of brain model allows virtual
sections to be constructed on any axis, with nomenclatural annotations to
structures in situ. This model is also applicable for the identification of
structures revealed in magnetic resonance imaging studies. The brain model is
accessible at the following web address:

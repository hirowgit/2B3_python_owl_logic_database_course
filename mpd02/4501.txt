Hydroxypregnanolone is the most abundant progesterone metabolite in the urine of 
marmoset monkeys (Callithrix jacchus). The substance is excreted as conjugate.
The concentration of this steroid may be monitored by high performance, thin
layer chromatography and postchromatographic derivatization. Hydroxypregnanolone 
was purified and subsequently identified by NMR spectroscopy and gas
chromatography/mass spectroscopy. The exact chemical structure is 5
alpha-pregnane-3 alpha, 7 alpha-diol-20-one.

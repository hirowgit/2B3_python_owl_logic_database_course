We investigated the characteristics of serial order learning in common marmosets 
(Callithrix jacchus). Five marmosets were trained in a sequential responding task
in which they were required to touch four graphic patterns in a given order
(A→B→C→D) to obtain a reward. All five marmosets learned the task with over 65%
accuracy. Shuffling the positions of B, C, and D immediately after the marmoset
had correctly identified and selected the first stimulus (A) either decreased
accuracy or lengthened response latency for the second stimulus (B). These
results suggest that the marmosets planned the response to the second stimulus
before they touched the first stimulus. In addition, when we presented a pair of 
stimuli (AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, and CD pairs), the marmosets responded to the
stimuli in the pair in the appropriate order, according to the learned order
(A→B→C→D). The analyses of first and second response latencies clearly
demonstrated both the first-item and missing-item effects in task performance.
Our data provide direct evidence that marmosets can learn the relative order of
the four stimuli in a sequential responding task.

The ubiquitous enzyme TNAP (tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase) is found in
numerous tissues such as liver, kidney and bone, but little attention has been
paid to its expression and role in the brain. Observations in TNAP-KO mice, which
analyzed the role of this enzyme in osteogenesis, had suggested that TNAP might
be involved in GABA neurotransmission. Apart from its presence in endothelial
cells, here we show a specific and strong alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity in
the neuropile, matching the pattern of thalamo-cortical innervation in layer 4 of
the primate sensory cortices (visual, auditory and somatosensory). Such a pattern
is also evident in rodents and carnivores, making AP a powerful marker of primary
sensory areas. Remarkably, AP activity is regulated by sensory experience as
demonstrated by monocular deprivation paradigms in monkeys. The areal and laminar
distribution of AP activity matches that of the GAD(65), the GABA synthesizing
enzyme found in presynatic terminals. As our electron microscopic investigations 
indicate that AP is found at the neuronal membranes and in synaptic contacts, it 
is proposed that the neuronal AP isoform (NAP), may be a key enzyme in regulating
neurotransmission and could therefore play an important role in developmental
plasticity and activity-dependent cortical functions.

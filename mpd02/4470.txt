Infection with Plasmodium vivax was established in splenectomized Callithrix
jacchus marmosets by inoculation of parasitized blood from Aotus trivirgatus
carrying the Vietnam Palo-Alto line of P. vivax. Subsequent blood passage through
intact marmosets resulted in higher peak parasitaemias (about 1% of red cells
infected) and the loss of stainable Sch√ºffner's dots in infected cells. Primary
infections with the adapted line were patent for 74 days or more, and induced
both a substantial antibody response, as determined by indirect fluorescence, and
some lymphocytosis, but no marked anaemia. Marmosets which had recovered from
their primary infection (or in which it was drug-cured) suffered abbreviated
patency with low-grade parasitaemia on re-infection.

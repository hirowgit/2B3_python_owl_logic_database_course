The effects of a single treatment or chronic administration of cabergoline
(1-[(6-allylergolin-8beta-yl)carbonyl]-1-[3-(dimethylamino)p
ropyl]-3-ethyl-urea), a potent, long-lasting dopamine receptor agonist, on
parkinsonism induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) in
common marmosets were studied. The administration of 0.2 mg/kg or a higer dose of
cabergoline began to reverse parkinsonism-like symptoms 60 min after a
subcutaneous injection, and showed steady and constant effects throughout the
observation period. For prolonged administration, 0.2 mg/kg cabergoline was
injected daily for 22 consecutive days. Locomotor activity in MPTP-treated
animals increased until it reached its peak on the third day, then it gradually
decreased. Akinesia scores, rating the quality of movements, were also improved, 
and the improvement was sustained up to the last day of chronic administration.
None of the animals developed abnormal behaviors after either acute or chronic
administration. These results suggest that cabergoline has long-acting effects in
the marmoset model of parkinsonism, and that it will be a useful agent for the
treatment of Parkinson's disease, particularly in cases with fluctuating motor
disabilities.

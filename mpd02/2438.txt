Our study presents a detailed description of infanticide and cannibalism in a
free-ranging plurally breeding group of Callithrix jacchus. The 1-month-old
infant was the daughter of the dominant female, and was attacked by the group's
second breeding female. Two months later, the latter gave birth to twins and
appeared to have become the dominant female. These findings confirm and extend
previous reports of infanticide by pregnant female marmosets, and indicate that
infants of dominant breeding female, as well as those of subordinate females, are
vulnerable to infanticide in plurally breeding groups. With respect to the
cannibalism, this act seemed to be mainly a response to the prompt availability
of food, represented by the killed infant.

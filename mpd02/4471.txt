The protein requirement for maintenance of the marmoset Callithrix jacchus was
investigated by factorial calculation via the N balance technique. Six adult male
marmosets were fed a protein-free pelleted diet for 22 days. When a low protein
diet (6%) was fed in the preperiod, only 7 days were necessary and when fed a
higher protein diet (18%) 10 days were necessary to reach a minimum of N
excretion during protein depletion. Body weight losses averaged 11% and food
intake was 21% lower in the protein free period. The average endogenous urine N
(EUN) was 62.1 mg N and endogenous fecal N (EFN) 49.2 mg N/kg W0.75. Body surface
losses (BSN) were assumed to be 20 mg N/kg W0.75. The total endogenous loss of
131.3 mg N/kg W0.75 is similar to that of other species. Net protein utilization 
(NPU) of well balanced proteins, determined near the N equilibrium, was 51.8%.
The calculated net protein requirement amounts to 313.6 mg N/kg W0.75, which
corresponds to a dietary protein content of 6% in a diet of high caloric density,
(about 19-20 MJ/kg dry matter) when the food intake is 3.3% of body weight.

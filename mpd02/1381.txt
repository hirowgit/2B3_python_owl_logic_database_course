This report is the first description of dosing procedures, pharmacokinetics,
biochemical action, and general tolerability of the antiaging drug rapamycin in
the common marmoset, a small and short-lived monkey. Eudragit-encapsulated
rapamycin was given orally to trained marmosets in a short-term (3 weeks) and a
long-term (14 months) study. Circulating trough rapamycin levels (mean = 5.2
ng/mL; 1.93-10.73 ng/mL) achieved at roughly 1.0 mg/kg/day was comparable to
those reported in studies of rodents and within the therapeutic range for humans.
Long-term treated animals (6/8) indicated a reduction in mammalian target of
rapamycin complex 1 signaling as noted by a decrease in the phospho rpS6 to total
rpS6 ratio after 2 weeks of treatment. All long-term treated subjects had
detectable concentrations of rapamycin in liver (4.7-19.9 pg/mg) and adipose
tissue (2.2-32.8 pg/mg) with reduced mammalian target of rapamycin signaling in
these tissues. There was no evidence of clinical anemia, fibrotic lung changes,
or mouth ulcers. The observed death rate in the long-term study was as expected
given the animals' ages. The ability to rapidly and reliably dose socially housed
marmosets with an oral form of rapamycin that is well tolerated and that
demonstrates a suppression of the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway leads us 
to conclude that this species offers a viable model for rapamycin testing to
establish safety and efficacy for long-term antiaging intervention.

Passive transfer studies in demyelinating neuropathy with IgM monoclonal
antibodies to myelin-associated glycoprotein.

Steck AJ, Murray N, Justafre JC, Meier C, Toyka KV, Heininger K, Stoll G.

Serum or IgM fraction from two patients with a demyelinating neuropathy and IgM
monoclonal antibodies to myelin-associated glycoprotein were injected in three
different animal species. There were no clinical, electrophysiological or
morphological signs of demyelination in either chronic or acute passive transfer 
experiments. These results suggest that the pathogenesis of this human
demyelinating neuropathy may be more complex than has been assumed.

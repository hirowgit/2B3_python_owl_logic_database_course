A peptide purified from human ovarian follicular fluid (hOFFP) was administered
during the follicular phase of post-partum marmosets. Four of the five animals
treated with hOFFP, ovulated as evidenced by the presence of ovarian stigmata at 
the time of laparotomy. However, only 2 of these animals became pregnant, one had
a normal delivery while the other aborted. A shortening of the luteal phase was
observed in the other three animals and all animals conceived in subsequent
cycles. The results indicated that treatment with the ovarian follicular fluid
peptide resulted in impairment of fertility as a result of luteal insufficiency.

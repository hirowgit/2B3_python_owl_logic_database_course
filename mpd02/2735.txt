Noroviruses, with Norwalk virus as the prototype strain, are the most common
cause of viral gastroenteritis in people of all ages. Limited information on the 
immunology of Norovirus infections has been obtained by studies both in the
natural setting and in experimentally infected volunteers. Interpretation of
these studies is difficult due to the lack of information on the history of
Norovirus exposure and the cross-reactivity of antibodies. An animal model for
Norovirus infections would be important to study the immune response, e.g., for
vaccine assessment. In the present study the susceptibility of common marmosets, 
cotton top tamarins, cynomolgus, and rhesus macaques to Norovirus infection was
tested. Following oral inoculation, low level replication may have occurred in
common marmosets and cotton top tamarins but not in cynomolgus macaques, based on
short-term viral shedding; neither clinical symptoms nor antibody responses were 
observed in these species. In contrast, rhesus macaques were found susceptible to
Norwalk virus infection as one animal shed virus for a longer period of time and 
developed Norwalk virus specific IgM and IgG responses. Further research on
Norovirus susceptibility in rhesus macaques may yield an animal model to study
the immune response and pathogenesis after Norovirus infection.

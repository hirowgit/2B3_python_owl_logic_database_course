Handedness has been widely studied in nonhuman primates. However, few studies
investigate this behavior throughout ontogenetic development. To determine the
influence of developmental stage in common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) females,
we used six animals, which were observed in food-reaching tests involving
hand-use preference from the infantile to the adult phase. During this period,
fecal samples were collected for sexual hormone analysis (estrogen and
progesterone). The results point to correlations between age and stabilization of
manual preference across the developmental phases. A relationship between
progesterone and the intensity of hand use asymmetry was observed during the
pubertal period, when the data was grouped into three phases: prepubertal,
pubertal, and postpubertal. These data show increasing strength of hand
preference during ontogenetic development and that sexual hormones may be
involved in females.

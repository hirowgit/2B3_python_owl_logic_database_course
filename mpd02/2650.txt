Using a non-invasive method of sampling saliva followed by assay for cortisol
levels, we found that common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) show a decrease in
cortisol levels after seeing a snake-model stimulus that reliably elicits mobbing
(tsik) calls. In fact, there was a significant positive correlation between the
number of tsik vocalizations made and the magnitude of the decrease in the
cortisol concentrations. Furthermore, marmosets with higher levels of cortisol
prior to being exposed to the stimulus produce more tsik calls than those with
lower levels of cortisol. Subsequent experiments showed that, in response to 15
min of isolation with no visual or auditory contact with conspecifics (a
traditional stressor), cortisol levels increased significantly. However, playback
of the mobbing calls of a familiar conspecific to individual isolated marmosets
not only prevented the rise in cortisol, but also actually caused a decrease in
the levels of this hormone. This suggests that the mobbing calls serve to calm
the marmoset after experiencing a stressful situation. This finding results in a 
greater understanding as to the role of physiological responses during
communication in this species and could have implications for the welfare of
marmosets in captivity.

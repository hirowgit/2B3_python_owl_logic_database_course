Monoclonal antibodies against human renin. Blood pressure effects in the
marmoset.

The in vivo effects of two anti-human renin monoclonal antibodies with a high
binding affinity for primate renin were studied in conscious, volume-depleted
marmosets. These antibodies, R-3-17-7 and R-3-36-16, both have high binding
activity for renin, but only R-3-36-16 inhibits the enzymatic activity of renin
in vitro. In vivo, R-3-17-7 did not affect blood pressure after intravenous
injection of doses up to 100 micrograms/kg, although plasma renin activity was
partially reduced. In contrast, R-3-36-16 induced a reduction in blood pressure
and an inhibition of plasma renin activity at a threshold dose of 3
micrograms/kg. The maximum fall in blood pressure and complete inhibition of
plasma renin activity were observed after R-3-36-16, 10 micrograms/kg; these
effects persisted for up to 2 hours. Pretreatment with a converting enzyme
inhibitor or nephrectomy prevented the hypotensive effects of R-3-36-16.
Conversely, pretreatment with R-3-36-16 prevented the hypotensive effects of a
converting enzyme inhibitor. These findings indicate that the hypotensive
response induced by R-3-36-16 is due entirely to blockade of the
renin-angiotensin system. Thus, R-3-36-16 appears to be a specific, potent, and
long-acting inhibitor of primate renin. Such monoclonal antibodies provide
interesting tools for studying the effects of acute and chronic renin blockade.

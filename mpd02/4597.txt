Lymphocyte subsets in the young and aging marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).

O'Neill PA, Levy BM.

T lymphocytes were studied in healthy young and old marmosets (Callithrix
jacchus). Data indicate that monoclonal antisera to human T lymphocyte antigens
can be used to identify these cells in marmosets. Total T and suppressor T cells 
were lower in the older group; there were no differences in helper T or in B
cells. Helper/suppressor ratios (T4/T8) were increased in the older group. Thus, 
immune system alternations with aging and/or immune deficiency syndromes may be
studied in this animal model using available reagents.

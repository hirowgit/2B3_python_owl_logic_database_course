The neotropical primate genus Callithrix comprises two groups of species, jacchus
and argentata, which inhabit distinct geographical regions and manifest different
fur coloration and constitutive heterochromatin (CH) markers in their karyotypes.
In this investigation the CH of a representative of the jacchus group, Callithrix
geoffroyi, was analysed using fluorochromes and restriction enzymes in situ. To
clarify the source of the constitutive heterochromatin of both groups, the data
obtained in the jacchus group were compared with those published in the argentata
group obtained by the same techniques. The C-bands of C. geoffroyi (four
specimens, 2n = 46) were centromeric in all chromosomes, and distally located in 
pairs 6 and 22. The Alu I, Hae III, Hin fI, Rsa I, Dde I, Mbo I, and Msp I
restriction endonucleases and CMA3 and DAPI fluorochromes produced different
bands, which allowed the characterization of four distinct types of constitutive 
heterochromatin in the C. geoffroyi genome. Several of these types of
heterochromatin were present in the ancestor of the two groups of species,
jacchus and argentata, while others originated after their cladogenesis.

We used multielectrode arrays to measure the response of populations of neurons
in primate middle temporal area to the transparent motion of two superimposed dot
fields moving in different directions. The shape of the population response was
well predicted by the sum of the responses to the constituent fields. However,
the population response profile for transparent dot fields was similar to that
for coherent plaid motion and hence an unreliable cue to transparency. We then
used single-unit recording to characterize component and pattern cells from their
response to drifting plaids. Unlike for plaids, component cells responded to the 
average direction of superimposed dot fields, whereas pattern cells could signal 
the constituent motions. This observation provides support for a strong
prediction of the Simoncelli and Heeger (1998) model of motion analysis in area
middle temporal, and suggests that pattern cells have a special status in the
processing of superimposed dot fields.

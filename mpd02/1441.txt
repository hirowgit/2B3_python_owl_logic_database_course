The Callithrix jacchus is a Brazilian endemic species that has been widely used
as an experimental model in biomedical research. Anatomical data are necessary to
support experimental studies with this species. Eleven hearts of C. jacchus from 
the German Primate Centre (DPZ) have been studied in order to characterize their 
gross morphometry and compare them with other animal models and human. Biometric 
data were also obtained. The mean values for morphometry of the hearts did not
show any significant difference between male and female. The relative heart
weight was similar to human, bovine and equine species. Considering those
aspects, the C. jacchus could be used as non-human primate experimental model for
biomedical studies on heart.

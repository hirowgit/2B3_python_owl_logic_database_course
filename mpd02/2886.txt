This report provides a brief overview of aspects of training nonhuman primates
who have been, and continue to be, used in this laboratory. The research context 
involves applied behavioral studies in which animals are trained to perform
complex operant behavioral sequences, often in their homecage environment. In
such studies, animals have freedom to choose whether to engage in appetitively
reinforced behavioral tests that employ neither food deprivation nor fluid
management. This background of operant conditioning has provided an insight to,
and a context for, animal training both as an adjunct to general laboratory
management and as a way to expedite scientific procedures. Thus, training has
potential implications for both well-being and scientific quality, although it
must be considered an adjunct to the provision of socialization with conspecifics
in high quality diverse housing systems and not as an alternative to such
provision. The importance of discussion and consideration of alternative
procedures cannot be overemphasized.

17β-HSD1 is a novel target for the treatment of estrogen-dependent diseases, as
it catalyzes intracellular estradiol formation. Starting from two recently
described compounds, highly active and selective inhibitors were developed.
Benzoyl 6 and benzamide 17 are the most selective compounds toward 17β-HSD2
described so far. They also showed a promising profile regarding activity in
T47-D cells, selectivity toward ERα and ERβ, inhibition of hepatic CYP enzymes,
metabolic stability, and inhibition of marmoset 17β-HSD1 and 17β-HSD2.

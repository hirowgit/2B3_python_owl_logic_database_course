Light microscopic histochemical studies to visualize semicarbazide-sensitive and 
H2O2-generating amine oxidase (SSAOX, benzylamine oxidase, BAOX; EC 1.4.3.6?) are
usually performed with the coupled peroxidatic oxidation technique of Ryder et
al. [25]. For methodological reasons this procedure has its limitations and was
therefore replaced by a more reliable and easier to perform cerium-DAB-H2O2-Co
technique. With this method SSAOX was studied in many organs of various
laboratory rodents and marmosets and in human placenta. Independent of the
species the enzyme was present mostly in the plasma membrane of nearly all
vascular and non-vascular smooth muscle cells. However, there was a
species-dependence of SSOX activity; the highest amounts of stain were found in
gerbils and marmosets. In addition, the enzyme was found in these two species in 
the capillary endothelium of some extra-nervous tissues. The plasma membrane
localization of SSAOX and plasma membrane-associated H2O2 production suggest a
functional role for the enzyme different from that of other amine oxidases which 
appear to be primarily involved in intracellular amine detoxification or
degradation.

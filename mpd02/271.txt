There is limited available information concerning the prevalence of Toxoplasma
gondii in noncaptive monkeys. Also, New World monkeys (NWM) are highly
susceptible to toxoplasmosis, which is a conservation concern. This study aimed
to investigate apicomplexan parasites in common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus)
collected for yellow fever and rabies surveillance program in Northeastern region
of Brazil. Heart fragments of 39 free-ranging common marmosets were analyzed for 
the presence of the 18S rDNA gene of apicomplexan parasites by nested PCR.
Positive samples were sequenced. T. gondii DNA was detected in 17.9% (7/39) of
the analyzed animals. This study is the first report on T. gondii in Callithrix
jacchus in Brazil. These findings should be an alert for wildlife conservation
institutions, as high susceptibility and mortality were reported for captive NWM.

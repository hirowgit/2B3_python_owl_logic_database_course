The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a small New World primate that is
native to eastern Brazil and has been used in biomedical research since the early
1960s. Use of this species for research purposes continues to grow at a rapid
pace as they are a viable alternative to other nonhuman primate species. We
discuss clinical care, such as preventative medicine, anesthesia, and routine
clinical procedures. Important viral, bacterial, parasitic, and gastrointestinal 
tract diseases are discussed, with relevant details on cause, transmission,
pathologic changes, diagnosis, and treatment. Current problems affecting marmoset
health and research in the modern vivarium are emphasized.

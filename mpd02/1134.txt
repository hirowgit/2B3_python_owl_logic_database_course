High-resolution metabolomics has created opportunity to integrate nutrition and
metabolism into genetic studies to improve understanding of the diverse radiation
of primate species. At present, however, there is very little information to help
guide experimental design for study of wild populations. In a previous
non-targeted metabolomics study of common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus), Rhesus 
macaques, humans, and four non-primate mammalian species, we found that essential
amino acids (AA) and other central metabolites had interspecies variation similar
to intraspecies variation while non-essential AA, environmental chemicals and
catabolic waste products had greater interspecies variation. The present study
was designed to test whether 55 plasma metabolites, including both nutritionally 
essential and non-essential metabolites and catabolic products, differ in
concentration in common marmosets and humans. Significant differences were
present for more than half of the metabolites analyzed and included AA, vitamins 
and central lipid metabolites, as well as for catabolic products of AA,
nucleotides, energy metabolism and heme. Three environmental chemicals were
present at low nanomolar concentrations but did not differ between species. Sex
and age differences in marmosets were present for AA and nucleotide metabolism
and warrant additional study. Overall, the results suggest that quantitative,
targeted metabolomics can provide a useful complement to non-targeted
metabolomics for studies of diet and environment interactions in primate
evolution.

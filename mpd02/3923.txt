A two-part challenge study was done in marmoset monkeys to confirm the efficacy
of an inactivated hepatitis A vaccine. In part 1 (preexposure), 7 marmosets
received a single low dose of vaccine (360 ELISA units [EL.U.]) and were
challenged orally with wild type hepatitis A virus (HAV) either 1 or 6 months
later. In part 2 (postexposure), 8 marmosets were challenged orally with HAV and 
then half each were inoculated with a single dose of 360 or 1440 EL.U. of vaccine
2 days later. The suboptimal immune response elicited by the low vaccine dose in 
the preexposure group was sufficient to induce complete protection against oral
challenge with heterologous HAV in all marmosets that had responded
serologically. In the postexposure group, the 360-EL.U. dose of vaccine resulted 
in partial protection against hepatitis A disease, whereas the 1440-EL.U. dose of
vaccine elicited complete protection against disease and virus excretion.

We measured the spatial receptive field dimensions of cells in the lateral
geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) using a
bipartite field stimulus in which the two halves of the field were modulated
identically but in counterphase. Horizontal and vertical edges between the two
fields were positioned at different locations in the receptive field. By assuming
that centers and surrounds have gaussian profiles, we were able to obtain a
satisfactory mathematical description of the data. Receptive field centers were
about a factor 1.6 larger than those of macaque LGN cells, in accordance with the
smaller marmoset eye. There was a limited correspondence with dendritic tree
dimensions of marmoset retinal ganglion cells. We further found that center and
surround gaussians were not always concentric, and that the centers of some cells
were elongated. This might allow some direction or orientation biases in LGN
cells.

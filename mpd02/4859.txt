Marmoset evolution: the molecular evidence.

Cronin JE, Sarich VM.

We report here the results of comparative immunological and electrophoretic
studies of the serum proteins of the New World monkeys. Specifically, we find
that the New World monkeys share a long period of common ancestry with the
Catarrhini and that the divergence between these two groups occurred some 35-40
million years ago. The extant New World monkey lineages are then seen as sharing 
a long period of common ancestry subsequent to that divergence, with their
radiation beginning in the early Miocene. We see seven distinct lineages stemming
from this radiation: (1) Aotus, (2) Callicebus, (3) Cebus, (4) Saimiri, (5)
Ateles-Lagothrix-Alouatta, (6) Pithecia-Cacajao and (7) Callimico-Callimico with 
Cebuella-Saguinus-Leontideus. Within those Ateles with Lagonthrix, and Callimico 
with Callithrix-Cebuella form further subgroups. The marmoset radiation appears
to have begun some 7-10 million years ago.

Lymphocytes from chimeric individuals of the species Callithrix jacchus
(Primates) were examined to evaluate differences in the frequency of sister
chromatid exchanges (SCE) between XX and XY cells. The aim was to discover
whether SCE differ according to genetic sex and whether XX and XY cells show a
different sensitivity to SCE inducing agents. This experimental model has enabled
us to eliminate the possible differences caused by environmental factors. The
results obtained do not reveal significant differences between male and female
cells, in either the baseline SCE frequency or that induced by mitomycin C at
concentrations of 0.01 and 0.03 microgram/ml. No significant differences were
observed in the distribution of high SCE frequency cells (HFC), even if it is
possible to observe a higher level of exchanges in XX cells in each trial. With
regard to the phenotypic sex, there appears to be a trend towards slightly higher
SCE rates in females, even if results are not statistically significant.

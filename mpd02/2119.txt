This study proposes new developmental stages for Callithrix jacchus, using
K-Means algorithm and an artificial neural network-self-organising maps (SOM) as 
computational tools, based on weight and age. Eight developmental stages are
proposed: Infant I, II and III, Juvenile I and II, Sub adult, Young adult and
Older adult. This classification is consistent with the first appearance of
several behavioural and physiological characteristics and thus may have
generality in defining critical developmental periods. It also reveals
differences in male and female development and establishes a stage for the onset 
of the final adult life cycle. This classification is also important to
understanding the biology of the ontogenetic development of common marmosets,
providing new insights for the management and care of captive animals and
improving age estimate indicators when specimens are captured in long term
monitoring of free ranging groups.

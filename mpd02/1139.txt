Spermatogonia are specialized cells responsible for continuous spermatogenesis
and the production of offspring. Because of this biological property, in vitro
culture of spermatogonia provides a powerful methodology to advance reproductive 
biology and engineering. However, methods for culturing primate spermatogonia are
poorly established. We have designed a novel method for culturing spermatogonia
in the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a small primate. By using our method
with a suite of growth factors, adult marmoset testis-derived germ cells could be
cultured in the form of a floating sphere for several weeks. Notably, this method
could be applied not only to freshly isolated cells but also to cryopreserved
cell stocks. The spheres enriched spermatogonia and early spermatocytes, and
could be assembled from a C-KIT(+) spermatogonial population. Techniques for
culturing spermatogonia could facilitate increased understanding of primate
reproduction as well as the preservation of valuable biomaterials from nonhuman
primates.

Cerebral beta-amyloid occurs in elderly animals of some species and in
Alzheimer's disease. Previously, we injected 3 young marmosets intracerebrally
with brain tissue from a patient with Alzheimer's disease. Six years later, when 
the monkeys were middle aged, we found moderate numbers of intracerebral plaques 
and cerebrovascular deposits containing beta-amyloid. We have re-examined these
brains and those of 10 other marmosets injected with brain homogenate containing 
beta-amyloid, and have found some beta-amyloid in animals injected more than 4
years previously. We have found beta-amyloid in 4 of 26 elderly control
marmosets, but not in 9 young to middle-aged control marmosets. The beta-amyloid 
found in middle aged marmosets injected with Alzheimer brain tissue was,
therefore, not a consequence of their age. Deposits in large cerebral vessels in 
elderly marmosets, and in marmosets previously injected with brain tissue
containing beta-amyloid, reacted with antibodies to Abeta and Abeta1-40; plaques 
and microvessel deposits reacted with antibodies to Abeta and Abeta1-42.

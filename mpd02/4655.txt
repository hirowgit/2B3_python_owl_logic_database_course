[Morphologic findings in experimental non-A, non-B hepatitis].

[Article in German]

Dienes HP.

A report is given about light and electron microscopy in primates with
experimental hepatitis non-A-non-B; own data are presented as well as data from
the literature. Morphological changes after infection with GB, NANB and Delta-AG 
are discussed. Light microscopy in these animal models shows a similar pattern of
lesions as can be found in human hepatitis; however, in these models
ultrastructural changes have been observed, whose specifity has not yet been
confirmed.

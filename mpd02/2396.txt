A slowly growing microaerophilic Helicobacter species was isolated from the feces
of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). This bacterium possessed a pair of
nonsheathed bipolar flagella, was positive for oxidase, catalase and alkaline
phosphatase activities, but was negative for gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase and
urease activity and for nitrate reduction. The bacterium was susceptible to
nalidixic acid and resistant to cephalotine and did not hydrolyze hippurate. On
the basis of phenotypic characteristics, 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis and
whole-cell protein profiles, the isolate represents a new species of the genus
Helicobacter, for which the name Helicobacter callitrichis sp. nov. is proposed; 
the type strain of the new species is R-204(T) (GenBank accession number
AY192526).

The measurement of ethylenethiourea and ethyleneurea in the rat and common
marmoset Callithrix jacchus after zineb (zinc ethylenebisdithiocarbamate) dosing.

Searle AJ, Stewart AC, Paul M.

The metabolism of the fungicide zineb, (zinc ethylenebisdithiocarbamate), has
been studied in the rat and the marmoset. 2. It was found in both species that a 
relatively large proportion (21-22%) of the original zineb administered was
detectable in the excreta as ethylenethiourea (ETU) a known mutagen, teratogen
and carcinogen. 3. A further proportion (2-5%) was determined to be ethyleneurea 
which is a metabolite of ETU. 4. Results of comparative experiments in marmosets 
revealed that ETU was photolabile in the presence of excreta, thus showing the
importance of conducting the studies in the dark.

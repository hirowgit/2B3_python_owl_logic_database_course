This study used Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) to identify potential
neurometabolitic markers of cognitive performance in male (n = 7) and female
(n = 8) middle-aged (∼5 years old) common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus).
Anesthetized marmosets were scanned with a 4.7 T/40 cm horizontal magnet equipped
with 450 mT/m magnetic field gradients and a 20 G/cm magnetic field gradient
insert, within 3 months of completing the CANTAB serial Reversal Learning task.
Neurometabolite concentrations of N-Acetyl Asparate, Myo-Inositol, Choline,
Phosphocreatine + creatine, Glutamate and Glutamine were acquired from a 3 mm3
voxel positioned in the Prefrontal Cortex (PFC). Males acquired the reversals
(but not simple discriminations) faster than the females. Higher PFC Glx
(glutamate + glutamine) concentration was associated with faster acquisition of
the reversals. Interestingly, the correlation between cognitive performance and
Glx was significant in males, but not in females. These results suggest that MRS 
is a useful tool to identify biochemical markers of cognitive performance in the 
healthy nonhuman primate brain and that biological sex modulates the relationship
between neurochemical composition and cognition.

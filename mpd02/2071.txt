We describe a flexible wireless neural recording system, which is comprised of a 
15-channel analog FM transmitter, digital receiver and custom user interface
software for data acquisition. The analog front-end is constructed from
commercial off the shelf (COTS) components and weighs 6.3g (including batteries) 
and is capable of transmitting over 24 hours up to a range over 3m with a
25microV(rms) in-vivo noise floor. The Software Defined Radio (SDR) and the
acquisition software provide a data acquisition platform with real time data
display and can be customized based on the specifications of various experiments.
The described system was characterized with in-vitro and in-vivo experiments and 
the results are presented.

Glucocorticoids applied prenatally alter birth weight and the maturation of the
lungs. Moreover, glucocorticoids impair neuronal proliferation and
differentiation in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. In the present study
proliferation and neuronal differentiation in the dentate gyrus were studied in
newborn common marmoset monkeys which were intrauterinely exposed to the
synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone (DEX). Pregnant marmoset monkeys received 
DEX (5 mg/kg body weight) daily either during early (days 42-48) or late (days
90-96) pregnancy. In the hippocampi of newborn monkeys immunohistochemistry was
performed with markers of proliferation (Ki-67), apoptosis (in situ tailing) as
well as early and late neuronal differentiation (calretinin and calbindin). Both 
after early and late intrauterine exposure to DEX, proliferation of dentate gyrus
cells was significantly decreased (P < 0.05). The density of apoptotic neurons
was not altered by DEX treatment. Quantification of calretinin- and
calbindin-immunoreactive neurons showed no significant differences between
DEX-exposed and control animals. In conclusion, the proliferation of putative
precursor cells but not the differentiation into mature cells was impaired in the
dentate gyrus of newborn marmosets exposed intrauterinely to DEX.

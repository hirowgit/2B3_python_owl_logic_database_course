The structure and evolution of the SEC1 gene were examined for the first time in 
New World primates of the genera Alouatta, Aotus, Ateles, Brachyteles,
Callicebus, Callithrix, Cebus, Chiropotes, Lagothrix, Leontopithecus, Pithecia,
Saguinus, and Saimiri. This gene has a high CG content (63.8%) and an estimated
heterogeneous size ranging from 795 (Callithrix) to 1041 bp (Pithecia), due to
numerous indel events. Similar to other fucosyltransferases, three conserved
regions are shared by these primates, except for the callitrichines, Aotus and
Pithecia, in which indel events resulted in premature stop codons that are
related to the production of a supposedly non-functional protein. Phylogenetic
analysis of the SEC1 gene, transition/transversion rates, and nucleotide sequence
alignment support the hypothesis that primate SEC1 evolved by divergent
evolution, and that the lack of activity in some lineages occurred independently 
at least twice in New World primates, once in the Aotus-Cebus-Callitrichinae
group and again in Pithecia. Likelihood-based inference of ancestral states for
the activity of SEC1 leads us to suppose that inactivation of SEC1 in the
Callitrichinae was a result of a more complex series of events than in Pithecia.

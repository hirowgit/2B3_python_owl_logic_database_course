Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is a global health concern that is associated
with significant morbidity and is a major cause of infertility. Throughout
history animals have been used for anatomical studies and later as models of
human disease. In particular, nonhuman primates (NHPs) have permitted
investigations of human disease in a biologically, physiologically, and
anatomically similar system. The use of NHPs as human PID models has led to a
greater understanding of the primary microorganisms that cause disease (e.g.,
Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorroheae), the pathogenesis of infection
and its complications, and the treatment of people with PID. This paper explores 
historical and contemporary aspects of NHP modeling of chlamydial PID, with an
emphasis on advantages and limitations of this approach and future directions for
this research.

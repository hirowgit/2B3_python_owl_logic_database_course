Reduced expression of dyskinesia is observed in levodopa-primed MPTP-treated
common marmosets when dopamine agonists are used to replace levodopa. We now
investigate whether a combination of the D-2/D-3 agonist pramipexole and levodopa
also reduces dyskinesia intensity while maintaining the reversal of motor
disability. Drug na√Øve, non-dyskinetic MPTP-treated common marmosets were treated
daily for up to 62 days with levodopa (12.5 mg/kg plus carbidopa 12.5 mg/kg p.o. 
BID) or pramipexole (0.04-0.3 mg/kg BID) producing equivalent reversal of motor
disability and increases in locomotor activity. Levodopa alone resulted in marked
dyskinesia induction but little or no dyskinesia resulted from the administration
of pramipexole. From day 36, some animals were treated with a combination of
levodopa (3.125-6.25 mg/kg plus carbidopa 12.5 mg/kg p.o. BID) and pramipexole
(0.1-0.2 mg/kg p.o. SID). This improved motor disability to a greater extent than
occurred with levodopa alone. Importantly, while dyskinesia was greater than that
produced by pramipexole alone, the combination resulted in less intense
dyskinesia than produced by levodopa alone. These results suggest that
pramipexole could be administered with a reduced dose of levodopa to minimize
dyskinesia in Parkinson's disease while maintaining therapeutic efficacy.

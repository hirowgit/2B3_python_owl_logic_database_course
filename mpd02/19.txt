An increase in number of neurons is presumed to underlie the enhancement of
cognitive abilities in brain evolution. The evolution of human cognition is then 
expected to have accompanied a prolongation of net neural-processing time due to 
the accumulation of processing time of individual neurons over an expanded number
of neurons. Here, we confirmed this prediction and quantified the amount of
prolongation in vivo, using noninvasive measurements of brain responses to sounds
in unanesthetized human and nonhuman primates. Latencies of the N1 component of
auditory-evoked potentials recorded from the scalp were approximately 40, 50, 60,
and 100 ms for the common marmoset, rhesus monkey, chimpanzee, and human,
respectively. Importantly, the prominent increase in human N1 latency could not
be explained by the physical lengthening of the auditory pathway, and therefore
reflected an extended dwell time for auditory cortical processing. A longer time 
window for auditory cortical processing is advantageous for analyzing
time-varying acoustic stimuli, such as those important for speech perception. A
novel hypothesis concerning human brain evolution then emerges: the increase in
cortical neuronal number widened the timescale of sensory cortical processing,
the benefits of which outweighed the disadvantage of slow cognition and reaction.

The effects of bifemelane on parkinsonism were shown in MPTP-treated common
marmosets. The administration of bifemelane increased locomotor activity in
MPTP-treated marmosets but not in normal control marmosets. In a microdialysis
study, extracellular levels of dopamine and its metabolites increased following
the administration of bifemelane. These results indicate that it is worth
studying the effects of bifemelane hydrochloride on patients with Parkinson's
disease.

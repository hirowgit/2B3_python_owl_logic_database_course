Protracted long-term treatment of common marmosets with 15 doses (0.5-4.5 mg/kg, 
i.p.) of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP; total dose 25 mg/kg,
given over 29 days) caused transitory changes in motor behaviour reminiscent of
human Parkinson's disease. 16 days from the start of MPTP administration, all
animals showed motor impairment, consisting of profound akinesia and a rigid
posture, but in no case resting tremor. Biogenic amines were measured in
nigrostriatal regions one month after finishing MPTP treatment. There was a
profound loss of dopamine and serotonin in the substantia nigra and in the
striatum; noradrenaline was only reduced in the putamen. Continuous analyses of
the concentrations of biogenic amine metabolites in the CSF during this study
revealed persistent dopaminergic disturbances and temporary alterations in
serotoninergic and noradrenergic function.

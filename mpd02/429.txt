An increasing number of studies suggest that olfaction is important for
communication throughout the order of primates. Callitrichids, in particular,
have well-developed olfactory systems and use anogenital glands to produce scent 
marks. Behavioural studies have shown that male common marmosets (Callithrix
jacchus) distinguish between odours from the peri-ovulatory and luteal phase of
females. However, large gaps remain in understanding the chemical underpinnings
of olfactory cues. To investigate whether chemical cues vary with female
fertility and reproductive quality, our study combined behavioural bioassays with
chemical analyses of the anogenital odours of female common marmosets using gas
chromatography-mass spectrometry. We found that cycle states, age and parity have
an impact on chemical profiles and further identified affected chemical
substances. Our results confirm and expand on previous behavioural evidence for
cues of fertility. Our results indicate that cycle-related substances likely act 
as chemical cues. Males could use such olfactory fertility cues to optimize their
mating effort and thereby increase their paternity certainty. This certainty
could enhance paternal care for their infants. The results of our study open a
promising avenue to find the metabolic pathways from which chemical cues of
fertility arise and to unravel their importance during primate evolution in
future comparative studies.

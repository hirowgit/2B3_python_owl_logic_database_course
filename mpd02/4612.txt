Plasmodium brasilianum in the common marmoset Callithrix jacchus.

Wedderburn N, Mitchell GH, Davies DR.

Chronic quartan malarial infection has been established in the common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus). Plasmodium brasilianum from a douroucouli monkey (Aotus
trivirgatus) was used to infect splenectomized twin animals, passed to an intact 
animal, and then to 4 other intact adults, 2 pairs of twins. In 2 of the 4 latter
animals there was continuing patency with parasitaemias of less than or equal to 
0.5% parasitized erythrocytes for 30 weeks. The other 2 had lower initial levels 
of parasitaemia; in 1 of these parasitaemias remained low or subpatent. All
marmosets developed lymphocytosis. One animal became ill 30 weeks after infection
with anaemia, weight loss and mild proteinurea, the other 3 remained well.
Histological examination showed minor changes in the kidneys; spleens of infected
animals showed marked follicular hyperplasia and phagocytosis of pigment. The
livers showed sinusoidal hypercellularity and pigment deposition and in
splenectomized animals, a marked lymphoid follicular hyperplasia in the portal
tracts.

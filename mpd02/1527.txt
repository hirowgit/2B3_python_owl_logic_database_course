The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a small-bodied Neotropical primate
and a useful preclinical animal model for translational research into
autoimmune-mediated inflammatory diseases (AIMID), such as rheumatoid arthritis
(RA) and multiple sclerosis (MS). The animal model for MS established in
marmosets has proven their value for exploratory research into (etio) pathogenic 
mechanisms and for the evaluation of new therapies that cannot be tested in lower
species because of their specificity for humans. Effective usage of the marmoset 
in preclinical immunological research has been hampered by the limited
availability of blood for immunological studies and of reagents for profiling of 
cellular and humoral immune reactions. In this paper, we give a concise overview 
of the procedures and reagents that were developed over the years in our
laboratory in marmoset models of the above-mentioned diseases.

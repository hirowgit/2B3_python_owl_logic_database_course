BACKGROUND: Embryonic stem cells (ESC) hold great promise for the treatment of
degenerative diseases. However, before clinical application of ESC in cell
replacement therapy can be achieved, the safety and feasibility must be
extensively tested in animal models. The common marmoset monkey (Callithrix
jacchus) is a useful preclinical non-human primate model due to its physiological
similarities to human. Yet, few marmoset ESC lines exist and differences in their
developmental potential remain unclear.
METHODS: Blastocysts were collected and immunosurgery was performed. cjes001
cells were tested for euploidy by karyotyping. The presence of markers for
pluripotency was confirmed by immunofluorescence staining and RT-PCR. Histology
of teratoma, in vitro differentiation and embryoid body formation revealed the
differentiation potential.
RESULTS: cjes001 cells displayed a normal 46,XX karyotype. Alkaline phosphatase
activity, expression of telomerase and the transcription factors OCT4, NANOG and 
SOX2 as well as the presence of stage-specific embryonic antigen (SSEA)-3,
SSEA-4, tumor rejection antigens (TRA)-1-60, and TRA-1-81 indicated pluripotency.
Teratoma formation assay displayed derivatives of all three embryonic germ
layers. Upon non-directed differentiation, the cells expressed the germ cell
markers VASA, BOULE, germ cell nuclear factor and synaptonemal complex protein 3 
and showed co-localization of VASA protein within individual cells with the germ 
line stem cell markers CD9, CD49f, SSEA-4 and protein gene product 9.5,
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The cjes001 cells represent a new pluripotent ESC line with evidence
for enhanced spontaneous differentiation potential into germ cells. This cjes001 
line will be very valuable for comparative studies on primate ESC biology.

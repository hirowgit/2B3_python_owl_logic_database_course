The study of personality in animals is a rapidly growing scientific field and
numerous species have been reported to show consistent personality profiles. Much
animal personality research has focused on nonhuman primates, with the main
emphasis being placed on Old World primates, particularly rhesus macaques and
chimpanzees. So far, little work has been done on cooperatively breeding nonhuman
primates and New World species. Here, we study personality in the cooperatively
breeding common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) to broaden the taxonomic range of 
such research and to widen the perspective of comparative personality research.
We use behavioral data collection and observer trait ratings to assess marmoset
personality dimensions. The resulting behavioral and rating-derived personality
dimensions, when viewed in tandem, resemble the human five-factor model and
include extraversion, agreeableness, neuroticism, openness, and
conscientiousness. Correlations between the behavioral data and the observer
trait-rated personality components suggest that the personality construct of
common marmosets exhibits both convergent and discriminant validity. The finding 
of a distinct Conscientiousness component in this species extends previous
knowledge in comparative personality psychology and warrants reconsideration of
proposed taxonomic trait distributions.

Marmosets are cooperative breeders organized as extended family groups, but
breeding is generally restricted to a single pair. Breeding competition is fierce
in female marmosets; males, on the other hand, show low levels of intragroup
aggression. We investigated male and female breeding strategies and the resulting
reproductive output in 9 wild groups. Reproductive output, tenure of breeding
animals, identification of the breeding system, breeding position replacements,
migration and infanticide were recorded; also, we recorded grooming and
aggression. Replacement of the breeding male or female was observed on nine
occasions. On four occasions, the son of the breeding male inherited the breeding
post, but we never observed inheritance of a breeding post by a daughter. Mostly,
females attained a breeding post by immigrating to a group that had a breeding
vacancy. Our results showed that Callithrix jacchus males and females use
different strategies to attain a breeding position and maintain it for as long as
possible. These strategies prolong the tenure of the breeding position, which is 
the best way to produce a large number of offspring. This article is part of a
Special Issue entitled: Neotropical Behaviour.

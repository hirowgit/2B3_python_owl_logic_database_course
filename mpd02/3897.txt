The sequences of the blue cone photopigments in the talapoin monkey (Miopithecus 
talapoin), an Old World primate, and in the marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a New 
World monkey, are presented. Both genes are composed of 5 exons separated by 4
introns. In this respect, they are identical to the human blue gene, and intron
sizes are also similar. Based on the level of amino acid identity, both monkey
pigments are members of the S branch of pigments. Alignment of these sequences
with the human gene requires the insertion/deletion of two separate codons in
exon 1. The silent site divergence between these primate blue genes indicates a
separation of the Old and New World primate lineages around 43 million years ago.

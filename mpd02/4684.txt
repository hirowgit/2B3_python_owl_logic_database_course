The survival rate for offspring of mothers who either had or did not have
previous experience rearing younger siblings was compared in two callitrichid
species, Callithrix jacchus and Saguinus oedipus. Offspring of mothers with
sibling-rearing experience had a higher survival percentage than offspring of
inexperienced mothers in both species. While 50-60% of offspring of inexperienced
C. jacchus mothers survived, no offspring of inexperienced S. oedipus mothers
survived. The results suggest that sibling-rearing experience is necessary for
adequate maternal behavior in S. oedipus, but not necessary to the development of
maternal behavior in C. jacchus. Effects of previous sibling-rearing experience
of S. oedipus fathers on offspring survival were also examined. Whether the
father had rearing experience was not related to the survival of their offspring.

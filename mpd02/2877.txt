We showed previously that hepatic vitamin A concentrations of captive rhesus
monkeys (Macaca mulatta) are subtoxic to toxic, with livers exhibiting stellate
cell hypertrophy and hyperplasia. Although marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) livers
are also high in vitamin A, no stellate cell irregularities were observed. To
further characterize the effects of high dietary vitamin A from preformed
sources, stored serum samples were analyzed from monkeys used for biomedical
research and housed at the Wisconsin Primate Research Center. The monkeys had
been fed commercially available monkey diets, providing vitamin A (as retinyl
acetate) at levels exceeding NRC recommendations by a factor of four. The serum
from both rhesus and marmoset monkeys had total serum vitamin A (retinol, retinyl
esters and metabolites) within the expected range for both species, i.e., 1.44
+/- 0.34 and 1.41 +/- 0.72 micromol/L serum for rhesus and marmoset monkeys,
respectively. However, high serum retinyl ester concentrations as a percentage of
total serum vitamin A were present in both species, 12 +/- 5.1% (range, 5.5-23%) 
for rhesus and 27 +/- 14% (range, 10-57%) for the marmosets. Serum retinol
concentrations were normal, i.e., 1.21 +/- 0.28 (rhesus) and 0.92 +/- 0.43
micromol/L (marmoset), compared with published values.

Although reports on colony demographics for a variety of callitrichid species are
available in the literature, to date there has not been a detailed examination of
Wied's black tufted-ear marmoset (Callithrix kuhlii). The purpose of this study
is to present colony demographics for C. kuhlii from the University of Nebraska
at Omaha's Callitrichid Research Center from 1991 to 2002. C. kuhlii are
currently held in a number of zoological parks in the United States and abroad;
however, the University of Nebraska at Omaha held the only breeding colony in
North America. Here we report data on lifespan, sex ratio, litter size, and
interbirth interval (IBI) for that captive breeding colony.

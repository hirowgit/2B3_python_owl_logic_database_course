We determined the amylase levels in serum samples from six callitrichid species. 
The normal serum amylase values for all of these species was within or higher
than the normal human range. Amylase values higher than the normal range occurred
not only in association with pancreatitis but also pyometra, bone fracture,
abscesses, diabetes mellitus and gastrointestinal conditions leading to diarrhea.
We concluded that although serum amylase activity may be helpful in diagnosing
pancreatitis, it is, as in humans, not specific for this condition in
callitrichids.

MD-3 is a novel anti-human ICAM-1 monoclonal antibody that induces T cell
tolerance in humanized mice via modulation of dendritic cell differentiation and 
efficiently suppresses the development of collagen-induced arthritis. This effect
has also been observed in xenograft rejection in nonhuman primates, where grafts 
survived for more than 2.5 years following MD-3 administration. Here, we show
that MD-3 can attenuate experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) that was 
induced in common marmoset monkeys by immunization with human myelin
oligodendrocyte glycoproteins. MD-3 administration was initiated 1 week after
immunization and efficiently delayed the development of EAE phenotypes, although 
the disease was not completely prevented. Based on the results of
histopathological examination, MD-3 treatment greatly suppressed total
inflammation with respect to demyelination, as well as T cell and microglial
infiltration in the brain. However, the antibody response against myelin
oligodendrocyte glycoprotein was not suppressed with this treatment protocol.
These observations suggest that the MD-3 antibody has beneficial effects on the
treatment of EAE via the suppression of T cell-mediated cellular responses.

Moderate numbers of amyloid plaques with associated argyrophilic dystrophic
neurites and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) but no neurofibrillary tangles
(NFTs) were found in the brains of 3 middle-aged common marmosets (Callithrix
jacchus) inoculated intracerebrally (i.c.) 6-7 years earlier with brain tissue
from a patient with early onset Alzheimer's disease. The plaques and vascular
amyloid stained positively with antibodies to beta (A4)-protein. The brains of 3 
age-matched control marmosets from the same colony did not show these
neuropathological features. beta-amyloid plaques and CAA (but no spongiform
encephalopathy) were also found in the brain of a marmoset inoculated with brain 
tissue from a patient with prion disease with concomitant beta-amyloid plaques
and CAA. An occasional beta-amyloid plaque was found in the brains of two
marmosets inoculated with brain tissue from elderly patients. No beta-amyloid
plaques nor CAA were found in 6 other marmosets who were older than the
inoculated marmosets, 10 further marmosets who were slightly younger but who had 
been inoculated several years previously with brain tissue which did not contain 
beta-amyloid, and 10 younger marmosets who had been subjected to various
neurosurgical procedures. These results suggest that beta-amyloidosis is a
transmissible process.

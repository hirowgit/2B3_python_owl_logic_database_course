The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a New World monkey, is emerging as a
promising animal model for biomedical and neuroscience research. This species
shares its basic brain architecture, including the organization of the motor
cortical areas and the connections between these and other areas, with humans and
other primates. Its small and lissencephalic cerebral cortex is suitable for the 
application of modern biological techniques. Optogenetic stimulation of the motor
cortex induces forelimb movements, and two-photon calcium imaging allows
detection of forelimb movement-related activity in multiple motor cortical
neurons. The common marmoset also has a large repertoire of forelimb-related
behaviors and vocal communications. Thus, the common marmoset is a good model for
research into voluntary forelimb movements, social behaviors, and their
dysfunctions.

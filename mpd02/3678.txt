This study describes differences between guinea pig and rat in the
immunoreactivities for calbindin (CB-IR) and parvalbumin (PV-IR) in cartwheel
(CWC) and Purkinje-like (PLC) cells of the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN). CWCs
are the most important inhibitory interneurons of the DCN. Their soma and
dendrites stain intensely for CB-IR in guinea pigs but only weakly and
incompletely in rats. In both species, the CWCs do not show PV-IR. PLCs, a rare
type of DCN cells often interpreted as displaced cerebellar Purkinje cells
misrouted during migration, are known from rat and mouse and are here described
for guinea pig DCN. PLCs are intensely and completely stained for CB-IR and PV-IR
in guinea pigs. In rats, they stain with similar completeness only for CB-IR,
PV-IR being weak and restricted to the cell's soma. Similar staining differences 
between the two species are seen with the cerebellar Purkinje cells, i.e., PLCs
resemble the cerebellar Purkinje cells more than do the CWCs. Based on the
present material (and preliminary findings in a primate (marmoset), we speculate 
that the PLCs have their place in the circuitry of the DCN receiving input via
parallel fibers, like the CWCs, and possibly projecting their axon onto the
cerebellum.

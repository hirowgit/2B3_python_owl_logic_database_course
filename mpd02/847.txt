Hemoplasmas, the erythrocyte-associated mycoplasmas, have been detected in
several primates, causing mostly subclinical infection. This study aimed to
determine the prevalence of hemoplasma infection in captive and free-ranging
monkeys from southern Brazil, as well as factors and hematological abnormalities 
associated with infection. Blood samples from 40 non-human primates (NHP) were
tested for hemoplasmas and coinfections. An overall of 10/40 (25.0%) NHP tested
positive for hemoplasmas using PCR-based assays, including 9/14 (64.3%) black
howler monkeys (Alouatta caraya) and 1/24 (4.2%) black-horned capuchin (Sapajus
nigritus). Infection was not statistically associated with anemia, but wild-born 
monkeys and male black howler monkeys were more likely to be positive when
compared with captive-born animals and female black howler monkeys, respectively.
The sequences from the black howler monkey hemoplasma were similar (94% identity)
to the squirrel monkey hemoplasma ("Candidatus Mycoplasma kahanei") and were
phylogenetically located in a different cluster when compared to the human
hemoplasma ("Candidatus Mycoplasma haemohominis").

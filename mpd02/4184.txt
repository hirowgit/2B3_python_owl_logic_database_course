An experimental study undertaken in the marmoset is reported. A defect in the
lateral cord of the brachial plexus was repaired with a longitudinally aligned
freeze-thawed skeletal muscle autograft. Recovery was assessed after one year
using sensory and motor electrophysiological and also histological examination of
the nerve. The results show that this is a satisfactory method of peripheral
nerve repair in the marmoset. It is suggested that the technique may be
applicable to repair of the human brachial plexus.

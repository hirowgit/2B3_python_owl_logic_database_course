Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) hold enormous potential for the
development of cell-based therapies; however, the safety and efficacy of
potential iPSC-based treatments need to be verified in relevant animal disease
models before their application in the clinic. Here, we report the derivation of 
iPSCs from common marmoset monkeys (Callithrix jacchus) using self-replicating
mRNA vectors based on the Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEE-mRNAs). By
transfection of marmoset fibroblasts with VEE-mRNAs carrying the human OCT4,
KLF4, SOX2, and c-MYC and culture in the presence of small molecule inhibitors
CHIR99021 and SB431542, we first established intermediate primary colonies with
neural progenitor-like properties. In the second reprogramming step, we converted
these colonies into transgene-free pluripotent stem cells by further culturing
them with customized marmoset iPSC medium in feeder-free conditions. Our
experiments revealed a novel paradigm for flexible reprogramming of somatic
cells, where primary colonies obtained by a single VEE-mRNA transfection can be
directed either toward the neural lineage or further reprogrammed to
pluripotency. These results (1) will further enhance the role of the common
marmoset as animal disease model for preclinical testing of iPSC-based therapies 
and (2) establish an in vitro system to experimentally address developmental
signal transduction pathways in primates.

A series of 5-phenyl-3-ureidobenzodiazepine-2,4-diones was synthesized and
evaluated as cholecystokinin-B (CCK-B) receptor antagonists. Structure-activity
relationship (SAR) studies revealed the importance of the N-1 substituent for
potent and selective CCK-B affinity. Addition of substituents at the urea side
chain provided in some cases more potent compounds. Moreover the introduction of 
bulky substituents such as adamantylmethyl at N-1 and resolution of the racemic
ureas resulted in our lead compound GV150013.

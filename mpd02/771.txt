Experimental intranasal infection of marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) with calpox
virus results in fatal disease. Route and dose used for viral inoculation of the 
test animals mimics the natural transmission of smallpox, thus representing a
suitable model to study pathogenesis and to evaluate new vaccines against
orthopoxvirus infection. However, the pathogenic mechanisms leading to death are 
still unclear. Therefore, our study aimed at investigating the kinetics of
pathological alterations to clarify the pathogenesis in calpox virus infection.
Following intranasal inoculation with two different viral doses, common marmosets
were sacrificed on days 3, 5, 7, 10 and 12 post inoculation. Collected tissue was
screened using histopathology, immunohistochemistry, transmission electron
microscopy, and virological assays. Our data suggest that primary replication
took place in nasal and bronchial epithelia followed by secondary replication in 
submandibular lymph nodes and spleen. Parallel to viremia at day 7, virus was
detectable in many organs, mainly located in epithelial cells and macrophages, as
well as in endothelial cells. Based on the onset of clinical signs, the
histological and ultrastructural lesions and the immunohistochemical distribution
pattern of the virus, the incubation period was defined to last 11 days, which
resembles human smallpox. In conclusion, the data indicate that the calpox model 
is highly suitable for studying orthopoxvirus-induced disease.

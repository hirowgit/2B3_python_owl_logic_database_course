A major outbreak of yellow fever (YF) occurred in Brazil during 2016-2018.
Epizootics in New World nonhuman primates are sentinel events for YF virus
circulation. However, genus-specific susceptibilities and suitability for YF
surveillance remain poorly understood. We obtained and compared epidemiologic,
histopathologic, immunohistochemical, and molecular results from 93 human and
1,752 primate cases submitted during the recent YF outbreak in Brazil (2017),
with the support of the Brazilian National YF Surveillance Program. We detected
heterogeneous YF-associated profiles among the various genera of primates we
analyzed. Alouatta primates were the most reliable sentinel; Sapajus and
Callicebus primates had higher viral loads but lower proportional mortality
rates. Callithrix primates were the least sensitive, showing lower viral loads,
lower proportional mortality rates, and no demonstrable YF virus antigen or
extensive lesions in liver, despite detectable viral RNA. These differences in
susceptibility, viral load, and mortality rates should be considered in strategic
surveillance of epizootics and control measures for YF.

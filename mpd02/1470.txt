Although the murine models have the feasibility to reproduce some signs of dengue
Virus (DENV) infection, the use of isogenic hosts with polarized immune response 
patterns does not reproduce the particularities of human disease. Our goal was to
investigate the kinetics of peripheral blood biomarkers in immunocompetent
Callithrix penicillata non-human primates subcutaneously infected with DENV-3.
The viral load of infected animals was determinated by quantitative real time
PCR. Measurements of DENV-3/IgM were performed, and several parameters were
assessed by hemogram: red blood cells count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, white blood 
cells count, neutrophils, monocytes, lymphocytes, and platelets count. The
coagulogram was performed by prothrombin time (PT), and activated partial
thromboplastin time (APTT) assays. The renal function was monitored by urea and
creatinine, and the liver function by the aspartate (AST), and alanine (ALT)
aminotransferases. Also, the level of the cytokines IL-6, TNF-α, IL-2, IFN-γ,
IL-4 and IL-5 was quantified during the experimental study. Data analysis was
performed considering relevant differences when baseline fold changes were found 
outside from 0.75 to 1.5 range. Our data demonstrated that infected animals
presented relevant signs of dengue disease, including peaks of viremia at 5
days-post-infection (dpi), peaks of anti-DENV-3 IgM at 15 dpi and hemaglutination
inhibition assay (HIA) from 15 to at 60 dpi. Despite early monocytosis, slight
neutrophilia and lymphocytosis, animals developed persistent leucopenia starting 
at 4 dpi. Anemia episodes were steady at 3-4 dpi. Patent thrombocytopenia was
observed from 1 to 15 dpi with sporadic decrease of APTT. A substantial increase 
of ALT and AST was observed with higher peak at 4 dpi. Moreover, early increases 
of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma besides late increase of IFN-gamma were observed. The 
analysis of biomarkers network pointed out two relevant strong axes during early 
stages of dengue fever, a protective axes TNF-alpha/Lymphocytes/Platelets, and a 
pathological IL-2/IL-6/Viremia/Monocyte/PT bond. Later on, the biomarker network 
highlighted the interaction IFN-gamma/PLT/DENV-3(IgM;HAI)/PT, and the involvement
of type-2 cytokines (IL-4; IL-5). Our findings demonstrated that C. penicillata
is a feasible experimental model for dengue virus infection, which could be
useful to pathogenesis studies, discovery of novel antiviral drugs as well as to 
evaluate vaccine candidates against DENV.

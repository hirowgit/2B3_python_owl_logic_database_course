The marmoset is an important nonhuman primate model for regenerative medicine.
For experimental autologous cell therapy based on induced pluripotent (iPS) cells
in the marmoset, cells must be able to undergo robust and reliable directed
differentiation that will not require customization for each specific iPS cell
clone. When marmoset iPS cells were aggregated in a hanging drop format for 3
days, followed by exposure to dual SMAD inhibitors and retinoic acid in monolayer
culture for 3 days, we found substantial variability in the response of different
iPS cell clones. However, when clones were pretreated with 0.05-2% dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO) for 24 hours, all clones showed a very similar maximal response 
to the directed differentiation scheme. Peak responses were observed at 0.5% DMSO
in two clones and at 1% DMSO in a third clone. When patterns of gene expression
were examined by microarray analysis, hierarchical clustering showed very similar
responses in all 3 clones when they were pretreated with optimal DMSO
concentrations. The change in phenotype following exposure to DMSO and the 6 day 
hanging drop/monolayer treatment was confirmed by immunocytochemistry. Analysis
of DNA content in DMSO-exposed cells indicated that it is unlikely that DMSO acts
by causing cells to exit from the cell cycle. This approach should be generally
valuable in the directed neural differentiation of pluripotent cells for
experimental cell therapy.

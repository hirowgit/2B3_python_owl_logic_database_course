By using healthy common marmoset monkeys, Yamada et al traced the
retinogeniculate pathways with ultra high-spatial-resolution manganese-enhanced
magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and diffusion-tensor imaging at 7 T. Both methods
were compared with morphologic findings described in published histopathologic
studies. Both methods provided identical tracing of the optic nerve, optic
chiasm, and optic tracts to the level of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN),
faithfully reproducing the crossing of the nasal portion of the optic nerve at
the level of the chiasm into the contralateral optic tract. This study strongly
suggests that diffusion-tensor imaging, a noninvasive method that can be used in 
human research and clinical practice, has the potential to provide accurate
tracing of specific white matter tracts that correspond to actual anatomic and
functional units in the central nervous system.

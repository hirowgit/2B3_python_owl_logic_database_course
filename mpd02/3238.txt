1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), via its major metabolite
1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP(+)), produces in primates including humans
clinical, biochemical, and neuropathological changes similar to those which occur
in idiopathic Parkinson's disease. Ebselen is an antioxidant drug with
glutathione peroxidase-like activity and a proven neuroprotective action in
stroke patients. Here we show that Ebselen, when administered before, during, and
after MPTP injections, prevents both neuronal loss and clinical symptoms in a
primate MPTP model of Parkinson's disease. Ebselen also prevents peroxide radical
overproduction induced by serum withdrawal in cultured PC12 cells and hydroxyl
radical generation induced by the mitochondrial toxin, MPP(+), in vivo in rat
brain. Moreover, Ebselen inhibits MPP(+)-induced toxicity in PC12 cells, without 
interacting with the dopamine uptake system. Our results demonstrate that
compounds which prevent mitochondrial dysfunction and free radical production may
be useful as preventive treatment of Parkinson's disease.

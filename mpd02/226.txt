Plasma concentrations of acetaminophen, its glucuronide and sulfate conjugates,
and cysteinyl acetaminophen were experimentally determined after oral
administrations of 10 mg/kg in humanised-liver mice, control mice, rats, common
marmosets, cynomolgus monkeys, and minipigs; the results were compared with
reported human pharmacokinetic data. Among the animals tested, only rats
predominantly converted acetaminophen to sulfate conjugates, rather than
glucuronide conjugates. In contrast, the values of area under the plasma
concentration curves of acetaminophen, its glucuronide and sulfate conjugates,
and cysteinyl acetaminophen after oral administration of acetaminophen in
marmosets and minipigs were consistent with those reported in humans under the
present conditions. Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models
(consisting of the gut, liver, and central compartments) for acetaminophen and
its primary metabolite could reproduce and estimate, respectively, the plasma and
hepatic concentrations of acetaminophen in experimental animals and humans after 
single virtual oral doses. The values of area under the curves of hepatic
concentrations of acetaminophen estimated using PBPK models were correlated with 
the measured levels of cysteinyl acetaminophen (a deactivated metabolite) in
plasma fractions in these species. Consequently, using simple PBPK models and
plasma data to predict hepatic chemical concentrations after oral doses could be 
helpful as an indicator of in vivo possible hepatotoxicity of chemicals such as
acetaminophen.

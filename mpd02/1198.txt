Trichomonadid protozoa have been found in the intestinal tracts of common
marmosets (Callithrix jacchus). However, there is little information available on
species identification and the pathogenicity of these trichomonads. In this
study, we conducted a fecal survey of a common marmoset colony maintained as
laboratory animals in Japan and identified the trichomonad species. Screening
using a fecal smear examination revealed that 66% (58/88) of the marmosets had
trichomonadid trophozoites in their feces. The trichomonads were found in both
normal feces (31/49, 63%) and diarrhea (27/39, 69%), with no significant
difference in frequency. The protozoa were identified as Pentatrichomonas hominis
using morphological characters and the 100% identity of the nucleotide sequence
of the partial 18S rRNA gene (297 bp). The intraspecific genetic variability
between P. hominis from the marmosets in this study and P. hominis from other
reported mammal hosts was â‰¤1% in the nucleotide sequence, including the internal 
transcribed spacer (ITS)-1, 5.8S rRNA gene, and ITS-2 (293 bp). P. hominis
inhabits the large intestine of various mammalian hosts, including primates, and 
is considered nonpathogenic. These results suggest that P. hominis is transmitted
among marmosets and other mammals but is not a primary cause of bowel disease in 
marmosets.

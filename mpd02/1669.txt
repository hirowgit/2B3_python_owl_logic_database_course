BACKGROUND: l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA)-induced dyskinesia (LID) are a 
complication of chronic dopamine replacement therapy in Parkinson's disease (PD).
Recent studies have suggested that the mechanisms underlying development and
expression of LID in PD may involve epigenetic changes that include deacetylation
of striatal histone proteins. We hypothesised that inhibition of histone
deacetylase, the enzyme responsible of histone deacetylation, would alleviate
LID.
METHODS: Four female common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) were rendered
parkinsonian by administration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine
(MPTP). Following stabilisation of the parkinsonian phenotype, marmosets were
primed to exhibit dyskinesia with chronic administration of L-DOPA. We then
investigated the effects of the brain-penetrant histone deacetylase inhibitor,
RGFP109 (30 mg/kg p.o. once daily for 6 days), on LID and L-DOPA
anti-parkinsonian efficacy.
RESULTS: RGFP109 had no acute effects on dyskinesia after single or 6 days
once-daily treatment (both P > 0.05). However, one week following cessation of
RGFP109, dyskinesia and duration of ON-time with disabling dyskinesia were
reduced by 37% and 50%, respectively (both P < 0.05), compared to that seen
previously with L-DOPA alone. There was no change in anti-parkinsonian actions
of, or ON-time duration afforded by, L-DOPA (P > 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Histone deacetylation inhibition may represent a novel approach to
reverse established LID in PD and improve quality of the anti-parkinsonian
benefit provided by L-DOPA.

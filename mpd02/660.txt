This paper investigates the methods to detect and classify marmoset vocalizations
automatically using a large data set of marmoset vocalizations and deep learning 
techniques. For vocalization detection, neural networks-based methods, including 
deep neural network (DNN) and recurrent neural network with long short-term
memory units, are designed and compared against a conventional rule-based
detection method. For vocalization classification, three different classification
algorithms are compared, including a support vector machine (SVM), DNN, and long 
short-term memory recurrent neural networks (LSTM-RNNs). A 1500-min audio data
set containing recordings from four pairs of marmoset twins and manual
annotations is employed for experiments. Two test sets are built according to
whether the test samples are produced by the marmosets in the training set (test 
set I) or not (test set II). Experimental results show that the LSTM-RNN-based
detection method outperformed others and achieved 0.92% and 1.67% frame error
rate on these two test sets. Furthermore, the deep learning models obtained
higher classification accuracy than the SVM model, which was 95.60% and 91.67% on
the two test sets, respectively.

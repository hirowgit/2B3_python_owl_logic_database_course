The metabolism of 2-amino-3-methylpyridine (2A3MP) in vitro has been investigated
using the rat, rabbit, dog, marmoset, guinea pig and hamster hepatic microsomes
and S9 supernatants (10,000 g fraction). Species differences were observed in the
in vitro formation of 2-amino-3-methylpyridine-N-oxide (2A3MPNO),
2-amino-3-hydroxymethylpyridine (2A3HMP) and 2-amino-3-methyl-5-hydroxypyridine
(2A3M5HP). The order of activity for 2A3MPNO using hepatic microsomes was dog >
rat > rabbit > guinea pig > marmoset > hamster, for 2A3HMP dog > hamster > guinea
pig > rat > rabbit > marmoset, for 2A3M5HP rabbit > hamster > dog > rat > guinea 
pig > marmoset. When hepatic S9 supernatants from various uninduced species were 
used, rabbit was more active for the production of 2A3MPNO and 2A3M5HP whilst
hamster was more effective for the formation of 2A3HMP. Pretreatment of rats with
arochlor 1254 enhanced the formation of all metabolites. No species produced a
metabolite having the properties of 2-hydroxylamino-3-methylpyridine or further
oxidation or condensation products. The present study did not show the presence
of any new metabolite after co-incubation of 2A3MP with norharman.

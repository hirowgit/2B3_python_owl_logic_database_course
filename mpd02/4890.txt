Skeletal development in the foetal and neonatal marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).

Phillips IR.

Qualitative and quantitative measurements of skeletal development were performed 
on foetal marmosets in utero and on fixed specimens of both foetuses and
neonates. The sequence of skeletal changes may be used to assess developmental
status and the prenatal growth of the marmoset is compared with that of other
primate species.

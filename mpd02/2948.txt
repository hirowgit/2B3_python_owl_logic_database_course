This work describes a mapping study of phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase
(PNMT) immunoreactive neurones and fibres in the medulla oblongata of the
marmoset monkey, Callithrix jacchus. Two groups of PNMT-immunoreactive neurones
were found in the marmoset monkey medulla oblongata: a ventrolateral (C1 group)
and a dorsomedial PNMT-immunoreactive cells group (C2 group). The
PNMT-immunoreactive cells in the ventrolateral group C1 were found to be located 
around the lateral reticular nucleus. The PNMT-immunoreactive somata within the
ventrolateral medulla are round to oval, and mostly multipolar with branched
processes. In the dorsomedial group C2, PNMT-immunoreactive cell bodies appeared 
near the obex. The majority of the dorsomedial PNMT-immunoreactive neurones were 
observed in the nucleus tractus solitarius; although some were present in the
dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus. The PNMT-immunoreactive somata in the
dorsomedial medulla were small and round or ovoid. These results provide
information upon the adrenergic system in the medulla oblongata of a species that
presents a useful model of a small primate brain, the marmoset monkey.

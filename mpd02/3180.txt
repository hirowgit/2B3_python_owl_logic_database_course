Chorionic gonadotropin (CG) is a placental derived hormone that plays a crucial
role in successful implantation and establishment of early pregnancy in the
primates. The rhesus monkey was chosen as a model to understand the feasibility
of developing human DNA immuno-contraceptive. The coding region of rhesus monkey 
CG beta-subunit (rmCGbeta) was isolated by the TDRT-PCR method. The nucleotide
sequence including the leader peptide was 499 nucleotide long and encoded 166
amino acids. In comparing with the previous known primates CG beta-subunits, the 
rmCGbeta was the highest degree of homology with baboon CG beta-subunit at the
deduced amino acid sequence (94%), 79.5% homology with human CG beta-subunit and 
70.4% homology with marmoset monkey CG beta-subunit. The eukaryotic expression
vector pCMV4-rmCGbeta inserted full-coding cDNA sequence of rmCGbeta was
constructed, and the expression of rmCG beta-subunit in HeLa cells transient
expressing system in vitro and BALB/c mice in vivo was determined. The results
demonstrated that the recombinant PCMV4-rmCGbeta eukaryotic expression vector
could express rmCG beta-subunit in vitro and in vivo.

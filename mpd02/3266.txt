From 1991 to 1995, eight New World nonhuman primates of the family Callitrichidae
belonging to the collection of Fundacão Parque Zoologico de São Paulo died of
toxoplasmosis. Of the eight affected nonhuman primates, four were Leontopithecus 
chrysomelas (one male, three females) and four were Saguinus imperator (two
males, two females). The most commonly affected organs were the lungs, liver, and
lymph nodes, with hemorrhagic and necrotic lesions. Histopathologic examination
revealed protozoa that were morphologically consistent with Toxoplasma gondii.
Immunohistochemical assays were strongly positive for T. gondii.

Common marmosets are members of the family Callitrichidae, South American
primates characterized by highly social group living and cooperative breeding. In
this study we analysed 1112 base pairs (bp) of the mitochondrial control region
in 59 Callithrix jacchus individuals, sampled mainly from two geographically
distinct field sites in N.E. Brazil. Analysis of molecular variation revealed a
highly significant genetic structuring of haplotypes between social groups and
between populations. Examination of matrilineal genetic structure within social
groups revealed that seven of nine recorded breeding pairs were from different
maternal lineages, indicating assortative mating and outbreeding. In addition to 
the breeders, at least six of 10 groups contained adult individuals from
different matrilines, with five haplotypes present in one social group of nine
animals. Groups of mixed lineages raise questions about potential reproductive
conflicts of interest, and the extent of kin-selected altruism in the evolution
and maintenance of cooperative breeding in this species.

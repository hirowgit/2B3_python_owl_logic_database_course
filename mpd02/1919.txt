In 2009, we reported an online brain atlas of the common marmoset (Callithrix
jacchus) at http://marmoset-brain.org:2008. Here we report new digital images of 
the primate spinal cord sections added to the website. We prepared histological
sections of every segment of the spinal cord of the common marmoset, rhesus
monkey and Japanese monkey with various staining techniques. The sections were
scanned with Carl Zeiss MIRAX SCAN at light microscopic resolution. Obtained
digital data were processed and converted into multi-resolutionary images with
Adobe Photoshop and Zoomify Design. These images of the primate spinal cords are 
now available on the web via the Internet.

1. The pharmacokinetics were investigated for human cytochrome P450 probes after 
single intravenous and oral administrations of 0.20 and 1.0 mg/kg, respectively, 
of caffeine, warfarin, omeprazole, metoprolol and midazolam to aged (10-14 years 
old, n = 4) or rifampicin-treated/young (3 years old, n = 3) male common
marmosets all genotyped as heterozygous for a cytochrome P450 2C19 variant. 2.
Slopes of the plasma concentration-time curves after intravenous administration
of warfarin and midazolam were slightly, but significantly (two-way analysis of
variance), decreased in aged marmosets compared with young marmosets. The mean
hepatic clearances determined by in silico fitting for individual pharmacokinetic
models of warfarin and midazolam in the aged group were, respectively, 23% and
56% smaller than those for the young group. 3. Significantly enhanced plasma
clearances of caffeine, warfarin, omeprazole and midazolam were evident in young 
marmosets pretreated with rifampicin (25 mg/kg daily for 4 days). Two- to
three-fold increases in hepatic intrinsic clearance values were observed in the
individual pharmacokinetic models. 4. The in vivo dispositions of multiple
simultaneously administered drugs in old, young and P450-enzyme-induced marmosets
were elucidated. The results suggest that common marmosets could be experimental 
models for aged, induced or polymorphic P450 enzymes in P450-dependent drug
metabolism studies.

Cerebral beta-amyloidosis was found in 16/18 marmosets aged <10 yrs and 8/9
marmosets aged >10 yrs, injected intracerebrally with human or marmoset brain
homogenate containing beta-amyloid 1-8 years previously. It was found in only
2/12 marmosets aged <10 yrs and 1/15 marmosets aged >10 yrs, injected with
synthetic Abeta-peptides, CSF, or brain tissue which did not contain
beta-amyloid. Cerebral beta-amyloidosis was found in 0/11 uninjected marmosets
aged <10 yrs and in 5/29 uninjected marmosets aged >10 yrs. The beta-amyloidosis 
comprised small and large vessel angiopathy and some plaques throughout cortex
and was qualitatively similar in injected marmosets and, when present, in
uninjected marmosets. Of those injected marmosets which were positive, the amount
of beta-amyloidosis was unrelated to age or incubation times but the 3 injected
marmosets without beta-amyloidosis had incubation times of <3.5 years. We
conclude that beta-amyloid, or associated factors, can initiate or accelerate the
process of cerebral amyloidosis in primates.

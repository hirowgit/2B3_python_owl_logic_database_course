Transplantation of pig islet cells for the treatment of diabetes may be a more
effective approach compared with the application of insulin. However, before
introduction into the clinic, efficacy and safety of this treatment have to be
shown. Non-human primate models may be used for this, despite the fact that they 
are characterised by several limitations. Here we investigate the prevalence of
porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERVs), which are present in the genome of all
pigs and which may infect human cells, as well as of porcine herpes viruses in
donor pigs and their potential transmission to non-human primate recipients.
Despite the fact that all three subtypes of PERV were present in all and porcine 
cytomegalovirus (PCMV) was found in some of the pigs, neither PERVs nor PCMV were
found in the recipient animals under the experimental conditions applied. Porcine
lymphotropic herpes viruses (PLHV) were not found in the donor pigs, hepatitis E 
virus (HEV) was not found in the recipients.

We have tracked the evolutionary history of chromosomes homologous to HSA10
(PHYL-10) in primates using appropriate panels of PCP, YAC, and BAC probes. This 
approach allowed us to delineate more precisely the PHYL-10 constitution in the
ancestor of catarrhine, platyrrhine, and prosimians. The results suggest that (i)
in the ancestor of prosimians PHYL-10 was organized in two separate PHYL-10p and 
PHYL-10q chromosomes; (ii) in the progenitor of New World monkeys PHYL-10p was a 
separate chromosome, while PHYL-10q was associated with a chromosome homologous
to HSA16; (iii) in the ancestor of Old World monkeys PHYL-10 was a unique
chromosome with a marker order corresponding to the orang form. We have also
analyzed the cat, chosen as an outgroup for its very conserved karyotype. In
agreement with published data our experiments show that the PHYL-10 in cat is
structured in two blocks, PHYL-10p and PHYL-10q, both as part of larger
chromosomes. The overall data indicate that, contrary to common opinion, PHYL-10p
and PHYL-10q were distinct chromosomes in the primate ancestor. Analysis of the
Saimiri sciureus (SSC) PHYL-10q marker order showed that it was isosequential
with the Callithrix jacchus PHYL-10q, as well as with the PHYL-10q platyrrhine
ancestral form. The SSC centromere, nevertheless, was located in a different
chromosomal region, therefore suggesting that a centromeric repositioning event
occurred in this species.

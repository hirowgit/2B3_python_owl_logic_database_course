We review here the distribution of S-cone signals and properties of S-cone
recipient receptive fields in subcortical pathways. Nearly everything we know
about S-cone signals in the subcortical visual system comes from the study of
visual systems in cats and primates (monkeys); in this review, we concentrate on 
results from macaque and marmoset monkeys. We discuss segregation of S-cone
recipient (blue-on and blue-off) receptive fields in the dorsal lateral
geniculate nucleus and describe their receptive field properties. We treat in
some detail the question of detecting weak S-cone signals as an introduction for 
newcomers to the field. Finally, we briefly consider the question on how S-cone
signals are distributed among nongeniculate targets.

Common marmosets were treated daily with
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP, 7-9 mg/kg i.p.) for 25 days, 
and then kept out of drug for three months before biochemical measurements in
various brain areas. This treatment induced a dramatic fall (-80%) in dopamine,
homovanillic acid and dihydroxyphenylacetic acid levels in the putamen and
caudate nucleus, and a significant but less pronounced reduction (less than or
equal to 50%) in the levels of these compounds in the nucleus accumbens. In
contrast, the concentrations of four neuropeptides: met-enkephalin,
leu-enkephalin, substance P, and cholecystokinin, remained unaltered in all brain
areas examined in MPTP-treated marmosets. Therefore the neuropeptide alterations 
previously reported in Parkinson's disease are probably not secondary to the
severe lesion of dopaminergic neurones, but constitute another intrinsic feature 
of the disease.

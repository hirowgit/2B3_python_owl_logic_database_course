MRI at 7 Tesla has been used to investigate the accumulation of manganese in the 
occipital cortex of common marmoset monkeys (Callithrix jacchus) after
administering four fractionated injections of 30 mg/kg MnCl(2) . 4H(2)O in the
tail vein. We found a statistically significant decrease in T(1) in the primary
(V1) and secondary (V2) areas of the visual cortex caused by an accumulation of
manganese. The larger T(1) shortening in V1 (DeltaT(1) = 640 ms) relative to V2
(DeltaT(1) = 490 ms) allowed us to robustly detect the V1/V2 border in vivo using
heavily T(1)-weighted MRI. Furthermore, the dorso-medial (DM) and middle-temporal
(MT) areas of the visual pathway could be identified by their T(1)-weighted
enhancement. We showed by comparison to histological sections stained for
cytochrome oxidase (CO) activity that the extent of V1 is accurately identified
throughout the visual cortex by manganese-enhanced MRI (MEMRI). This provides a
means of visualizing functional cortical regions in vivo and could be used in
longitudinal studies of phenomena such as cortical plasticity, and for
non-destructive localization of cortical regions to guide in the implementation
of functional techniques.

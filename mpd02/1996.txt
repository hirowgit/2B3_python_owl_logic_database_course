Parent-offspring attachment is important for animals which have offspring that
require parental care for their development. Infant attachment to the mother has 
been examined in macaques, but it remains poorly understood in common marmosets. 
Here, we examined the abilities of 14 common marmoset infants to show preference 
for their parents over adults from another group at the ages of 4, 10, and
15 weeks. Each infant was exposed to its parent and an adult from another group
in an I-shaped maze. Although 4-week-old infants did not show a significant
difference between approach behaviors toward their parents and other adults, 10- 
and 15-week-old infants approached and stayed longer near their parents than
adults from another group. These results suggest selective approach behavior
develops in marmosets by the age of 10 weeks.

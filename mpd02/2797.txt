OBJECTIVE: Although olfactory disturbance appears to occur in the early stages of
Parkinson's disease (PD) in humans, little is known about its mechanism. The aim 
of this study was to make a PD model using injection of
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) in the common marmoset and to
discover the mechanism of olfactory disturbance in this animal.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Olfactory disturbance induced by MPTP in the common
marmoset was observed by behavioral, biochemical and immunohistochemical means.
RESULTS: Administration of MPTP caused common marmosets to enter an akinetic
state within a few days and to show signs of impaired olfactory function.
Biochemical study showed a decrease in dopamine levels, especially in tissue
samples from the caudate nucleus and putamen. Immunohistochemical analysis
revealed a lack of tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity, not only in the
substantia nigra, caudate nucleus and putamen but also in the olfactory tubercle.
CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that MPTP causes both PD-like symptoms and 
olfactory disturbance in the common marmoset. The olfactory disturbance observed 
in these animals may be due to the lack of dopamine in the olfactory tubercle.

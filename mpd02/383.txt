Treatments for refractory glaucoma include trabeculectomy, in which a filtering
bleb is created to reduce aqueous pressure. Mitomycin C (MMC) is often used as an
adjuvant to reduce post-trabeculectomy bleb scarring and consequent failure.
However, scarring sometimes still occurs. Thus, we searched for more effective
trabeculectomy adjuvants with high-throughput screening (HTS) of a library of
1,165 off-patent drug compounds. This revealed that amsacrine (AMSA), a DNA
topoisomerase II (TOP2) inhibitor, was the top candidate. Compared to MMC,
rabbits that underwent trabeculectomy with 10% AMSA had lower IOP at 42, 56, and 
70 days (P < 0.01 at all measurement points) and a higher bleb score at 28, 42,
56, and 70 days (P =  < 0.01, 0.04, 0.04, and < 0.01, respectively). Compared to 
saline, rabbits that received 1% AMSA also had lower IOP and better bleb score at
all time points, without a sharp drop in IOP just after surgery (all P < 0.01).
Both effects were milder than MMC at 7 days (P = 0.02 and <0.01, respectively).
Thus, this study showed that HTS may help identify new, promising uses for
off-patent drugs. Furthermore, trabeculectomy with AMSA at a suitable
concentration may improve the prognosis after trabeculectomy compared to MMC.

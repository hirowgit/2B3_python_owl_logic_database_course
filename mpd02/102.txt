The common marmoset Callithrix jacchus encodes two glutathione transferase (GST) 
enzymes with ketosteroid double-bond isomerase activity. The most active enzyme
is CjaGST A3-3 showing a specific activity with 5-androsten-3,17-dione (Δ5-AD) of
62.1 ± 1.8 μmol min-1 mg-1, and a kcat value of 261 ± 49 s-1. The second
ketosteroid isomerase CjaGST A1-1 has a 30-fold lower specific activity with
Δ5-AD and a 37-fold lower kcat value. Thus, the marmoset CjaGST A3-3 would be the
main contributor to the biosynthesis of the steroid hormones testosterone and
progesterone, like the human ortholog HsaGST A3-3. Two residues differ in the
H-site of the 91.4% sequence identical CjaGST A1-1 and CjaGST A3-3, and modeling 
of the structures suggests that the bulky phenyl ring of Phe111 in CjaGST A1-1
causes steric hindrance in the binding of the steroid substrate. Tributyltin
acetate (IC50=0.16 ± 0.004 μM) and ethacrynic acid (IC50=3.3 ± 0.2 μM) were found
to be potent inhibitors of CjaGST A3-3, as previously demonstrated with the human
and equine orthologs.

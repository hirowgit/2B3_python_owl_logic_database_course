A fast protein liquid chromatographic (FPLC) system with pre-packed and
laboratory-packed columns was used for the analytical and preparative isolation
of marmoset monkey cytochrome P-450 (P450) and NADPH-P450-reductase.
Chromatographic separations also allowed the recovery of cytochrome b5,
NADH-b5-reductase and epoxide hydratase. Cholate-solubilized liver microsomes
from phenobarbital-induced marmosets were crudely purified on
8-aminooctyl-Sepharose or 6-aminohexyl-Sepharose and then fractionated into
several isoenzyme groups using hydroxyapatite. Further purification on Mono S or 
CM-Sepharose and finally on phenyl-Superose, phenyl-Sepharose or octyl-Sepharose 
yielded a P450 fraction which was apparently homogeneous as judged by sodium
dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the automated Phast system
using silver staining. Removal of excess of non-ionic detergent was effected by
hydroxyapatite columns, and this was compared with other methods. For the
isolation of P450 isoenzymes from untreated marmosets, Mono Q columns were
employed and yielded at least two highly purified forms. NADPH-P450-reductase was
recovered from the 8-aminooctyl-Sepharose column or crudely fractionated on
DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow. Subsequent purification via 2',5'-ADP-Sepharose and
Superose 12 chromatography resulted in a homogeneous preparation.

Early recognition of whether a product has potential as a new therapy for
treating multiple sclerosis (MS) relies upon the quality of the animal models
used in the preclinical trials. The promising effects of new treatments in rodent
models of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) have rarely been
reproduced in patients suffering from MS. EAE in outbred marmoset monkeys,
Callithrix jacchus, is a valid new model, and might provide an experimental link 
between EAE in rodent models and human MS. Using magnetic resonance imaging
techniques similar to those used in patients suffering from MS pathological
abnormalities in the brain, white matter of the animal can be visualized and
quantified. Moreover, NMR spectroscopy, in combination with pattern recognition, 
offers an advanced uroscopic technique for the identification of biomarkers of
inflammatory demyelination.

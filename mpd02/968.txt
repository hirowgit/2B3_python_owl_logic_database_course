The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a highly vocal New World primate
species that has emerged in recent years as a promising model system for studies 
of auditory and vocal processing. Our recent studies have examined perceptual
mechanisms related to the pitch of harmonic complex tones in this species.
However, no previous psychoacoustic work has measured marmosets' frequency
discrimination abilities for pure tones across a broad frequency range. Here we
systematically examined frequency difference limens (FDLs), which measure the
minimum discriminable frequency difference between two pure tones, in marmosets
across most of their hearing range. Results show that marmosets' FDLs are
comparable to other New World primates, with lowest values in the frequency range
of ∼3.5-14 kHz. This region of lowest FDLs corresponds with the region of lowest 
hearing thresholds in this species measured in our previous study and also with
the greatest concentration of spectral energy in the major types of marmoset
vocalizations. These data suggest that frequency discrimination in the common
marmoset may have evolved to match the hearing sensitivity and spectral
characteristics of this species' vocalizations.

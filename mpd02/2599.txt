To investigate the relationships between the activity in different types of taste
fibers and the gustatory behavior in marmosets, we used the taste modifier
miraculin, which in humans adds a sweet taste quality to sour stimuli. In
behavioral experiments, we measured marmosets' consumption of acids before and
after tongue application of miraculin. In electrophysiological experiments
responses of single taste fibers in chorda tympani and glossopharyngeal nerves
were recorded before and after tongue application of miraculin. We found that
after miraculin marmosets consumed acids more readily. Taste nerve recordings
showed that after miraculin taste fibers which usually respond only to
sweeteners, S fibers, became responsive to acids. These results further support
our hypothesis that the activity in S fibers is translated into a hedonically
positive behavioral response.

GAP-43 is a vertebrate neuron-specific protein and that is strongly related to
axon growth and regeneration; thus, this protein has been utilized as a classical
molecular marker of these events and growth cones. Although GAP-43 was
biochemically characterized more than a quarter century ago, how this protein is 
related to these events is still not clear. Recently, we identified many
phosphorylation sites in the growth cone membrane proteins of rodent brains. Two 
phosphorylation sites of GAP-43, S96 and T172, were found within the top 10 hit
sites among all proteins. S96 has already been characterized (Kawasaki et al.,
2018), and here, phosphorylation of T172 was characterized. In vitro (cultured
neurons) and in vivo, an antibody specific to phosphorylated T172 (pT172
antibody) specifically recognized cultured growth cones and growing axons in
developing mouse neurons, respectively. Immunoblotting showed that pT172 antigens
were more rapidly downregulated throughout development than those of pS96
antibody. From the primary structure, this phosphorylation site was predicted to 
be conserved in a wide range of animals including primates. In the developing
marmoset brainstem and in differentiated neurons derived from human induced
pluripotent stem cells, immunoreactivity with pT172 antibody revealed patterns
similar to those in mice. pT172 antibody also labeled regenerating axons
following sciatic nerve injury. Taken together, the T172 residue is widely
conserved in a wide range of mammals including primates, and pT172 is a new
candidate molecular marker for growing axons.

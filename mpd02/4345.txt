The connective tissue (CT) is responsible for stability and function of the whole
periodontium. It consists of cells, which are embedded in the extracellular
matrix. Collagen plays the main role for the function of the periodontal unit.
Collagen types I, III, IV, V and VI are distributed in a different pattern in all
periodontal tissues, as has been here demonstrated in the gingiva and alveolar
bone. Collagen type I, as a characteristic collagen type of the hard tissues, has
been demonstrated by thick collagen fibers in the alveolar bone and in the
gingival connective tissue. It can be differentiated from the thinner collagen
type III fibers, which are localized in the gingiva (especially under the
basement membrane of the epithelium) as well as only in the bone marrow stroma.
The epithelium, blood vessels and nerves contain the characteristic collagen type
IV in their basement membrane Filamentous (collagen type V) and microfibrillar
(collagen type VI) components demonstrate different patterns of distribution,
especially around the bone cells and in contrast to the other collagen types of
fibrillar networks in the gingival CT. This morphological differentiation of the 
extracellular matrix components of the periodontium allows conclusions in the
pathological and inflammatory processes as well as in the regenerative and
reparative procedures.

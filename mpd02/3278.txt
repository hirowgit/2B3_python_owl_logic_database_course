Four DNA datasets were combined in tandem (6700 bp) and Maximum parsimony and
Neighbor-Joining analyses were performed. The results suggest three groups
emerging almost at the same time: Atelidae, Pitheciidae and Cebidae. The total
analysis strongly supports the monophyly of the Cebidae family, grouping Aotus,
Cebus and Saimiri with the small callitrichines. In the callitrichines, the data 
link Cebuela to Callithrix, place Callimico as a sister group of
Callithrix/Cebuella, and show Saguinus to be the earliest offshoot of the
callitrichines. In the family Pithecidae, Callicebus is the basal genus. Finally,
combined molecular data showed congruent branching in the atelid clade, setting
up Alouatta as the basal lineage and Brachyteles-Lagothrix as a sister group and 
the most derived branch. Two major points remain to be clarified in the
platyrrhine phylogeny: (i) what is the exact branching pattern of Aotus, Cebus,
Saimiri and the small callitrichines, and (ii), which two of these three
lineages, pitheciines, atelines or cebids, are more closely related?

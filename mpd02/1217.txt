FILAMENTOUS FUNGI ISOLATED FROM THE FUR MICROBIOTA OF CALLITRICHIDS KEPT IN
CAPTIVITY IN BRAZIL.

de Freitas RA, Milanelo L, Bondan EF, Bentubo HD.

This study aimed to isolate filamentous fungi from the fur of primates of the
genus Callithrix kept in the Centre for Rehabilitation of Wild Animals (CRWA) at 
the Tietê Ecological Park, São Paulo, SP, Brazil. Samples of the fur of 19
specimens of black-tufted marmosets (Callithrix penicillata) and 6 specimens of
white-tufted-ear marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) were obtained by the square
carpet technique. The samples were plated on Mycosel™ agar medium (Difco™) and
incubated at 25°C for 21 days. The identification of each isolated mold was based
on its macroscopic and microscopic features and followed classical
recommendations. The following filamentous fungi were isolated: Penicillium spp. 
(76%), Cladosporium spp. (60%), Acremonium spp. (44%), Scopulariopsis spp. (24%),
Aspergillus spp. (16%), Chrysosporium spp. (16%), and Fusarium spp. (8%).
Dermatophyte fungi were not detected. We conclude that C. penicillata and C.
jacchus kept in captivity are sources of potentially pathogenic filamentous fungi
that may represent a risk factor for immunocompromised individuals who may
eventually establish contact with them.

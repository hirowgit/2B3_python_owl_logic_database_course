In autism spectrum disorder (ASD), disrupted functional and structural
connectivity in the social brain has been suggested as the core biological
mechanism underlying the social recognition deficits of this neurodevelopmental
disorder. In this study, we aimed to identify genetic and neurostructural
abnormalities at birth in a non-human primate model of ASD, the common marmoset
with maternal exposure to valproic acid (VPA), which has been reported to display
social recognition deficit in adulthood. Using a comprehensive gene expression
analysis, we found that 20 genes were significantly downregulated in VPA-exposed 
neonates. Of these, Frizzled3 (FZD3) and PIK3CA were identified in an axon
guidance signaling pathway. FZD3 is essential for the normal development of the
anterior commissure (AC) and corpus callosum (CC); hence, we performed diffusion 
tensor magnetic resonance imaging with a 7-Tesla scanner to measure the
midsagittal sizes of these structures. We found that the AC size in VPA-exposed
neonates was significantly smaller than that in age-matched controls, while the
CC size did not differ. These results suggest that downregulation of the genes
related to axon guidance and decreased AC size in neonatal primates may be linked
to social brain dysfunctions that can happen later in life.

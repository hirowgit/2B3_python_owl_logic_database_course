The validity of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) as a model for human
disease depends on the development of parameters with clinical relevance. We
tested the effect of treatment with MPTP in two newly developed non-invasive
motor behavioral paradigms in the context of Parkinson's disease. The "Tower" was
designed to quantify the marmoset's natural jumping behavior as a measure for
akinesia, the "Hourglass" to test the marmoset's natural righting reflex as
measure for rigidity, analogous to axial motor behavior in humans. MPTP treatment
affected marmoset behavior in both testing paradigms. The marmoset's righting
reflex in the Hourglass remained significantly impaired during the full 3-week
period after the MPTP intoxication. In the Tower, the marmosets were not able to 
jump the largest distances one week after MPTP and showed a persistent reduction 
in activity during the 3-week period after the MPTP intoxication. Because not all
aspects of motor behavior are similarly affected by MPTP, a complete behavioral
sketch of parkinsonian marmosets should preferably include a range of motor
behavior functions to create an overview of the full range of motor impairments. 
Both the Hourglass and Tower test provide important behavioral parameters in a
clinically relevant multiple testing approach in motor disorder models.

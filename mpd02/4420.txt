The effect of renin inhibitor ES-1005 on renin gene expression was investigated
in sodium-depleted marmosets. The kidneys were removed after continuous infusion 
of ES-1005 (12 mg/kg per h) for 2 h. The relative amount of kidney renin
messenger (m)RNA was measured by densitometric Northern blot analysis using an
alpha-32P-labelled human renin complementary (c)DNA fragment as a hybridization
probe. Plasma renin activity was completely inhibited by ES-1005. The level of
kidney renin mRNA decreased significantly to about one-third of the normal
control value. We also investigated the inhibitory potency of the renin inhibitor
ES-6864 on the renin-like activity in dog tissues (adrenal glands, aorta and
brainstem). ES-6864 inhibited the tissue renin-like activity with an IC50 of
10(-7) to 10(-8) mol/l in vitro. Renin inhibitors not only inhibit the activity
of plasma and tissue renin, but also suppress the synthesis of renin in the
kidney.

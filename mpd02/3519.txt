Common marmosets with negative serum antibodies against hepatitis A virus
(anti-HAV) and normal liver functions were used for the tests of passage of H2
vaccine strain of HAV to explore its residual virulence after attenuation and
possibility of its reversion. Common marmosets were inoculated with attenuated
live vaccine, and fecal suspension and/or proliferative liquid in tissue culture 
of the progeny of vaccine HAV excreted from their feces were passaged in common
marmosets. Result of three serial passages in vivo indicated that there was no
significant difference in serum anti-HAV titer, and no or low-level changes in
activities of liver enzymes, no pathological changes in liver tissues observed,
and detectable but minimal HAV was shed in stool of the all animals.

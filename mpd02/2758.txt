Neutralizing the myelin-associated growth inhibitor Nogo-A in adult spinal
cord-injured rats can promote regeneration of injured and compensatory sprouting 
of uninjured axons. Nogo-A is present in humans, making its neutralization a
possible novel treatment option for paraplegic patients. In this study we
examined the effects of an extensively used anti-Nogo-A antibody (mAb IN-1) on
the regenerative capabilities of lesioned corticospinal tract (CST) axons in a
primate, the Marmoset monkey. Unilateral thoracic lesions of the CST were
performed in six adult Marmosets, followed by the application of mAb IN-1 into
the cerebrospinal fluid circulation by a graft of hybridoma cells. A unilateral
injection of biotin dextran amine into the motor cortex was performed to analyse 
sprouting and regeneration of the lesioned axons. In the control antibody-treated
animal CST fibers stopped rostral to the lesion site and often showed retraction 
bulbs. In contrast, in four out of five mAb IN-1-treated animals fine labeled
neurites had grown into, through and around the lesion site. Thus, this study
provides first anatomical evidence that in primates, the neutralization of the
myelin-associated inhibitor Nogo-A results in increased regenerative sprouting
and growth of lesioned spinal cord axons.

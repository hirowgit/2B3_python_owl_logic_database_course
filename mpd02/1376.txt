OBJECTIVE: Vascular permeability and inflammatory demyelination are intimately
linked in the brain, but what is their temporal relationship? We aimed to
determine the radiological correlates of the earliest tissue changes accompanying
demyelination in a primate model of multiple sclerosis (MS), experimental
autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in the common marmoset.
METHODS: By 7T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), T1 maps, proton density, and
T2-weighted images were acquired before and after EAE induction in 5 marmosets
(every other week before lesions appeared, weekly thereafter). From scans before 
and after intravenous injection of contrast material, we measured the evolution
of lesional blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, comparing in vivo MRI to
postmortem tissue examination.
RESULTS: On average, BBB permeability increased 3.5-fold (p < 0.0001) over the 4 
weeks prior to lesion appearance. Permeability gradually decreased after lesion
appearance, with attendant changes in the distribution of inflammatory cells
(predominantly macrophages and microglia) and demyelination. On tissue analysis, 
we also identified small perivascular foci of microglia and T cells without
blood-derived macrophages or demyelination. These foci had no visible MRI
correlates, although permeability within the foci, but not outside, increased in 
the weeks before the animals died (p < 0.0001).
INTERPRETATION: This study provides compelling evidence that in marmoset EAE,
which forms lesions strongly resembling those of MS, early changes in vascular
permeability are associated with perivascular inflammatory cuffing and
parenchymal microglial activation but precede the arrival of blood-derived
monocytes that accompany demyelination. Prospective detection of transient
permeability changes could afford an opportunity for early intervention to
forestall tissue damage in newly forming lesions.

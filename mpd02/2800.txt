Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) is the only myelin protein known to
initiate a demyelinating autoantibody response in EAE, an animal model for
multiple sclerosis (MS). The pathophysiological significance of MOG-specific
autoantibodies in MS is, however, controversial, as high titer antibody responses
to MOG are also found in many patients with non-demyelinating neurological
diseases. In this issue of the European Journal of Immunology, von BÃ¼dingen et
al. demonstrate that demyelination in a primate model of MOG-induced EAE is
mediated by MOG-specific antibodies directed against discontinuous, rather than
linear, MOG epitopes. This functional segregation of pathogenic vs.
non-pathogenic autoantibodies in terms of epitope specificity may be crucial to
understand the relevance of MOG-specific responses in human disease. This
commentary discusses these findings in the context of the structure and
immunobiology of MOG, and their implications with respect to antibody-mediated
demyelination in MS.

1. The distribution chondroitin 4- and 6-sulfates in the epiphysial cartilages of
several mammals are reported. 2. Chondroitin 6-sulfate is present in higher
relative proportion in articular surfaces of young and adult epiphysial
cartilages in most of the mammals studied. 3. Exception to this was found in some
species of the order Rodentia in which chondroitin 4-sulfate was almost the only 
chondroitin present in young and adult cartilages. 4. These and other results
suggest that chondroitin 4-sulfate may be an important component for the
calcification process, whereas chondroitin 6-sulfate seems to be related to the
integrity of the articular surfaces.

Monkeys with bilateral lesions of the CA1 field of the hippocampus produced by
the injection of neurotoxin diagonally along the length of the hippocampus were
found to have a severe impairment on the retention of a conditional task learnt
prior to surgery and on the new acquisition of several types of this task. They
were equally impaired on conditional tasks that required a spatial response or an
object choice in response to either visual or spatial cues. They were not
impaired on simple visual discrimination tasks, simple spatial discrimination
tasks or reversal learning of these tasks. This patterns of impairment resembles 
that seen in the same species with neurotoxic lesions within the vertical limb of
the diagonal band of Broca or transection of the fornix. Monkeys with subtotal
lesions of the adjacent medial temporal area were not consistently impaired on
any of these tasks. The results suggest that hippocampal lesions produce
anterograde and retrograde amnesia for information other than reward association.

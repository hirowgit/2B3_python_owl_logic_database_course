In the present study it was examined if the common marmoset was susceptible to
pravastatin (CAS 81131-70-6, CS 514, Mevalotin), an inhibitor of
3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase. It has been reported
that serum lipid levels in common marmosets resemble those in humans. First serum
total cholesterol and lipoprotein cholesterol levels of common marmosets were
examined in comparison with those in seven different experimental animals
including cynomolgus monkeys, beagle dogs, Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic
rabbits, Japanese White Rabbits, Sprague Dawley rats, Wistar-Imamichi rats and
golden hamsters. The animals were fed normal chow diets, and total- and
lipoprotein-cholesterol levels were determined under identical conditions. The
quantitative and polyacrylamide electrophoresis studies indicated that among
animals examined serum lipid and lipoprotein profiles in common marmosets were
similar to those in humans. When pravastatin at 1-30 mg/kg was orally
administered to common marmosets for 28 days, total, low density lipoprotein
(LDL)- and high density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels were decreased in a dose
dependent manner, whereas triglycerides and very low density lipoprotein
cholesterol did not change. These findings confirm that common marmosets have
serum lipid and lipoprotein profiles similar to those in humans suggesting that
they are susceptible to lipid lowering effects of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors.

Marmosets express a fetal zone during adrenal development but fail to produce
significant amounts of C19 steroids in adulthood. It is not clear however if
P450c17 regulation is different from that in humans/rhesus or the primary
sequence is altered. To this end we isolated marmoset and rhesus adrenocortical
cells, and treated the cells with known regulators of P450c17 expression for 48
h. P450c17 protein increased with Forskolin (F) treatment, but was marginally
inhibited by AII (A) and TPA (T) alone. Combined A + F and T + F dramatically
ablated the F response. Cortisol levels (EIA) increased upon F treatment and were
inhibited by A and T. Combination of treatments partially inhibited the F-induced
response. The protein-coding region of marmoset and rhesus P450c17 cDNAs were
then isolated from adrenals using RT-PCR/TA cloning. Marmoset P450c17 shows one
amino acid deletion but otherwise shares 90.6% and 91.4% homologies with the
human and rhesus cDNA sequences, and 82.4% and 85% homologies with the human and 
rhesus predicted AA sequences, respectively. Since marmoset adrenocortical cells 
exhibit similar endocrine function to rhesus, impaired 17,20-lyase activity in
the adult marmoset adrenal may in part be due to differences in the primary
sequence.

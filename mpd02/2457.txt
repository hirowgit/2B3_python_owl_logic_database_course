Investigation of halogen substitution in lead compound 1 has led to the
identification of analogues which combine high affinity for 5-HT(1A) receptors
and potent serotonin reuptake inhibitory activity. Several compounds show an
improved selectivity over 5-HT(1B) and 5-HT(1D) receptors and a superior
pharmacokinetic profile in the rat.

Studies with the baboon endogenous virus and its pseudotype of murine sarcoma
virus in marmosets.

Heberling RL, Kalter SS, Eichberg JW, Levy BM.

Three marmoset species (Saguinus oedipus oedipus, S. fuscicollis, Callithrix
jacchus) failed to show evidence of infection or disease following inoculation of
baboon endogenous type-C virus (BaEV). Cells infected with a Kirsten murine
sarcoma-BaEV pseudotype (MSV[BaEV]) produced a progressive fibrosarcoma in S. o. 
oedipus and tumors in S. fuscicollis and C. jacchus which regressed. Tumor
formation is believed to be due to growth of inoculated, virus-infected cells and
not transformation of marmoset cells. S. o. oedipus showed the best serum
neutralizing antibody response to BaEV and MSV(BaEV), S. fuscicollis a moderate
response and C. jacchus no response.

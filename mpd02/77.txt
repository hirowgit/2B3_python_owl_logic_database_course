The common marmoset has enormous promise as a nonhuman primate model of human
brain functions. While resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) has provided evidence 
for a similar organization of marmoset and human cortices, the technique cannot
be used to map the functional correspondences of brain regions between species.
This limitation can be overcome by movie-driven fMRI (md-fMRI), which has become 
a popular tool for noninvasively mapping the neural patterns generated by rich
and naturalistic stimulation. Here, we used md-fMRI in marmosets and humans to
identify whole-brain functional correspondences between the two primate species. 
In particular, we describe functional correlates for the well-known human face,
body, and scene patches in marmosets. We find that these networks have a similar 
organization in both species, suggesting a largely conserved organization of
higher-order visual areas between New World marmoset monkeys and humans. However,
while face patches in humans and marmosets were activated by marmoset faces, only
human face patches responded to the faces of other animals. Together, the results
demonstrate that higher-order visual processing might be a conserved feature
between humans and New World marmoset monkeys but that small, potentially
important functional differences exist.

The callitrichid primates, Callithrix jacchus jacchus (the marmoset) and Saguinus
labiatus (the tamarin) were inoculated with infective larvae of Brugia malayi and
B. pahangi. Microfilaraemia at low levels developed in 3 out of 4 C.j. jacchus
infected with B. malayi and living or dead adult worms found in all 4. Only one
of 4 C.j. jacchus became microfilaraemic (mf + ve) when given B. pahangi and
adults were found in two. Of 4 S. labiatus given B. pahangi one became very
lightly mf + ve and adults were found in 3. It is concluded that these animals
are not suitable hosts for chemotherapeutic experiments.

BACKGROUND: Equine herpesvirus 9 (EHV-9) is a new neurotropic equine herpesvirus 
which induced encephalitis in a variety of animals. However, there was no
information on the susceptibility of EHV-9 in primates.
METHODS: To assess the infectivity of EHV-9, four common marmosets (Callithrix
jacchus) were inoculated by the nasal route with 10(6) plaque-forming units of
EHV-9.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: All of the inoculated animals exhibited various
neurological signs progressing to collapse. Histologically, the affected animals 
had severe encephalitis characterized by neuronal degeneration and necrosis with 
intranuclear inclusion bodies, which extended from the olfactory bulb to the
rhinencephalon and piriform lobe. Immunohistochemistry revealed EHV-9 antigens in
degenerating neuronal cells. The nasal cavity had severe necrotizing rhinitis
with prominent intra-nuclear inclusion bodies in the olfactory mucosa. These
findings indicate that the marmosets are susceptible to EHV-9.

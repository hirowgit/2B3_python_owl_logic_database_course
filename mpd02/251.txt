From 2010 to 2015, 73 common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) housed at the
Wisconsin National Primate Research Center (WNPRC) were diagnosed postmortem with
lymphocytic enterocolitis. We used unbiased deep-sequencing to screen the blood
of deceased enterocolitis-positive marmosets for viruses. In five out of eight
common marmosets with lymphocytic enterocolitis, we discovered a novel pegivirus 
not present in ten matched, clinically normal controls. The novel virus, which we
named Southwest bike trail virus (SOBV), is most closely related (68% nucleotide 
identity) to a strain of simian pegivirus A isolated from a three-striped night
monkey (Aotus trivirgatus). We screened 146 living WNPRC common marmosets for
SOBV, finding an overall prevalence of 34% (50/146). Over four years, 85 of these
146 animals died or were euthanized. Histological examination revealed 27
SOBV-positive marmosets from this cohort had lymphocytic enterocolitis, compared 
to 42 SOBV-negative marmosets, indicating no association between SOBV and disease
in this cohort (p = 0.0798). We also detected SOBV in two of 33 (6%) clinically
normal marmosets screened during transfer from the New England Primate Research
Center, suggesting SOBV could be exerting confounding influences on comparisons
of common marmoset studies from multiple colonies.

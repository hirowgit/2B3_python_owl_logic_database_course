We have found that the common marmoset, Callithrix jacchus, displays a larger
left hemimouth during production of fear expressions, with or without
vocalization, and a larger right hemimouth when producing a social contact call. 
Thus, marmosets have right hemisphere specialization for the production of
negative emotional expressions and vocalizations and left hemisphere
specialization for the production of social contact communication. These
hemispheric specializations for social communication in marmosets are the same as
those found in humans for speech production and for the control of emotional
expressions. We suggest that hemispheric specializations for communication in
humans may well have precursors in primate evolution.

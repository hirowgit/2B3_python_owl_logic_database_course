Anti-predator vigilance and its sequence predictability in captive adult male
black tufted-ear marmosets (Callithrix penicillata) was analyzed under three
experimental conditions: (1) four novel (maze) environment habituation trials;
(2) six taxidermized (cat) predator confrontation trials in the same maze
environment; and (3) four additional maze-only trials, in the absence of the cat 
stimulus. Significant quantitative and qualitative differences (aerial vs.
terrestrial) were observed in scan and glance behaviors within and between the
three experimental conditions. Furthermore, inter-scan bout sequence
significantly deviated from randomness during the initial maze habituation and
predator confrontation trials, as well as during all predator removal trials.
This parameter, however, followed a random pattern during the course of the
remaining sessions. Therefore, vigilance in marmosets seems to be an important
and highly organized component of this species' anti-predation repertoire,
inasmuch as it occurs at high rates, alters according to specific environmental
cues and has a subtle differential adaptive response after repeated trials.

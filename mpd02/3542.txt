A case of zoonotic Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection in a marmoset (Callithrix
jacchus) is reported. Genomic typing of the relevant M. tuberculosis isolates
strongly suggests that the marmoset, which was kept as companion animal, acquired
the disease from an infected member in the household who had been treated for
pulmonary tuberculosis 8 years prior to this case.

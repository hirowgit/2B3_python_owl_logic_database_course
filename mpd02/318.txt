We describe our connectomics pipeline for processing anterograde tracer injection
data for the brain of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). Brain sections
were imaged using a batch slide scanner (NanoZoomer 2.0-HT) and we used
artificial intelligence to precisely segment the tracer signal from the
background in the fluorescence images. The shape of each brain was reconstructed 
by reference to a block-face and all data were mapped into a common 3D brain
space with atlas and 2D cortical flat map. To overcome the effect of using a
single template atlas to specify cortical boundaries, brains were cyto- and
myelo-architectonically annotated to create individual 3D atlases. Registration
between the individual and common brain cortical boundaries in the flat map space
was done to absorb the variation of each brain and precisely map all tracer
injection data into one cortical brain space. We describe the methodology of our 
pipeline and analyze the accuracy of our tracer segmentation and brain
registration approaches. Results show our pipeline can successfully process and
normalize tracer injection experiments into a common space, making it suitable
for large-scale connectomics studies with a focus on the cerebral cortex.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Human amnion epithelial cells (hAECs) are nonimmunogenic,
nontumorigenic, anti-inflammatory cells normally discarded with placental tissue.
We reasoned that their profile of biological features, wide availability, and the
lack of ethical barriers to their use could make these cells useful as a therapy 
in ischemic stroke.
METHODS: We tested the efficacy of acute (1.5 hours) or delayed (1-3 days)
poststroke intravenous injection of hAECs in 4 established animal models of
cerebral ischemia. Animals included young (7-14 weeks) and aged mice (20-22
months) of both sexes, as well as adult marmosets of either sex.
RESULTS: We found that hAECs administered 1.5 hours after stroke in mice migrated
to the ischemic brain via a CXC chemokine receptor type 4-dependent mechanism and
reduced brain inflammation, infarct development, and functional deficits.
Furthermore, if hAECs administration was delayed until 1 or 3 days poststroke,
long-term functional recovery was still augmented in young and aged mice of both 
sexes. We also showed proof-of-principle evidence in marmosets that acute
intravenous injection of hAECs prevented infarct development from day 1 to day 10
after stroke.
CONCLUSIONS: Systemic poststroke administration of hAECs elicits marked
neuroprotection and facilitates mechanisms of repair and recovery.

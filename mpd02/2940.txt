The expression profile of the monoclonal antibody SMI-32 was examined in the
superior colliculus of adult marmosets. This antibody recognises subunits of the 
non- and dephosphorylated neurofilament protein, labelling predominantly neuronal
perikarya and dendrites. The densest cellular label was observed in the
intermediate layers (primarily, the stratum griseum intermediale), consisting of 
large multi- or bipolar neurones which were preferentially located within
cytochrome oxidase-rich regions. The morphological characteristics of neurones
showing heavy staining resemble those of extrinsic projection cells, suggesting a
correlation between neurofilament content and axonal length.

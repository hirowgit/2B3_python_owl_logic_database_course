Ciliated cells of the respiratory epithelium play an essential role in the
mechanisms of mucociliary clearance, and ultrastructural alterations of cilia are
known to be associated with respiratory disease. The aim of this study was to
evaluate the presence of ciliary changes in common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus)
of different age groups and to compare healthy animals with animals suffering
from subclinical chronic inflammatory pulmonary lesions. Therefore, samples of
different sites of the tracheobronchial tree from 24 common marmosets were
investigated by transmission electron microscopy. Ciliary alterations were
present in all animals and were represented by compound cilia ("bulging/adhesive 
type"), extramatrix, extratubuli, and disorientation of the microtubular
arrangement. Ciliary alterations affected less than 1% of cilia (average
0.06%-0.55%) with no statistically significant differences between age groups,
sample localizations, or healthy and sick animals. The study results suggest that
ciliary alterations of secondary nature are a common background finding in common
marmosets with individual variability in abundance and have to be considered when
interpreting ultrastructural data from respiratory studies.

Retinal ganglion cells are projecting neurons that send visual information from
the retina to the brain. They generate different patterns of action potentials in
response to different kinds of visual information. In the retinas of mammals such
as mice or rabbits, there are functionally and morphologically diverse retinal
ganglion cells. However, in the primate retina, midget and parasol cells are
believed to be dominant, and show less diversity. In this study, we performed
organotypic culture of retinas and acute gene transfection of GFPs by gene-gun.
We found more diverse retinal ganglion cells, including directional selective
ganglion cells, than we expected, even in the retinas of primates such as common 
marmosets. Further, we found a third pathway from the retina to the brain via the
thalamus, in addition to the magnocellular and parvocellular pathways.

BACKGROUND: Although common marmosets seem to be appropriate animal models to
examine bone diseases, no data about the conclusiveness of less-invasive
techniques are available. Therefore, the aim was to combine different techniques 
to analyse changes in bone metabolism of common marmosets with bone diseases.
METHODS: Five monkeys were examined by X-ray, computer tomography (CT), histology
and immunohistochemistry (IHC).
RESULTS: Monkeys with lowest bone mineral density (BMD) showed increased bone
marrow, decreased cancellous bone and decreased contrast in X-ray. Highest
alkaline phosphatase (AP)-levels were detected in bones with low elastic modulus.
Expression of osteopontin (OPN), osteocalcin (OC) and runt-related transcriptions
factor 2 (RUNX 2) was detected in bones with high modulus. No expression was
present in bones with lower modulus. Collagen type I and V were found in every
bone.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, CT, X-ray and AP are useful techniques to detect bone
diseases in common marmosets. These observations could be confirmed by IHC.

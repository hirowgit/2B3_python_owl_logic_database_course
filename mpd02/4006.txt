The purpose of this study was to determine the in vitro activity of cefoxitin and
imipenem against strains of the Bacteroides fragilis group isolated from the
intestinal tract of humans and Callithrix penicillata marmosets. The majority of 
the human and marmosets B. fragilis strains was resistant to cefoxitin. The
percentages of resistance to cefoxitin among B. fragilis marmoset strains were
higher than those of human origin. On the other hand, the majority of the other
Bacteroides of the B. fragilis group isolated from human and marmosets were
susceptible to this drug. Imipenem was the most effective beta-lactam drug in
this study, and we detected no resistance.

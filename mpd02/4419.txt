There is considerable evidence suggesting that endogenous opioid peptides (EOP)
might play a role in the defensive response to stressful stimuli. The stress
associated with receipt of aggression from a female conspecific and physical
restraint for collection of serial blood samples (at 10-min intervals) resulted
in a significant (p less than 0.05) suppression of LH secretion in the oestradiol
primed ovariectomized marmoset. Administration of the opioid receptor antagonist,
Naloxone (1 mg/kg) immediately before and after receipt of aggression completely 
prevented the stress-induced decrease in LH release. This suggests that EOP may
mediate, at least in part, this stress induced decline in LH release in the
marmoset.

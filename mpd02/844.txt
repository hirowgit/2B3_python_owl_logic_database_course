Whole-brain imaging is becoming a fundamental means of experimental insight;
however, achieving subcellular resolution imagery in a reasonable time window has
not been possible. We describe the first application of multicolor ribbon
scanning confocal methods to collect high-resolution volume images of chemically 
cleared brains. We demonstrate that ribbon scanning collects images over ten
times faster than conventional high speed confocal systems but with equivalent
spectral and spatial resolution. Further, using this technology, we reconstruct
large volumes of mouse brain infected with encephalitic alphaviruses and
demonstrate that regions of the brain with abundant viral replication were
inaccessible to vascular perfusion. This reveals that the destruction or collapse
of large regions of brain micro vasculature may contribute to the severe disease 
caused by Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus. Visualization of this fundamental
impact of infection would not be possible without sampling at subcellular
resolution within large brain volumes.

The invasiveness of biomedical experiments on laboratory animals should be
limited to the greatest extent possible yet without sacrificing the quality of
the data collected. To this end, refinement techniques can be used. In the
present work, we describe some of these techniques, focussing on the familiarity 
of the experimental environment, alternative sampling techniques (including the
use of positive training), telemetry, and methods for improving ethological
experiments. As a model, we have chosen the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus),
which is frequently used in biomedical research.

Pyrrole-imidazole (PI) polyamides are novel gene silencers that strongly bind the
promoter region of target genes in a sequence-specific manner to inhibit gene
transcription. We created a PI polyamide targeting human TGF-β1 (hTGF-β1). To
develop this PI polyamide targeting hTGF-β1 (Polyamide) as a practical medicine
for treating progressive renal diseases, we examined the effects of Polyamide in 
two common marmoset models of nephropathy. We performed lead optimization of PI
polyamides that targeted hTGF-β1 by inhibiting in a dose-dependent manner the
expression of TGF-β1 mRNA stimulated by PMA in marmoset fibroblasts. Marmosets
were housed and fed with a 0.05% NaCl and magnesium diet and treated with
cyclosporine A (CsA; 37.5 mg/kg/day, eight weeks) to establish chronic
nephropathy. We treated the marmosets with nephropathy with Polyamide (1
mg/kg/week, four weeks). We also established a unilateral urethral obstruction
(UUO) model to examine the effects of Polyamide (1 mg/kg/week, four times) in
marmosets. Histologically, the renal medulla from CsA-treated marmosets showed
cast formation and interstitial fibrosis in the renal medulla.
Immunohistochemistry showed strong staining of Polyamide in the renal medulla
from CsA-treated marmosets. Polyamide treatment (1 mg/kg/week, four times)
reduced hTGF-β1 staining and urinary protein excretion in CsA-treated marmosets. 
In UUO kidneys from marmosets, Polyamide reduced the glomerular injury score and 
tubulointerstitial injury score. Polyamide significantly suppressed hTGF-β1 and
snail mRNA expression in UUO kidneys from the marmosets. Polyamide effectively
improved CsA- and UUO-associated nephropathy, indicating its potential
application in the prevention of renal fibrosis in progressive renal diseases.

The host range of most poliovirus (PV) strains is restricted to simians. This
host range specificity is believed to be determined by the interaction between PV
and its receptor molecule. To elucidate the molecular basis of this
species-specific infection of PV, we cloned orthologs of the PV receptor (PVR)
gene ( pvr) as well as those of PV receptor-related genes 1 and 2 ( prr1 and
prr2) from various mammalian species. These three genes are widely present in
mammalian genomes including those of non-susceptible species. Comparison of the
deduced amino acid sequences of PVR orthologs revealed that the NH(2)-terminal
immunoglobulin-like domain (domain 1), which is the virus binding site in the
human PVR, is highly variable among species, whereas that of PRR1 is highly
conserved. Domain 1 of the PVR orthologs for the ring-tailed lemur and rabbit,
which are not susceptible to PV, show only 51 and 61% amino acid sequence
identity to that of human PVR, respectively. Chimeric PVR proteins that have the 
domain 1 of the ring-tailed lemur and rabbit PVRs failed to serve as receptors
for PV. These results suggest that rapid changes in the domain 1 sequence during 
mammalian evolution determined the host range restriction of PV.

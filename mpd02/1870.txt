Previous studies have demonstrated that single neurons in the central nucleus of 
the inferior colliculus (ICC) are sensitive to multiple sound localization cues. 
We investigated the hypothesis that ICC neurons are specialized to encode
multiple sound localization cues that are aligned in space (as would naturally
occur from a single broadband sound source). Sound localization cues including
interaural time differences (ITDs), interaural level differences (ILDs), and
spectral shapes (SSs) were measured in a marmoset monkey. Virtual space methods
were used to generate stimuli with aligned and misaligned combinations of cues
while recording in the ICC of the same monkey. Mutual information (MI) between
spike rates and stimuli for aligned versus misaligned cues were compared. Neurons
with best frequencies (BFs) less than âˆ¼11 kHz mostly encoded information about a 
single sound localization cue, ITD or ILD depending on frequency, consistent with
the dominance of ear acoustics by either ITD or ILD at those frequencies. Most
neurons with BFs >11 kHz encoded information about multiple sound localization
cues, usually ILD and SS, and were sensitive to their alignment. In some neurons 
MI between stimuli and spike responses was greater for aligned cues, while in
others it was greater for misaligned cues. If SS cues were shifted to lower
frequencies in the virtual space stimuli, a similar result was found for neurons 
with BFs <11 kHz, showing that the cue interaction reflects the spectra of the
stimuli and not a specialization for representing SS cues. In general the results
show that ICC neurons are sensitive to multiple localization cues if they are
simultaneously present in the frequency response area of the neuron. However, the
representation is diffuse in that there is not a specialization in the ICC for
encoding aligned sound localization cues.

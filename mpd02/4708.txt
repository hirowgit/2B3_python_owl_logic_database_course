High molecular weight DNA extracted from 50 unrelated parisian individuals
constitutes a "DNA-thèque" which can be used at the population level. This
procedure allows preparation from a variety of tissues such as liver, placenta
and leucocytes. The "quality" of the DNA obtained (about 50 Kb, RNA and protein
free) and the efficiency of the method (in terms of the yield of DNA obtained)
are considered. Blood is the easiest material to obtain and permits the obtaining
of a reasonable amount of human and primate DNA, particularly when familial
investigation is planned for polymorphism studies. One of the objects of this
article is to encourage others to make use of our bank, for studies in population
and evolutionary genetics.

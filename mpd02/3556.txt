Metabolic bone disease was diagnosed in an 11-month-old female common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus). It was depressed, reluctant to move, and was cachectic and 
small for its age. Laboratory findings included anaemia, azotaemia and an inverse
calcium to phosphorus ratio. The radiological findings showed simultaneous signs 
of osteomalacia and soft-tissue calcification. There was decreased bone density
with lytic areas in the pelvis and femur, and severe bilateral nephrocalcinosis. 
Postmortem examination revealed marked focal dystrophic calcification of the epi-
and myocardium. Calcium and vitamin D3 deficiency (nutritional secondary
hyperparathyroidism) was the most likely cause of the osteomalacia.

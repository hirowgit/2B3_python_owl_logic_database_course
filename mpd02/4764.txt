The susceptibility of the marmoset Callithrix jacchus to Tacaribe virus infection
was investigated to perform cross-protection studies between Junin and Tacaribe
viruses. Five marmosets inoculated with Tacaribe virus failed to show any signs
of disease, any alterations in erythrocyte, leukocyte, reticulocyte, and platelet
counts or any changes in hematocrit or hemoglobin values. No Tacaribe virus could
be recovered from blood at any time postinfection. Anti-Tacaribe neutralizing
antibodies appeared 3 weeks postinfection. The five Tacaribe-infected marmosets
and four noninfected controls were challenged with the pathogenic strain of Junin
virus on day 60 post-Tacaribe infection. The former group showed no signs of
disease, no viremia, and no challenge virus replication, whereas the control
group exhibited the typical symptoms of Argentine hemorrhagic fever, high
viremia, and viral titers in organs. Soon after challenge, the Tacaribe-protected
marmosets synthesized neutralizing antibodies against Junin virus. These results 
indicate that the marmoset C. jacchus can be considered an experimental model for
protection studies with arenaviruses and that the Tacaribe virus could be
considered as a potential vaccine against Junin virus.

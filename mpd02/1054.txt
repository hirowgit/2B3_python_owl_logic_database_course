The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first isolated in
2012 from patients that died from severe pneumonia. It was another coronavirus
which resulted in severe infection of humans, apart from the severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus. The development of an appropriate animal model 
is necessary to study the pathogenesis and to evaluate the intervening measures
against MERS-CoV infection. To date, several small animals(e.g., mice, Syrian
hamsters, and ferrets) have been used to study MERS-CoV infection. In addition,
rhesus macaques, common marmosets, and dromedary camels were also utilized as the
models for MERS-CoV study. The purpose of this paper is to summarize the
advantages and disadvantages of the animal models mentioned above, to provide a
thorough understanding of the MERS-CoV study.

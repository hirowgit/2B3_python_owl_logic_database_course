A hepatitis A vaccine was prepared by formaldehyde inactivation of purified
hepatitis A virus (HAV) LSH/S strain grown on human diploid MRC-5 cells. The
vaccine was devoid of residual infectivity in vitro and failed to induce in
marmoset monkeys any pathological features or variations of haematological and
clinical chemistry values. Infectious HAV particles were not detected in faeces
and sera of the vaccinated primates by ELISA or after passages in MRC-5 cells.
The immunogenicity of the vaccine was evaluated by injecting guinea-pigs with
0.8, 0.2 or 0.05 micrograms of HAV antigen adsorbed onto 0.5 and 1 mg of Al (OH)3
or 0.3 mg of AlPO4. The antibody response, measured by a competitive
radioimmunoassay, was dose- and adjuvant-dependent. One injection of 0.2
micrograms of AlPO4-adsorbed HAV antigen induced seroconversion in 100% of
animals and high levels of specific and neutralizing serum antibodies. A further 
increase of antibody titres was observed after the second and third inoculations.
These results show that this vaccine formulation is safe and immunogenic in
animal models, and suggest that it should be evaluated further by human clinical 
studies.

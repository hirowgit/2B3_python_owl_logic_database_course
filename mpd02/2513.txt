Recently historians of medicine have proposed three distinctive accounts of early
history of Chagas disease (American trypasonomiasis). According to the first the 
disease, described by the Brazilian researcher Carlos Chagas in 1909, was
"deconstructed" in the 1920s and disappeared for about twenty years, then was
recovered in the 1940s, mainly through the epidemiological studies of Emmanuel
Dias and his colleagues in Minas Gerais (Brazil). According to the second Chagas 
disease could not be "deconstructed" in the 1920s because it did not exist at
that time. Chagas observations were inaccurate and unreliable and did not define 
a new human pathology. The entity called today "Chagas disease" appeared in the
1930, principally as the result of investigations of Cecilio Romaña in Argentina.
Finally, a third view assumes that "Chagas disease" was constructed gradually
between 1909 and the 1950s through the collective efforts of numerous
Latino-American researchers. This paper juxtaposes different histories of Chagas 
disease, and argues that their divergences stems from allegiance to distinct,
partly incommensurable epistemological "thought styles". The co-existence of
divergent styles of historical investigation, this text proposes, should be
perceived as potential source of enrichment of our understanding of the past.

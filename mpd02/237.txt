Comment in
    Nat Rev Neurosci. 2021 Jan;22(1):4-5.

Stress-related disorders such as depression and anxiety are characterized by
enhanced negative emotion and physiological dysfunction. Whilst elevated activity
within area 25 of the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC/25) has been
implicated in these illnesses, it is unknown whether this over-activity is
causal. By combining targeted intracerebral microinfusions with cardiovascular
and behavioral monitoring in marmosets, we show that over-activation of sgACC/25 
reduces vagal tone and heart rate variability, alters cortisol dynamics during
stress and heightens reactivity to proximal and distal threat. 18F-FDG PET
imaging shows these changes are accompanied by altered activity within a network 
of brain regions including the amygdala, hypothalamus and dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex. Ketamine, shown to have rapid antidepressant effects, fails to reverse
elevated arousal to distal threat contrary to the beneficial effects we have
previously demonstrated on over-activation induced reward blunting, illustrating 
the symptom-specificity of its actions.

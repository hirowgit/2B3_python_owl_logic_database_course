1. The fatty acid composition of different muscles, organs and blood components
of the marmoset monkey were examined after long-term feeding of several well
defined lipid supplemented diets. 2. Similarities between the fatty acid
composition of cardiac and skeletal muscles which persisted after all diets
suggest that biopsy of skeletal muscle may have an important diagnostic value in 
this and other primate species. 3. The relationship between the dietary intake of
individual fatty acids and their proportions in different tissues is both complex
and variable. 4. However, the lipid metabolism of Callithrix jacchus recommends
this small non-human primate as a most suitable species for the study of lipid
nutrition.

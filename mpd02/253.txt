Yellow Fever (YF) is a severe disease caused by Yellow Fever Virus (YFV), endemic
in some parts of Africa and America. In Brazil, YFV is maintained by a sylvatic
transmission cycle involving non-human primates (NHP) and forest canopy-dwelling 
mosquitoes, mainly Haemagogus-spp and Sabethes-spp. Beginning in 2016, Brazil
faced one of the largest Yellow Fever (YF) outbreaks in recent decades, mainly in
the southeastern region. In São Paulo city, YFV was detected in October 2017 in
Aloutta monkeys in an Atlantic Forest area. From 542 NHP, a total of 162 NHP were
YFV positive by RT-qPCR and/or immunohistochemistry, being 22 Callithrix-spp.
most from urban areas. Entomological collections executed did not detect the
presence of strictly sylvatic mosquitoes. Three mosquito pools were positive for 
YFV, 2 Haemagogus leucocelaenus, and 1 Aedes scapularis. In summary, YFV in the
São Paulo urban area was detected mainly in resident marmosets, and synanthropic 
mosquitoes were likely involved in viral transmission.

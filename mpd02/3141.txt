Long-term treatment of Parkinson's disease with levodopa is complicated by the
emergence of involuntary movements, known as levodopa-induced dyskinesia. It has 
been hypothesized that increased opioid transmission in striatal output pathways 
may be responsible for the generation of dyskinesia. In this study, we have
investigated the effect of blockade of opioid peptide transmission on
levodopa-induced dyskinesia in a primate model of Parkinson's disease-the
MPTP-lesioned marmoset. Coadministration of nonselective and mu- or
delta-subtype-selective opioid receptor antagonists with levodopa resulted in a
significant decrease in dyskinesia. There was no attenuation of the
anti-parkinsonian actions of levodopa. These data suggest that specific mu- or
delta-opioid receptor antagonists might be applicable clinically in the treatment
of levodopa-induced dyskinesia in Parkinson's disease.

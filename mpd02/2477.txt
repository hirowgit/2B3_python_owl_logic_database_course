Head-cocking of 15 infant marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) was scored from Day 1 to
60 of postnatal life, the growth period with overproduction of interneuronal
synapses. Head-cocking was scored during four 30 min intervals daily, including
angle of head-cocking and objects being fixated. Mean age of onset of
head-cocking was Day 13 (+/-1.3) and frequency increased to a fixed rate by Day
24-29, at the time of maturation of the foveal representation in layer 6 of the
visual cortex, thus lending further support to the importance of head-cocking to 
visual processing. The most common distance of objects fixated during
head-cocking was up to .5 m. Angle of head-cocking increased with age, and some
asymmetry of direction was noted. Fewer head-cocking events occurred in the
morning than in the afternoon. We also scored anogenital licking of offspring.
Head-cocking occurred at higher levels in marmosets receiving more anogenital
licking. As this was associated positively with increased exploration,
head-cocking may be regarded as an exploratory behavior.

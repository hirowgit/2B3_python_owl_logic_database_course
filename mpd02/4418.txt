Previous studies have shown that adult marmosets lack ocular dominance columns
(ODC) in area 17, but that ODCs can be demonstrated upon visual deprivation. The 
present results, obtained by transneuronal transport of WGA-HRP, indicate that
ODCs normally develop in juvenile marmosets but disappear before the animal
reaches maturity. The findings suggest that formation of ODCs during ontogenesis,
and their persistence through adulthood, are different developmental processes
depending on different mechanisms.

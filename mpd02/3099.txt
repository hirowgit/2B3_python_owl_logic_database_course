Neuropeptide Y-containing fibers/terminals were immunohistochemically detected in
the ventral portion of the marmoset suprachiasmatic nucleus, approximately
matching the distribution of its retinal afferents. On the other hand,
serotonergic fibers/terminals were found mostly in central and dorsal areas of
the suprachiasmatic nucleus, almost completely sparing its ventral portion. These
data may represent a morphological substrate for differential actions of
serotonin and neuropeptide Y in the control of circadian rhythmicity in
marmosets.

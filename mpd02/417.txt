Common marmosets have attracted considerable attention as a small standard
primate model in biomedical research. However, no marmoset diabetes model is
available. Here, we established a marmoset diabetes model via the combination of 
partial pancreatectomy and intravenous streptozotocin (STZ). A partial
pancreatectomy was performed in 11 common marmosets and multiple STZ doses were
intravenously administered. Diabetes was diagnosed upon sustained hyperglycaemia 
(nonfasting blood glucose level >200â€‰mg/dl). Blood glucose and biochemistry were 
periodically assessed, in addition to glucose tolerance testing, continual blood 
glucose determination using a continuous glucose monitoring system, urine testing
and histological evaluation. In 8 of the 11 animals (73%), diabetes mellitus was 
induced. The diabetic marmosets also showed abnormal intravenous and oral glucose
tolerance test results. Blood glucose levels decreased in response to human
insulin administration. The hyperglycaemic state was irreversible and persisted
for more than 3 months, and the animals' condition was manageable via daily
insulin administration. Thus, diabetes can be successfully induced and maintained
in the common marmoset via partial pancreatectomy and STZ administration. This
protocol effectively generates a valuable animal model for studying disease
pathogenesis, risk factors and therapeutic interventions, including islet
transplantation.

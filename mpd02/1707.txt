The development of biologic molecules (monoclonal antibodies, cytokines, soluble 
receptors) as specific therapeutics for human disease creates a need for animal
models in which safety and efficacy can be tested. Models in lower animal species
are precluded when the reagents fail to recognize their targets, which is often
the case in rats and mice. In this Feature article we will highlight the common
marmoset, a small-bodied nonhuman primate (NHP), as a useful model in biomedical 
and preclinical translational research.

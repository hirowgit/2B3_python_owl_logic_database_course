Two pair-housed, 1-y-old common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) had intermittent
loose feces and weight loss for approximately 2 mo. Cryptosporidum parvum was
identified by ELISA in the feces of both animals. CBC and blood chemistry values,
including liver enzymes, were within normal range. Both marmosets were treated
with the antibiotic paromomycin (15 mg/kg PO) twice daily for 28 d. Resolution of
clinical signs coincided with treatment. Three follow-up samples, taken 2 wk
apart after treatment was finished, were negative for cryptosporidium ELISA in
both animals. Paromomycin should be considered for treatment of cryptosporidiosis
in marmosets.

Kidney cells established in vitro from a white-lipped marmoset (106) were exposed
to N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) alone or in combination with
12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA). Low (0.1 micrograms/ml, 4 times),
intermediate (1 microgram/ml) and high (1 microgram/ml, 4 times) doses of MNNG
resulted in 100%, 50% and 2.8% of cell survival, respectively. High and low doses
of MNNG had no effect on cell transformation. Upon exposure of cells to an
intermediate dose of MNNG, 106 cells ecquired immortality and evolved into
permanent cell line, 106-1M. However, the cells retained normal morphology and
anchorage dependence. Chronic applications of TPA (0.1 micrograms/ml, 13 times)
promoted 106-1M cells to morphological transformation and anchorage-independent
growth but not to tumorigenicity in nude mice (106-1MT cell line). Chromosome
analysis revealed only numerical changes in 106 cells and both numerical and
structural aberrations in transformed 106-1MT cells. These changes in marmoset
cells usually reflected cell culture instability leading to either senescence or 
to longer survival of cells in vitro. Chronic treatment with TPA did not result
in downregulation of protein kinase C (PKC) in transformed 106-1MT cells.
Instead, an additional species of PKC appeared in these cells.

This study investigates the distribution of inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors
on sensory neurons. Ganglion cells in the retina of a New World monkey, the
common marmoset Callithrix jacchus, were injected with Lucifer yellow and
Neurobiotin and subsequently processed with antibodies against one (alpha1), or
against all subunits, of the glycine receptor, or against the anchoring protein
gephyrin. Immunoreactive (IR) puncta representing glycine receptor or gephyrin
clusters were found on the proximal and the distal dendrites of all ganglion cell
types investigated. For both parasol and midget cells, the density of receptor
clusters was greater on distal than proximal dendrites for all antibodies tested.
In parasol cells the average density for the alpha1 subunit of the glycine
receptor was 0.087 IR puncta/microm of dendrite, and for all subunits it was
0.119 IR puncta/microm of dendrite. Thus, the majority of glycine receptors on
parasol cells contain the alpha1 subunit. For parasol cells, we estimated an
average of 1.5 glycinergic synapses/100 microm2 dendritic membrane on proximal
dendrites and about 9.4 glycinergic synapses/100 microm2 on distal dendrites. The
segregation of receptors to the distal dendrites appears to be a common feature
of inhibitory neurotransmitter input to parasol and midget cells, and might be
associated with the receptive field surround mechanism.

The protein encoded by herpesvirus saimiri transforming gene STP-C488 was
identified and characterized. Antibodies were produced in rabbits by immunization
with keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated synthetic peptides specific for the
predicted sequence of STP-C488. STP-C488-encoded protein was detected in
recombinant Escherichia coli, transformed Rat-1 cells, transfected COS-1 cells,
and in common marmoset T lymphocytes immortalized by herpesvirus saimiri strain
488. STP-C488 protein was sensitive to treatment by bacterial collagenase,
consistent with the 18 uninterrupted collagenlike repeats predicted by the DNA
sequence. The apparent molecular size of STP-C488 in sodium dodecyl sulfate
(SDS)-polyacrylamide gels (20 to 22 kDa) was considerably larger than that
predicted from the DNA sequence (9.9 kDa). Using indirect immunofluorescence
tests and subcellular fractionation, STP-C488 was found to be membrane bound,
primarily in perinuclear compartments. The 18 uninterrupted collagenlike repeats,
sensitivity to collagenase, location in the cell, and anomalous migration through
SDS-polyacrylamide gels suggest an unusual, membrane-associated, fibrous
structure for this transforming herpesvirus oncoprotein.

During primate arboreal locomotion, substrate orientation modifies body axis
orientation and biomechanical contribution of fore- and hindlimbs. To
characterize the role of cortical oscillations in integrating these locomotor
demands, we recorded electrocorticographic activity from left dorsal premotor,
primary motor, and supplementary motor cortices of three common marmosets moving 
across a branch-like small-diameter pole, fixed horizontally or vertically.
Animals displayed behavioral adjustments to the task, namely, the horizontal
condition mainly induced quadrupedal walk with pronated/neutral forelimb
postures, whereas the vertical condition induced walk and bound gaits with
supinated/neutral postures. Examination of cortical activity suggests that β
(16-35 Hz) and γ (75-100 Hz) oscillations could reflect different processes in
locomotor adjustments. During task, modulation of γ ERS by substrate orientation 
(horizontal/vertical) and epoch (preparation/execution) suggests close tuning to 
movement dynamics and biomechanical demands. β ERD was essentially modulated by
gait (walk/bound), which could illustrate contribution to movement sequence and
coordination. At rest, modulation of β power by substrate orientation underlines 
its role in sensorimotor processes for postural maintenance.

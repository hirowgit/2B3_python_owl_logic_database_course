The common marmoset has been proposed as a potential alternative to macaque
monkey as a primate model for neuroscience and medical research. Here, we have
newly developed a stereotaxic neuronal recording system for awake marmosets under
the head-fixed condition by modifying that for macaque monkeys. Using this
system, we recorded neuronal activity in the cerebral cortex of awake marmosets
and successfully identified the primary motor cortex by intracortical
microstimulation. Neuronal activities of deep brain structures, such as the basal
ganglia, thalamus, and cerebellum, in awake marmosets were also successfully
recorded referring to magnetic resonance images. Our system is suitable for
functional mapping of the brain, since the large recording chamber allows access 
to arbitrary regions over almost the entire brain, and the recording electrode
can be easily moved stereotaxically from one site to another. In addition, our
system is desirable for neuronal recording during task performance to assess
motor skills and cognitive function, as the marmoset sits in the marmoset chair
and can freely use its hands. Moreover, our system can be used in combination
with cutting-edge techniques, such as two-photon imaging and optogenetic
manipulation. This recording system will contribute to boosting neuroscience and 
medical research using marmosets.

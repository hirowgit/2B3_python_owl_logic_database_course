Interest in the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) as a primate model animal
has grown recently, in part due to the successful demonstration of transgenic
marmosets. However, there is some debate as to the suitability of marmosets,
compared to more widely used animal models, such as the macaque monkey and mouse.
Especially, the usage of marmoset for animal models of human cognition and mental
disorders, is still yet to be fully explored. To examine the prospects of the
marmoset model for neuroscience research, the Marmoset Gene Atlas
(https://gene-atlas.bminds.brain.riken.jp/) provides a whole brain gene
expression atlas in the common marmoset. We employ in situ hybridization (ISH) to
systematically analyze gene expression in neonate marmoset brains, which allows
us to compare expression with other model animals such as mouse. We anticipate
that these data will provide sufficient information to develop tools that enable 
us to reveal marmoset brain structure, function, cellular and molecular
organization for primate brain research.

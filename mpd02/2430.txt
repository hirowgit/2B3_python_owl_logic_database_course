We examined muscle spindles in the posterior cricoarytenoid (PCA) muscle of the
marmoset. The spindle capsule contained only one intrafusal muscle fiber which
did not form a typical aggregation of equatorial nuclei such as bags and chains. 
The intrafusal fiber was innervated by sensory endings which branched and
arranged irregularly. These sensory endings lay on the surface of the fiber in
shallow grooves or deeply penetrated into it. These findings suggest that the
muscle spindles in the marmoset PCA muscle are strikingly different in the
structure of intrafusal fibers in the arrangement of sensory endings from those
in common mammalian skeletal muscles.

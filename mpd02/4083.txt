Antisera were raised in rabbits against five synthetic peptides. These peptides
have been identified as potentially antigenic epitopes from the sequence of
porcine choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) using primary and secondary structure
analysis. All five antisera recognized immunoaffinity-purified antigen from
porcine brain in an ELISA and on western blots. Four antisera recognized ChAT on 
dot blots, and another four antisera reacted with native and degraded enzyme in a
sandwich ELISA using monoclonal antibodies as the capture antibody. One peptide
antiserum was of similar avidity in this sandwich ELISA as a polyclonal antibody 
raised against immunoaffinity-purified ChAT. The same antiserum reacted with the 
enzyme from human placenta in an ELISA and on western and dot blots and
recognized ChAT in rat, primate, and human neurons. Thus, a single peptide (amino
acids 168-189) provides the means for easy, reliable, and reproducible generation
of antibodies against ChAT suitable for replacing conventional polyclonal and
monoclonal antibodies.

Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating condition with no established
treatment. To better understand the pathology and develop a treatment modality
for SCI, an understanding of the physiological changes following SCI at the
molecular level is essential. However, studies on SCI have primarily used rodent 
models, and few studies have examined SCI in non-human primates. In this study,
we analyzed the temporal changes in gene expression patterns following SCI in
common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) using microarray analysis and mRNA deep
sequencing. This analysis revealed that, although the sequence of events is
comparable between primates and rodents, the inflammatory response following SCI 
is significantly prolonged and the onset of glial scar formation is temporally
delayed in primates compared with rodents. These observations indicate that the
optimal time window to treat SCI significantly differs among different species.
This study provides the first extensive analysis of gene expression following SCI
in non-human primates and will serve as a valuable resource in understanding the 
pathology of SCI.

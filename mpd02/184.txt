Common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) were shown to be susceptible to
inhalational infection with Coxiella burnetii, in a dose-dependent manner,
producing a disease similar to human Q fever, characterized by a resolving
febrile response. Illness was also associated with weight loss, liver enzyme
dysfunction, characteristic cellular activation, circulating INF-γ and
bacteraemia. Viable C. burnetii was recovered from various tissues during disease
and from 75% of the animal's lungs on 28 days post challenge, when there were no 
overt clinical features of disease but there was histological evidence of
macrophage and lymphocyte infiltration into the lung resulting in granulomatous
alveolitis. Taken together, these features of disease progression, physiology and
bacterial spread appear to be consistent with human disease and therefore the
common marmoset can be considered as a suitable model for studies on the
pathogenesis or the development of medical counter measures of inhalational Q
fever.

Placental transfer of hexachlorophene (HCP) in the marmoset monkey (Callithrix
jacchus).

Brandt I, Dencker L, Larsson KS, Siddall RA.

Autoradiography was used to study the distribution of
2,2'-14C-methylene-bis-(3,4,6-trichlorophenol) (HCP) in pregnant marmoset monkeys
in early (day 30-50) and late (around day 120) gestation and in a newborn (11
days old) pup. Radioactivity was present in the conceptus at all stages of
gestation, although the foetal concentration was lower than the maternal. In the 
embryo an accumulation was observed in the neural tube and in the embryonic
membranes. In the late foetus and newborn monkey the highest concentration of
radioactivity was found in the liver and the intestinal contents. The brain of
the adult and newborn animals showed low concentration. A partial blood-brain
barrier was present in the late foetus but, in relation to other tissues, the
foetal brain concentration was higher than that of the mother.

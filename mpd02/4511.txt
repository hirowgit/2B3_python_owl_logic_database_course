Controlled ovulation in the marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus) with human
chorionic gonadotropin following prostaglandin-induced luteal regression.

Controlled induction of ovulation in the marmoset monkey was attempted with a
single injection of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG; 50 IU) given on day 7
after prostaglandin-induced luteal regression. Animals given hCG (n = 12)
ovulated within a 2-day period (days 9 and 10 after prostaglandin) compared with 
a 4-day period (days 9 to 12) in the control group (n = 12). The mean interval to
ovulation was similar in both groups. There was no difference in the timing of
the preovulatory estradiol (E2) peak between groups, although E2 levels on the
day of hCG injection were lower than in controls on the day of the onset of the
luteinizing hormone surge. All animals given hCG ovulated and 11 of 12 became
pregnant. Ten of 11 embryos recovered surgically from six of these animals were
normal blastocysts; 5 of the remaining 6 animals carried pregnancies to term. The
results are of practical importance for experiments involving follicular and
oocyte maturation and the collection and transfer of embryos.

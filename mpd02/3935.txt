About 58.3 km of transects were surveyed throughout 21,800 ha of an Atlantic
forest reserve of southeastern Brazil, yielding habitat preference data and
density estimates for three of the four primate species present. The densities
were calculated using the "Fourier Series Estimator" and were 10.5, 2.2 and 1.2
groups/km2 for Callithrix geoffroyi, Cebus apella robustus and Callicebus
personatus personatus, respectively. Alouatta fusca fusca although present, was
not seen during the survey. C. geoffroyi was spotted predominantly in the low
strata of secondary forests while C. a. robustus preferred the higher strata of
primary forests. The encounters with C. p. personatus were rarer but the species 
seems to occur in the middle strata of both primary and secondary forests. Local 
populations were estimated at 1644, 344 and 181 groups for these three species,
respectively. With the exception of A. f. fusca which seems to occur at extremely
low numbers, the densities for the other species are within the range of reported
values for other species of these genera.

Plasma total lipid, cholesterol, all-trans retinol (vitamin A) and
alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E) concentrations, and the susceptibility of
erythrocytes to hydrogen peroxide-induced haemolysis in vitro were investigated
in healthy laboratory-bred common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus). The
concentrations of alpha-tocopherol and total cholesterol were similar to those of
control human subjects. The mean lipid concentration was higher (P less than
0.025) and the retinol concentration lower (P less than 0.001) in the marmosets. 
The susceptibility of the erythrocytes of the marmosets to hydrogen
peroxide-induced haemolysis was high, both in absolute value and relative to the 
controls. Changes in phospholipid and fatty acid composition might have rendered 
the red cells susceptible to oxidative stress.

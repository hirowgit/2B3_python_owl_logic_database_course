The use of Rhodamin B for the identification of injected horseradish peroxidase
in the brain.

Schwerdtfeger WK.

Horseradish peroxidase injected into the brain of the marmoset, Callithrix
jacchus, is demonstrated by fluorescence microscopy following histochemical
reaction with homovanillic acid and Rhodamin B. Usefulness and efficiency of the 
method are discussed in comparison with other procedures for the demonstration of
HRP.

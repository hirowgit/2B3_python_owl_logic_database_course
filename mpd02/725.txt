The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) represents a promising nonhuman primate 
model for the study of human diseases because of its small size, ease of
handling, and availability of gene-modified animals. Here, we aimed to devise
reproductive technology for marmoset spermatid injection using immature males for
a possible rapid generational turnover. Spermatids at each step could be
identified easily by their morphology under differential interference microscopy:
thus, early round spermatids had a round nucleus with a few nucleolus-like
structures and abundant cytoplasm, as in other mammals. The spermatids acquired
oocyte-activating capacity at the late round spermatid stage, as confirmed by the
resumption of meiosis and Ca2+ oscillations upon injection into mouse oocytes.
The spermatids could be cryopreserved efficiently with a simple medium containing
glycerol and CELL BANKER®. Late round or elongated spermatids first appeared at
10-12 months of age, 6-8 months before sexual maturation. Marmoset oocytes
microinjected with frozen-thawed late round or elongated spermatids retrieved
from a 12-month-old male marmoset developed to the 8-cell stage without the need 
for artificial oocyte activation stimulation. Thus, it might be possible to
shorten the intergeneration time by spermatid injection, from 2 years (by natural
mating) to 13-15 months including gestation.

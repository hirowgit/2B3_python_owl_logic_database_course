The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) glycoprotein gp85 is the EBV gH homologue and is
thought to be involved in penetration of virus through the B-cell membrane.
However, although the glycoprotein is functionally important, it is found in very
low abundance in infected cells and in the virion. To facilitate analysis of the 
structure and function of gp85, recombinant vaccinia viruses were constructed to 
express the glycoprotein. Recombinant gp85 was recognized by polyclonal antibody 
made to a peptide derived from the gp85 sequence, but not by monoclonal
antibodies that reacted with the native molecule. Unlike native gp85, the
recombinant protein contained no sugars that were resistant to endoglycosidase H 
and it was not transported to the cell surface. The native protein was found to
be associated with two additional glycoproteins with apparent M(r) of 25,000 and 
42,000. Antibody made to a peptide derived from a sequence in the BKRF2 open
reading frame immunoprecipitated glycoproteins with the mobilities of gp85 and
its associated 25,000-Da molecule. These data suggest that the BKRF2 gene
product, like that encoded by its positional homologues gL of herpes simplex
virus and the UL115 gene product of human cytomegalovirus, associates with gp85
and may be required for glycoprotein processing.

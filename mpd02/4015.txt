In a previous study we observed the processes determining the cellular death in
nigral neurons of Macaca fascicularis and common Marmoset treated with MPTP. The 
purpose of this study is to consider, in substantia nigra neurons of the same
animals, mitochondrial abnormalities caused by neurotoxin. Three Macaca
fascicularis and 5 common Marmosets, respectively treated with 3 and 4 mg/kg of
MPTP dissolved in saline + 10% ethanol, were suppressed by means of an i.v.
injection phenobarbital. The substantia nigra, isolated from the mesencephalon,
has been examined under Electron Microscope. Different mitochondrial
abnormalities have been observed in nigral neurons: crystal abnormalities occur
more frequently than other alterations. They are correlated with various degrees 
of mitochondrial enlargement. Dissolution of the matrix induces formation of
spherical highly electron-dense inclusions of various volume and in different
number; they are probably lipoprotein. Laminar bodies and myelin-like figures are
determined by alterations of the external membrane. Particular roundish
organules, placed near normal mitochondria, are limited by fragments of membrane 
with a granular material, occasionally flowing in the cytoplasm. The biochemical 
hypothesis concerning the genesis of the observed abnormalities is discussed in
the present study.

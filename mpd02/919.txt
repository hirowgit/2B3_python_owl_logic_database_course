To elucidate the forelimb phylogeny of primates, anatomical analysis of the
brachial plexus in platyrrhines is beneficial. In the present study, six brachial
plexuses and the surrounding arteries of four common marmosets were dissected. In
five specimens, the brachial plexus consisted of five ventral rami from the fifth
cervical nerve (C5) to the first thoracic nerve (T1). In one specimen, the
ventral ramus of the fourth cervical nerve joined with the brachial plexus. In
five specimens, the upper trunk was composed of C5 and the sixth cervical nerve
(C6). In one specimen, the ventral division of C6 merged with the ventral branch 
of the middle trunk to constitute the lateral cord. The seventh cervical nerve
constituted the middle trunk, and the eighth cervical nerve and T1 formed the
lower trunk in all specimens. The lateral cord gave rise to the musculocutaneous 
nerve, and the remaining component merged with the medial cord. The confluence of
the lateral and medial cords immediately bifurcated into the median and ulnar
nerves. These branching patterns of the musculocutaneous, median, and ulnar
nerves were consistent and similar to the human counterparts. In the dorsal
division, the single posterior cord as observed in the human brachial plexus was 
not observed. The axillary artery did not pass between the medial and lateral
roots of the median nerve, and the axillary artery bifurcated into the brachial
artery and the superficial brachial artery. Anat Rec, 300:1299-1306, 2017. © 2017

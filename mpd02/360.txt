To effectively use a common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) as an experimental
animal species, it is critical to establish a normal characteristics and
morphology of the organs of the common marmoset. Although gross morphology of the
common marmoset heart is reportedly the same as that of humans, little
information is available regarding detailed morphology of the right atrium and
the interatrial septum. Heart specimens were collected from three male and 10
female marmosets aged 9 to 65 months to determine the morphological features of
the right atrium and the interatrial septum. Ten specimens were evaluated
morphologically with a stereoscopic microscope in accordance with preparation and
investigation methods designed to facilitate evaluation. Three specimens were
histologically evaluated after being stained with hematoxylin-eosin, Elastica van
Gieson and periodic acid Schiff. An annular ridge that is not present in the
human heart was present in the right atrium and the interatrial septum of the
common marmoset hearts. Tissue structure of the annular ridge was similar to
atrial myocardial fibers. Furthermore, location of the coronary sinus ostium was 
different to that in humans. Present findings were used to create a schematic
view of the annular ridge in the common marmoset heart. In the common marmoset
heart, the annular ridge may function as a valve of the superior vena cava
ostium, inferior vena cava ostium, and coronary sinus ostium. Present study
provides morphological evidence that common marmosets have a valve-like structure
in the right atrium.

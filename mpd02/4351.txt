Recently it has been found that the two monkey species Callithrix jacchus and
Saguinus fuscicollis, both belonging to the same New World monkey family
Callitrichidae and held in the same colony under identical conditions, had
extremely different serum ascorbate levels. To examine the ascorbic acid
metabolism the 14C-excretion of orally given 1-14C-ascorbic acid was studied
under conditions of marginal and abundant vitamin C supply and under intentional 
stress. There were large differences in the mode of 14C excretion between low and
high ascorbate supply. The differences were smaller between stress/no stress
conditions intraindividually than between the two species, but they were in the
same manner. In comparable trials S. fuscicollis reacted such that a higher
status of stress can be supposed in this species.

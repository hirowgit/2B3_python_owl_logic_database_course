The authors investigated the development of unimanual hand use and hand
preferences during feeding in 15 marmosets (Callithrix jacchus), ages birth to
51-70 months. Bimanual hand use was common at 1-2 months, but by 5-8 months
unimanual holding had developed and so had significant hand preferences. Half of 
the marmosets preferred to pick up and take food to the mouth with the left hand,
and half preferred the right hand. Individuals maintained the same hand
preference at all ages examined. Significant relationships were also found
between the postures adopted during feeding and the direction of hand preferences
displayed by juvenile marmosets. There was a positive correlation between
increased suspension and increased left-hand preference, and a negative
correlation between increased feeding in a tripedal posture and increased
left-hand preference. These results are discussed in terms of motor development
and hemispheric specialization.

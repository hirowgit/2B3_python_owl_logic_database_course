BACKGROUND: The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) has been proposed as a
suitable bridge between rodents and larger primates. They have been used in
several types of research including auditory, vocal, visual, pharmacological and 
genetics studies. However, marmosets have not been used as much for behavioral
studies.
NEW METHOD: Here we present data from training 12 adult marmosets for behavioral 
neuroscience studies. We discuss the husbandry, food preferences, handling,
acclimation to laboratory environments and neurosurgical techniques. In this
paper, we also present a custom built "scoop" and a monkey chair suitable for
training of these animals.
RESULTS: The animals were trained for three tasks: 4 target center-out reaching
task, reaching tasks that involved controlling robot actions, and touch screen
task. All animals learned the center-out reaching task within 1-2 weeks whereas
learning reaching tasks controlling robot actions task took several months of
behavioral training where the monkeys learned to associate robot actions with
food rewards.
COMPARISON TO EXISTING METHOD: We propose the marmoset as a novel model for
behavioral neuroscience research as an alternate for larger primate models. This 
is due to the ease of handling, quick reproduction, available neuroanatomy,
sensorimotor system similar to larger primates and humans, and a lissencephalic
brain that can enable implantation of microelectrode arrays relatively easier at 
various cortical locations compared to larger primates.
CONCLUSION: All animals were able to learn behavioral tasks well and we present
the marmosets as an alternate model for simple behavioral neuroscience tasks.

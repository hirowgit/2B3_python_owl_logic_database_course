Myelin sheaths are formed around axons by extending, biochemically modifying and 
spiraling plasma membranes of Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system
(PNS) and oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system (CNS). Because
glycoproteins are prominent components of plasma membranes, it is not surprising 
that they have important roles in the formation, maintenance and degeneration of 
myelin sheaths. The emphasis in this review is on four integral membrane
glycoproteins. Two of them, protein zero (P0) and peripheral myelin protein-22
(PMP-22), are components of compact PNS myelin. The other two are preferentially 
localized in membranes of sheaths that are distinct from compact myelin. One is
the myelin-associated glycoprotein, which is localized at the inside of sheaths
where it functions in glia-axon interactions in both the PNS and CNS. The other
is the myelin-oligodendrocyte glycoprotein, which is preferentially localized on 
the outside of CNS myelin sheaths and appears to be an important target antigen
in autoimmune demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis.

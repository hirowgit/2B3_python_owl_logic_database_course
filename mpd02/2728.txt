The marmoset adrenal is interesting as it is developmentally similar to humans
and other primates, but in adulthood 17,20-lyase activity is very low. One
possible explanation is an altered regulation of P450c17 expression by AT1-R. We 
investigated the expression and zonal distribution of the AT1-R in marmoset
adrenal glands and adrenocortical cells in culture since it is known that AT1-R
is a regulator of P450c17 expression and activity. AT1-R was expressed strongly
in the ZG and to diminishing degrees through the remainder of the cortex. There
was negative expression in a putative ZI. Dispersed adrenocortical cells retained
AT1-R protein as detected by ICC. Cells cultured for several days and treated in 
serum-free media for 48 h maintained AT1-R expression, as measured by western.
However, at that 48 h time point, treatment with Forsk, AII, TPA, or the
combination of A+F or T+F did not appear to effect AT1-R expression. We conclude 
that marmoset adrenals express AT1-R similarly to humans and other higher
mammals, adrenocortical cells retain AT1-R expression in culture, and consistent 
with other adrenal cell culture models, AT1-R expression is not lost in response 
to agonists long term.

In normal common marmosets administration of the D-1/D-2 agonist apomorphine or
the selective D-2 agonist quinpirole caused a dose-dependent increase in motor
activity and induced stereotyped behaviour. Both the selective D-2 antagonist
raclopride and the selective D-1 antagonist SCH 23390 inhibited normal locomotor 
activity and induced catalepsy. Quinpirole- and apomorphine-induced motor
activity were potently inhibited by pretreatment with raclopride. The effects of 
quinpirole, but not apomorphine, were weakly inhibited by SCH 23390. The
selective D-1 partial agonist SKF 38393 decreased motor activity and did not
induce grooming, oral movements or other behaviours. SKF 38393 inhibited motor
activity induced by the administration of quinpirole but did not alter
apomorphine-induced motor behaviour. Locomotor activity in normal common
marmosets appears to be mediated mainly via D-2 systems. In contrast to rodents, 
administration of SKF 38393 does not induce behavioural activation and there does
not appear to be a facilitating effect of D-1 systems on D-2 function in the
normal common marmoset. However, the ability of both SKF 38393 and SCH 23390 to
inhibit quinpirole locomotor activity suggests some interaction between D-1 and
D-2 systems to occur in this species.

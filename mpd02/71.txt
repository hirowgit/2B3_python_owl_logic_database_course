PURPOSE: Antagonising serotonin (5-HT) type 2A receptors (5-HT2AR) is an
effective strategy to alleviate both dyskinesia and psychosis in Parkinson's
disease (PD). We have recently shown that activation of metabotropic glutamate 2 
receptors (mGluR2), via either orthosteric stimulation or positive allosteric
modulation, enhances the anti-dyskinetic and anti-psychotic effects of 5-HT2AR
antagonism. Here, we investigated if greater therapeutic efficacy would be
achieved by combining 5-HT2AR antagonism with concurrent mGluR2 orthosteric
stimulation and mGluR2 positive allosteric modulation.
METHODS: Five 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-lesioned
marmosets exhibiting dyskinesia and psychosis-like behaviours (PLBs) were
administered L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) in combination with vehicle or
the 5-HT2AR antagonist EMD-281,014. EMD-281,014 was itself administered alone or 
with the mGluR2 orthosteric agonist (OA) LY-354,740, the mGluR2 positive
allosteric modulator (PAM) LY-487,379 and combination thereof, after which the
severity of dyskinesia, PLBs and parkinsonism was rated.
RESULTS: EMD-281,014 reduced dyskinesia and PLBs by up to 47% and 40%,
respectively (both P < 0.001). The addition of LY-354,740, LY-487,379 and
LY-354,740/LY-487,379 decreased dyskinesia by 56%, 65% and 77%, while PLBs were
diminished by 55%, 63% and 71% (all P < 0.001). All treatment combinations
provided anti-dyskinetic and anti-psychotic benefits significantly greater than
those conferred by EMD-281,014 alone (all P < 0.05). The combination of
EMD-281,014/LY-354,740/LY-487,379 resulted in anti-dyskinetic and anti-psychotic 
effects significantly greater than those conferred by EMD-281,014 with either
LY-354,740 or LY-487,379 (both P < 0.05). No deleterious effects on L-DOPA
anti-parkinsonian action were observed.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that combining 5-HT2AR antagonism with mGluR2
activation results in greater reduction of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia and PD
psychosis. They also indicate that further additive effect can be achieved when a
mGluR2 OA and a mGluR2 PAM are combined with a 5-HT2AR antagonist than when a
mGluR2 OA or a mGluR2 PAM are added to a 5-HT2AR antagonist.

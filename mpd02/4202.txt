Two series of cephalosporins A and B have been synthesized, bearing at C-3'
catechols substituted with various electron withdrawing groups (Y) and differing 
links (X), and were evaluated for their in vitro antibacterial activity and their
pharmacokinetics in marmosets. Compounds in series A, bearing an isobutyric oxime
substituent, proved to be highly active against Gram-negative organisms and were 
especially noteworthy for showing long elimination phase (beta) half-lives in
marmosets. It was established that introduction of electron withdrawing
substituents greatly increased the beta half-lives of compounds (5, X = NHCO, Y =
H, t1/2 = 1.25 h, AUC = 27 mg/h per L; 11, X = NHCO, Y = 5-Cl, t1/2 = 4.5 h, AUC 
= 638 mg/h per L) and that the nature of the link also influenced t1/2, the
highest values being obtained when X = NHCO and OCO. Acidities (pKa values) of
the substituted catechols were measured, and relationships between the acidities 
and half-lives were evaluated. Thus it was established that the more acidic
catechols gave the longest half-lives (12, X = NHCO, Y = 2,5-Cl2, t1/2 = 8.2 h,
AUC = 461 mg/h per L). Further elaboration of the catechol to bicyclic systems
maintained good pharmacokinetics when the pKa was sufficiently acidic.

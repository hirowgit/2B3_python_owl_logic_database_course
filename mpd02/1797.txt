Perception-based measures often reveal much earlier competencies than
action-based approaches. We explored this phenomenon generally labeled as
"knowledge dissociation" in 28 common marmoset monkeys (Callithrix jacchus) using
a paradigm where subjects had to localize a food item dropped down an opaque
tube. Experiments 1 and 2 assessed common marmoset monkeys' gravity bias in an
action based version of the tubes task. Experiments 3 and 4 investigated whether 
marmosets' performance increases in an action-free task context where they simply
look at objects falling down a tube. The results suggest that common marmosets
have some intuition of continuity/solidity constraints when tested with
perception based measures even though these principles do not appear to guide
their search for falling objects.

The behavior of a free-ranging group of buffy-headed marmosets (Callithrix
flaviceps) was observed in detail over a five-month period following the birth of
twins. Infant care, principally carrying and food sharing, were analyzed and the 
variation both between age-sex classes and through time investigated. Potentially
reproductive males exhibited a relatively high degree of interest in the infants 
during the first week following birth, but their provision of care was otherwise 
little different from that of other group members. The data are considered in
relation to the factors stimulating care-giving behavior and possible differences
between callitrichid genera are discussed.

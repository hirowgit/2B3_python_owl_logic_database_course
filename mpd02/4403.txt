The renin inhibitor CGP 29,287 was administered continuously for 7 days (30 mg/kg
per day, intraperitoneally, via osmotic minipumps) to normotensive marmosets fed 
a low-salt diet. As a control, another group of marmosets was given vehicle only.
After 7 days of treatment, the mean arterial blood pressure of the CGP
29,287-treated marmosets was significantly lowered by about 23 mmHg. Plasma
immunoreactive total and active renin were increased 10- and sevenfold,
respectively, whereas plasma renin activity (PRA) was reduced by 95%. Plasma
angiotensin II (Ang II) and aldosterone were also reduced (by 97 and 85%,
respectively). Serum angiotensin converting enzyme activity was unchanged and
there were no differences in plasma concentrations of electrolytes, urea or
creatinine between CGP 29,287-treated and control marmosets. These results
indicate that although renin release is markedly stimulated after continuous
administration of a renin inhibitor for 7 days, the formation of Ang II and
aldosterone, the active hormones of the renin-angiotensin system, is
substantially reduced.

Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), an important method used to treat male
subfertility, is applied in the transgenic technology of sperm-mediated gene
transfer. However, no study has described successful generation of offspring
using ICSI in the common marmoset, a small non-human primate used as a model for 
biomedical translational research. In this study, we investigated blastocyst
development and the subsequent live offspring stages of marmoset oocytes matured 
in vitro and fertilized by ICSI. To investigate the optimal timing of performing 
ICSI, corrected immature oocytes were matured in vitro and ICSI was performed at 
various time points (1-2 h, 2-4 h, 4-6 h, 6-8 h, and 8-10 h after extrusion of
the first polar body (PB)). Matured oocytes were then divided randomly into two
groups: one was used for in vitro fertilization (IVF) and the other for ICSI. To 
investigate in vivo development of embryos followed by ICSI, 6-cell- to
8-cell-stage embryos and blastocysts were nonsurgically transferred into
recipient marmosets. Although no significant differences were observed in the
fertilization rate of blastocysts among ICSI timing after the first PB extrusion,
the blastocyst rate at 1-2 h was lowest among groups at 2-4 h, 4-6 h, 6-8 h, and 
8-10 h. Comparing ICSI to IVF, the fertilization rates obtained in ICSI were
higher than in IVF (p>0.05). No significant difference was noted in the cleaved
blastocyst rate between ICSI and IVF. Following the transfer of 37 ICSI
blastocysts, 4 of 20 recipients became pregnant, while with the transfer of 21
6-cell- to 8-cell-stage ICSI embryos, 3 of 8 recipients became pregnant. Four
healthy offspring were produced and grew normally. These are the first marmoset
offspring produced by ICSI, making it an effective fertilization method for
marmosets.

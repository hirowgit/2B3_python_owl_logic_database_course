BACKGROUND: Like other herpes viruses, latent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection 
can be reactivated to lytic replication. Reactivation can be achieved by
treatment with various reagents, including tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate (TPA)
and Ca2+ ionophores. Relatively little is known about the physiological factors
related to reactivation of EBV. Previous studies have demonstrated that G0/G1
cell cycle arrest is associated with EBV activation, and that hypoxic conditions 
can induce cell cycle arrest. In the present study we investigated the effect of 
hypoxia on reactivation of EBV.
OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: Hypoxic culture conditions were established and the
expression of Zta protein and the number of EBV DNA copies were measured in B95-8
cells maintained under these conditions.
RESULTS: Hypoxia treatment not only increased the expression of the EBV
immediate-early protein Zta (which mediates the switch between the latent and
lytic form of infection), but also increased the number of EBV DNA copies in
B95-8 cells.
CONCLUSIONS: EBV in latent infection can be activated to lytic infection by
hypoxia treatment.

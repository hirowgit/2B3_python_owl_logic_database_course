Vocalizations are a dominant means of communication for numerous species,
including nonhuman primates. These acoustic signals are encoded with a rich array
of information available to signal receivers that can be used to guide
species-typical behaviors. In this study, we examined the communicative content
of common marmoset phee calls, the species-typical long distance contact call,
during antiphonal calling. This call type has a relatively stereotyped acoustic
structure, consisting of a series of long tonal pulses. Analyses revealed that
calls could be reliably classified based on the individual identity and social
group of the caller. Our analyses did not, however, correctly classify phee calls
recorded under different social contexts, although differences were evident along
individual acoustic parameters. Further tests of antiphonal calling interactions 
showed that spontaneously produced phee calls differ from antiphonal phee calls
in their peak and end frequency, which may be functionally significant. Overall, 
this study shows that the marmoset phee call has a rich communicative content
encoded in its acoustic structure available to conspecifics during antiphonal
calling exchanges.

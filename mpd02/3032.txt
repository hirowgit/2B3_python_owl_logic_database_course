BACKGROUND: Materno-fetal transfer of intravenously administered liposome-plasmid
DNA complexes has been demonstrated only in mice. Studies on its materno-fetal
transfer in the pregnant monkey model is needed because of critical differences
in placental structure between primates including humans and rodents.
METHODS: The reporter plasmid pEGFP-C1 was formulated in cationic lipid
containing polybrene and vesicular stomatitis virus G protein. The fusogenic
liposome-plasmid DNA complexes were intradermally injected into pregnant common
marmosets (N=2), a New World monkey, near term. DNA extracted from fetal tissues 
was subjected to PCR for detection of the egfp gene. Confocal microscopy and
immunostaining were performed to determine the sites of transgene expression in
the fetal organs.
RESULTS: The egfp gene was detected in fetal blood and major organs (heart,
liver, lung). The encoded protein was mainly produced in the endothelial cells of
blood vessels in the fetal lungs.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report on materno-fetal transfer of intradermally 
administered fusogenic liposome-plasmid DNA complexes and fetal expression of a
transgene in primates.

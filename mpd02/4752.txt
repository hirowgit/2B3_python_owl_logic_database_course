Skin reaction in Callithrix jacchus penicillata to phytohemagglutinin.

Cardoso RR, Magalhaes-Castro B, Alves C Jr.

Sixty marmosets (Callithrix jacchus penicillata) were intradermally tested with
phytohemagglutinin. It was possible to classify this population into three groups
on the basis of the reactions: 1. negatives, 2. those which showed just local
hemorrhage, and finally 3. a group which developed a wheal as well as hemorrhage.
The biopsy at the site of the reaction demonstrated several microscopic foci.
This finding contrasted with the homogeneous cellular infiltration found in the
human controls.

We have systematically studied the effects of varying the central unnatural amino
acid moiety on CGRP receptor antagonist potency and CYP inhibition in a series of
ureidoamides. In this Letter, we report the discovery of compound 23, a potent
CGRP receptor antagonist with only weak CYP3A4 inhibition. Unlike the triptans,
compound 23 did not cause active constriction of ex vivo human cerebral arteries.
At doses of 0.3-1 mg/kg (s.c.), 23 showed robust inhibition of CGRP-induced
increases in marmoset facial blood flow, a validated migraine model. Ureidoamide 
23 derives from a novel amino acid, 1H-indazol-5-yl substituted alanine as a
tyrosine surrogate.

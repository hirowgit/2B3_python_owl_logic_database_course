The number of neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) is, across primate
species, related to the number of neurons in the visual thalamus (the lateral
geniculate nucleus [LGN]) by a power law with an exponent of 3/2. This
evolutionary scaling law is explained by a simple relation according to which the
fineness of resolution in cortex is related to the number of neurons in the area 
of cortex used to process the information from a single point of light (the
point-spread area). The same theory provides a link between two functional
properties of the visual cortex, the areal cortical magnification factor (ACMF)
and the receptive field (RF) area.

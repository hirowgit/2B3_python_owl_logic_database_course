BACKGROUND: Animal models of human brain disorders often have to rely on
non-human primates because of their immunological, physiological, and cognitive
similarities to humans.
METHODS: Localized proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy was performed to assess
cerebral metabolite profiles of male common marmoset monkeys in vivo and to
determine putative alterations of adult brain metabolism in response to
intrauterine hyperexposure to the synthetic glucocorticoid hormone dexamethasone.
RESULTS: Excellent spectral quality allowed for absolute quantification of the
concentrations of major metabolites in predominantly white matter, gray matter,
and thalamus. Marmoset monkeys intrauterinely hyperexposed to dexamethasone
revealed normal neurochemical profiles at adulthood.
CONCLUSIONS: Prenatally applied dexamethasone does not lead to persistent
metabolic alterations affecting adult brain integrity.

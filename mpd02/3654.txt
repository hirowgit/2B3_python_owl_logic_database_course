We have studied the effects of two D2 dopamine receptor-selective compounds,
(-)-OSU 6162 and raclopride, on levodopa-induced dyskinesias in
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-lesioned common marmosets
(Callithrix jacchus). Three monkeys developed a severe parkinsonian syndrome
following administration of MPTP. In response to daily levodopa treatment the
animals developed reproducible and idiosyncratic peak-dose dyskinesias.
Pretreatment with (-)-OSU 6162 and raclopride, in doses increased by multiples of
three, both dose-dependently relieved the levodopa-induced dyskinesias. However, 
in contrast to when raclopride pretreatment was given, (-)-OSU 6162 pretreatment 
did not induce akinesia. Our investigation suggests that (-)-OSU 6162 may be
useful an an adjuvant treatment to levodopa in advanced Parkinson's disease to
selectively combat levodopa-induced dyskinesias without affecting the
antiparkinsonian response.

We described the preparation of acute living slices from the hippocampus of the
neonatal common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). Slices from a temporal lobe
section were prepared quickly using a rotary slicer. By this method, we
successfully recorded field potentials, namely, pre-synaptic fiber volley and
field excitatory post-synaptic potentials, from the hippocampal CA1 region with
conventional electrophysiological techniques, and analyzed the indicators of
synaptic function such as input-output curve. This study thus presents an
efficient preparation method for acute living hippocampal slice from which
synaptic function of the hippocampus in non-human primate can be analyzed.

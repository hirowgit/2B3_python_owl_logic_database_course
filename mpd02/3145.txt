Here we present evidence that the pyramidal cell phenotype varies markedly in the
cortex of different anthropoid species. Regional and species differences in the
size of, number of bifurcations in, and spine density of the basal dendritic
arbors cannot be explained by brain size. Instead, pyramidal cell morphology
appears to accord with the specialized cortical function these cells perform.
Cells in the prefrontal cortex of humans are more branched and more spinous than 
those in the temporal and occipital lobes. Moreover, cells in the prefrontal
cortex of humans are more branched and more spinous than those in the prefrontal 
cortex of macaque and marmoset monkeys. These results suggest that highly
spinous, compartmentalized, pyramidal cells (and the circuits they form) are
required to perform complex cortical functions such as comprehension, perception,
and planning.

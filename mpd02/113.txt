The mediodorsal thalamus (MD) is a higher-order nucleus located within the
central thalamus in many mammalian species. Emerging evidence from MD lesions and
tracer injections suggests that the MD is reciprocally connected to the
prefrontal cortex (PFC) and plays an essential role in specific cognitive
processes and tasks. MD subdivisions (medial, central, and lateral) are poorly
segregated at the molecular level in rodents, leading to a lack of MD
subdivision-specific Cre driver mice. Moreover, this lack of molecular
identifiers hinders MD subdivision- and cell-type-specific circuit formation and 
function analysis. Therefore, using publicly available databases, we explored
molecules separately expressed in MD subdivisions. In addition to MD subdivision 
markers, we identified several genes expressed in a subdivision-specific
combination and classified them. Furthermore, after developing medial MD (MDm) or
central MD (MDc) region-specific Cre mouse lines, we identified diverse region-
and layer-specific PFC projection patterns. Comparison between classified MD
marker genes in mice and common marmosets, a nonhuman primate model, revealed
diverging gene expression patterns. These results highlight the species-specific 
organization of cell types and their projections in the MD thalamus.

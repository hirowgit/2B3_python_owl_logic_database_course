OBJECTIVE: Establishment of preclinical method evaluating behavioral protective
actions of drugs for Parkinson's disease was attempted using l-deprenyl (DEP) as 
a reference drug in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2, 3, 6-tetrahydropyridine
(MPTP)-treated common marmosets.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifteen marmosets received MPTP at 2 mg/kg, subcutaneously
(s.c.) per day for three consecutive days. To these marmosets, intragastric
(i.g.) administration of DEP at 10 mg/kg was pretreated 2 h before each MPTP
administration in DEP3 group and pretreated only in the first MPTP administration
day in DEP1 group. As a control, distilled water (DW) was pretreated before each 
MPTP administration (n = 5 for each of three groups).
RESULTS: In DW group, decreased daily activity counts and increased dysfunction
scores were persistently observed for 3 weeks after MPTP. In DEP groups, the
similar changes of both levels to those in DW group were temporally observed
after MPTP for several days and then the values recovered to the pre-MPTP levels.
The results of autoradiography performed after above behavioral observations
indicated that markedly lower bindings of [(11)C]PE2I (ligand for dopamine
transporters) were observed at the striatum of DW group marmoset as compared with
the striatum of additionally prepared MPTP-free marmoset (n = 5). The bindings in
DEP groups were almost the same as in the MPTP-free marmoset brains.
CONCLUSION: The present preclinical methods using continuous recording of
activity of marmosets in their living cages and autoradiography using dopamine
transporter ligand might be sensitive for detecting protective actions of drugs
for Parkinson's disease.

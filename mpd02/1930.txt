Recently, genome-wide association studies have identified a strong association
between the ZBTB38 locus and human height. In a functional study, we detected two
RT-PCR products of ZBTB38, amplified with primers in exons 7 and 8 from a
chondrocyte cell line, C-28/I2. Sequencing revealed that the longer product
contained an Alu segment in intron 7 of ZBTB38, which contained a potential
splicing acceptor site that likely was used to generate the alternative
transcript. Insertion of the Alu segment changed the consensus Kozak sequence of 
the ZBTB38 transcript, potentially altering translational efficiency. We
performed RT-PCR using 16 tissue samples from humans and 8 tissue samples from
primates to determine any tissue specificity or evolutionary conservation of the 
alternative splicing. Although we failed to identify any difference among the
tissues, all primate samples expressed only the shorter Alu segment (lacking the 
transcript), suggesting that the alternative splicing event is hominid
primate-specific.

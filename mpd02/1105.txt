The marmoset model of melioidosis was used to explore whether there was any
difference in the disease presentation and/or the lesion formation following
inhalational challenge with one of four strains of Burkholderia pseudomallei
(K96243, 1026b, HBPUB10303a and HBPUB10134a). Marmosets were challenged with a
range of bacterial doses and bacterial load, histological and physiological
features were determined temporally following lethal disease. Melioidosis
presented as an acute, febrile disease with bacteraemia, bacterial dissemination,
necrotizing hepatitis, splenitis and pneumonia which was independent of the
challenge strain. Generally, there were no major differences in the manifestation
of melioidosis following challenge by the different strains of B. pseudomallei;
however, there were some differences in the time to death and the severity of the
pathological features. The pathological features observed in the liver and spleen
of animals challenged with B. pseudomallei strain 1026b were statistically less
severe (P < 0.05) and less frequent. However, more severe foci of disease were
evident in the lungs of animals challenged with strain 1026b. In all cases, the
lesions developed from small areas of bacteria-infected macrophages surrounded by
non-infected neutrophils into large lesions with both immune cell types infected.
The marmoset model was a useful tool enabling the distinction of subtle
difference in the pathological response to B. pseudomallei.

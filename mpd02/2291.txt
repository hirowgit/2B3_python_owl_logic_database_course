Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disease in which pigmented midbrain
neurons progressively die producing a dopamine (DA) deficit in the striatum which
manifests as an akinetic movement disorder. Experimentally induced striatal DA
depletion in animals is a valid model of parkinsonism. The capacity of certain
substances to damage catecholaminergic neurones has been used for a long time to 
produce DA deficiency in animals. This unit focuses on methods for inducing
parkinsonism using the neurotoxins MPTP and 6-hydroxy dopamine and methods for
evaluating the animals. Other models are briefly reviewed.

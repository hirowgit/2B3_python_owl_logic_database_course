The objective of the present investigation was to conduct a comparative
macroscopic study of the arterial vascularization of the mandible and maxilla of 
neotropical primates of the genera Cebus, Alouatta, Callithrix, and
Leontopithecus. After vinyl was injected into the arterial system of the head of 
each specimen, the pieces were macerated and corroded. The level of the
bifurcation of the common carotid artery into the internal and external carotids 
varied between the first and third cervical vertebrae. The external carotid
artery accounts for most of the vascularization of the facial structures. The
actual vessels responsible for the supply of this region are the sublingual,
facial, angular, lingual, submandibular, submental, inferior and superior labial,
maxillary, inferior alveolar, infraorbital, superior posterior alveolar, palatine
major, and sphenopalatine arteries. We conclude that although the arterial
vascular pattern was similar in all the genera studied, and resembles the human
pattern, there are notable variations in the vasculature of the mandible and
maxilla among these four neotropical genera.

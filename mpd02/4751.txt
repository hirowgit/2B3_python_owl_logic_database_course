Localization of delta 5-3 beta- and 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity
in the efferent ducts, epididymis and vas deferens of the rabbit, hamster and
marmoset monkey.

Prakash A, Moore HD.

The presence and distribution of delta 5-3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase
(delta 5-3 beta-HSD: EC 1.1.1.51) and 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17
beta-HSD: EC 1.1.1.51) were studied histochemically in the excurrent ducts of the
rabbit, hamster and marmoset monkey. Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and
testosterone were used as substrates for delta 5-3 beta-HSD and 17 beta-HSD
respectively, while phenanthroline monohydrate was used to eliminate non-specific
staining due to other tissue dehydrogenases. The rabbit possessed least enzyme
activity, which was confined to tubules in the middle segment of the epididymis. 
Enzyme activity was demonstrable throughout the excurrent ducts of the hamster
and marmoset, with maximal staining occurring in the middle segment of the
epididymis in both species. The region of maximum activity of hydroxysteroid
dehydrogenase is where spermatozoa first develop their fertilizing capacity.

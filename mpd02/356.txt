BACKGROUND: Human chromosome 19 has many unique characteristics including gene
density more than double the genome-wide average and 20 large tandemly clustered 
gene families. It also has the highest GC content of any chromosome, especially
outside gene clusters. The high GC content and concomitant high content of
hypermutable CpG sites raises the possibility chromosome 19 exhibits higher
levels of nucleotide diversity both within and between species, and may possess
greater variation in DNA methylation that regulates gene expression.
RESULTS: We examined GC and CpG content of chromosome 19 orthologs across
representatives of the primate order. In all 12 primate species with suitable
genome assemblies, chromosome 19 orthologs have the highest GC content of any
chromosome. CpG dinucleotides and CpG islands are also more prevalent in
chromosome 19 orthologs than other chromosomes. GC and CpG content are generally 
higher outside the gene clusters. Intra-species variation based on SNPs in human 
common dbSNP, rhesus, crab eating macaque, baboon and marmoset datasets is most
prevalent on chromosome 19 and its orthologs. Inter-species comparisons based on 
phyloP conservation show accelerated nucleotide evolution for chromosome 19
promoter flanking and enhancer regions. These same regulatory regions show the
highest CpG density of any chromosome suggesting they possess considerable
methylome regulatory potential.
CONCLUSIONS: The pattern of high GC and CpG content in chromosome 19 orthologs,
particularly outside gene clusters, is present from human to mouse lemur
representing 74 million years of primate evolution. Much CpG variation exists
both within and between primate species with a portion of this variation
occurring in regulatory regions.

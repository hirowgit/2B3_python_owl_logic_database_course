Injections of D-amphetamine (5 mg/kg) three hours before sacrifice were found to 
elicit robust Fos-like immunoreactivity in the striatum of cynomolgus monkeys and
of the common marmoset. Labeled cells were most frequently observed in the medial
portion of the caudate nucleus and were distributed in a patchy fashion.
Comparison with adjacent sections stained for the calcium binding protein
calbindin indicated that the patches of amphetamine induced labeling corresponded
to the calbindin-poor striosomes. These results are consistent with those
reported in rats and thus suggest similarities in the basic organization of
striatal mechanisms underlying the response to amphetamine in rodents and
primates.

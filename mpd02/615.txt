BACKGROUND: Congenital fused labia (CFL) is defined as a failure or significant
delay in the opening of the juvenile sealed labia majora. This phenotype is known
to be variably common in adult captive female marmosets but has never been
investigated in detail before.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Here, we define, describe and quantify the variations in
the degree of closure of the vulva in 122 captive marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) 
from 1.2 to 42 months old and include colony analysis.
RESULTS: There was a negative correlation between the degree of labial fusion and
animal age after prepubertal period (P < 0.05). CFL females had higher number CFL
relatives (4.3 ± 0.6 vs 2.4 ± 0.5 for non-CFL, P < 0.05) and more external
ancestors compared to non-CFL (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results therefore suggest that CFL phenotype is most likely
associated with epigenetic effects induced by the captive environment and colony 
management strategy of extensive crossing of family lines to promote
heterozygosity.

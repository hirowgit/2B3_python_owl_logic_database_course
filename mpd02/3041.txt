Epstein-Barr Virus-transformed B lymphoblastoid cell lines (EBV-LCLs) are
routinely used for the in vitro expansion of T cells. However, these cell lines
are reported to produce the cytokine IL-10, which is inhibitory for T cells. We, 
therefore, characterized a panel of 37 EBV-LCLs for a variety of cell surface
markers, for secretion of various cytokines including IL-10 and for
immunoglobulin production. These cell lines were derived from normal donors or
patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer, acute myelogenous leukemia, melanoma or 
colon cancer. Overall, 26 lines were positive for CD19 and CD20, and 11 were
negative for both. All of the lines were strongly HLA-DR+, while CD40 expression 
was variable. Twenty-four (65%) were both CD23+ and secreted immunoglobulin, and 
33 expressed kappa and/or lambda light chains. Additionally, all of the EBV-LCLs 
were negative for T cell (CD3), NK cell (CD16, CD56), monocyte (CD14) and
granulocyte (CD66b) surface markers. Some level of IL-10, IL-6, IL-12p40 and
TNF-alpha cytokine production was detected in 33, 18, 19 and 12 EBV-LCLs,
respectively. Together, these data reflect the heterogeneity of EBV-LCLs, which
cautions their use nondiscriminately in various immunologic assays.

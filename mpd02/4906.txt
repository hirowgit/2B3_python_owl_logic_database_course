Husbandry and observation methods of a breeding colony of marmosets (Callithrix
jacchus) for behavioural research.

Ingram JC.

By allowing families to increase in size, co-operation between parents and
adolescents in infant care was encouraged. Young adult pairs were subsequently
created with these marmosets which had experience of handling infants to provide 
a stable basis for breeding 2nd and 3rd generation marmosets in captivity.

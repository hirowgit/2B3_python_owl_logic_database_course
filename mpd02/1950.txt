Color vision in mammals is based on the expression of at least two cone opsins
that are sensitive to different wavelengths of light. Furthermore, retinal
pathways conveying color-opponent signals are required for color discrimination. 
Most of the primates are trichromats, and "color-coded channels" of their retinas
are unveiled to a large extent. In contrast, knowledge of cone-selective pathways
in nonprimate dichromats is only slowly emerging, although retinas of dichromats 
like mice or rats are extensively studied as model systems for retinal
information processing. Here, we review recent progress of research on
color-coded pathways in nonprimate dichromats to identify differences or
similarities between di- and trichromatic mammals. In addition, we applied
immunohistochemical methods and confocal microscopy to retinas of different
species and present data on their neuronal properties, which are expected to
contribute to color vision. Basic neuronal features such as the "blue cone
bipolar cell" exist in every species investigated so far. Moreover, there is
increasing evidence for chromatic OFF channels in dichromats and retinal ganglion
cells that relay color-opponent signals to the brain. In conclusion, di- and
trichromats share similar retinal pathways for color transmission and processing.

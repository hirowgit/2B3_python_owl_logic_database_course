Nanoparticles, including lipopolyamines leading to lipoplexes, liposomes, and
polyplexes are targeted drug carrier systems in the current search for a
successful delivery system for polynucleic acids. This review is focused on the
impact of gene and siRNA delivery for studies of efficacy, pharmacodynamics, and 
pharmacokinetics within the setting of the wide variety of in vivo animal models 
now used. This critical appraisal of the recent literature sets out the different
models that are currently being investigated to bridge from studies in cell lines
through towards clinical reality. Whilst many scientists will be familiar with
rodent (murine, fecine, cricetine, and musteline) models, few probably think of
fish as a clinically relevant animal model, but zebrafish, madake, and rainbow
trout are all being used. Larger animal models include rabbit, cat, dog, and cow.
Pig is used both for the prevention of foot-and-mouth disease and human diseases,
sheep is a model for corneal transplantation, and the horse naturally develops
arthritis. Non-human primate models (macaque, common marmoset, owl monkey) are
used for preclinical gene vector safety and efficacy trials to bridge the gap
prior to clinical studies. We aim for the safe development of clinically
effective delivery systems for DNA and RNAi technologies.

There is an emerging interest in brain-mapping projects in countries across the
world, including the USA, Europe, Australia and China. In 2014, Japan started a
brain-mapping project called Brain Mapping by Integrated Neurotechnologies for
Disease Studies (Brain/MINDS). Brain/MINDS aims to map the structure and function
of neuronal circuits to ultimately understand the vast complexity of the human
brain, and takes advantage of a unique non-human primate animal model, the common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). In Brain/MINDS, the RIKEN Brain Science Institute 
acts as a central institute. The objectives of Brain/MINDS can be categorized
into the following three major subject areas: (i) structure and functional
mapping of a non-human primate brain (the marmoset brain); (ii) development of
innovative neurotechnologies for brain mapping; and (iii) human brain mapping;
and clinical research. Brain/MINDS researchers are highly motivated to identify
the neuronal circuits responsible for the phenotype of neurological and
psychiatric disorders, and to understand the development of these devastating
disorders through the integration of these three subject areas.

We report the derivation of eight pluripotent cell lines from common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus) blastocysts. These cell lines are positive for a series of
markers (alkaline phosphatase, SSEA-3, SSEA-4, TRA-1-60, and TRA-1-81) that
characterize undifferentiated human embryonal carcinoma cells and rhesus
embryonic stem cells. All eight cell lines had a modal chromosome number of 46;
seven cell lines were XX and one was XY. Two cell lines (Cj11 and Cj62) were
cultured continuously for over a year and remained undifferentiated and euploid. 
In the absence of fibroblast feeder layers, these cell lines differentiated to
multiple cell types, even in the presence of leukemia inhibiting factor.
Differentiated cells secreted bioactive CG into the culture medium and expressed 
alpha-CG, beta-CG, and alpha-fetoprotein mRNA, indicating trophoblast and
endoderm differentiation. Bioactive CG secretion in differentiating cells was
increased substantially in the presence of GnRH agonist D-Trp6-Pro9-NHEt. When
grown at high densities, these cells formed embryoid bodies with a close
resemblance to early postimplantation embryos, including the formation of a yolk 
sac, amnion, and an embryonic disc with an early primitive streak. These results 
make these pluripotent cells strong candidates for marmoset embryonic stem cells.

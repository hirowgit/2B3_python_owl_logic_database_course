Two methods of measuring body temperature were compared in common marmosets.
Subcutaneous temperatures were measured remotely via previously implanted
subcutaneous microchips (Plexx BV, IPTT-100) prior to measurement of rectal
temperature using a conventional rectal probe. Marmosets were treated with saline
or the brain penetrant, 5-HT1A/B/D receptor agonist SKF-99101H
(3-(2-dimethylaminoethyl)-4-chloro-5-propoxyindole hemifumarate) (0.3-3 mg/kg
SC), which has previously been shown to induce hypothermia in guinea pigs. Body
temperature was sampled immediately before drug administration and at 30-min
intervals thereafter for a period of 2.5 h. SKF-99101H dose-dependently induced
hypothermia in the common marmoset and there was close agreement between rectal
and subcutaneous body temperatures, with an average difference in absolute body
temperature of 0.26+/-0.02 degrees C. The data show that subcutaneously implanted
microchips provide a simple, reliable measure of body temperature in common
marmosets which is sensitive to pharmacological intervention, minimizes handling 
induced stress, and is minimally invasive.

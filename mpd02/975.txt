Racemic omeprazole has been used for clinically treating gastric acid-related
diseases and also as a typical human cytochrome P450 (P450) 2C19 probe substrate 
in preclinical studies. S-Omeprazole has been developed as a single enantiomer
medicine, which has been reported not to be associated with polymorphic human
P450 2C19 phenotypes. In this study, 5-hydroxylation and sulfoxidation
activities, with respect to stereoselective R- and S-omeprazole oxidations by
liver microsomes from experimental animals including non-human primates and
humans, were investigated in vitro. Liver microsomes from humans, cynomolgus
monkeys, and mice preferentially mediated R-omeprazole 5-hydroxylations, however 
those from marmosets, minipigs, dogs, and rats preferentially mediated
S-omeprazole 5-hydroxylations. High catalytic activities were observed for
recombinant human P450 2C19 in R-omeprazole 5-hydroxlations, cynomolgus monkey
P450 2C19 in both R- and S-omeprazole 5-hydroxlations, and marmoset P450 2C19 in 
S-omeprazole 5-hydroxlations. On the other hand, human, cynomolgus monkey, and
marmoset P450 3A enzymes preferentially mediated S-omeprazole sulfoxidations.
Correlation and kinetic analyses revealed a high affinity of polymorphic
cynomolgus monkey and marmoset liver microsomal P450 2C19 enzymes with respect to
R- and S-omeprazole 5-hydroxylations, respectively, and a high capacity of
cynomolgus monkey and marmoset liver microsomal P450 3A4 for omeprazole
5-hydroxylations and sulfoxidations. R-and S-omeprazole 5-hydroxylation
activities in cynomolgus monkey and marmoset liver microsomes were significantly 
different among wild-type, heterozygous, and homozygous animals genotyped for
cynomolgus monkey P450 2C19 p.[(Phe100Asn; Ala103Val; Ile112Leu)] and for
marmoset P450 2C19 p.[(Phe7Leu; Ser254Leu; Ile469Thr)], respectively. The results
of this study demonstrate polymorphic cynomolgus monkey and marmoset P450
2C19-dependent omeprazole oxidation activities with individual variations similar
to humans.

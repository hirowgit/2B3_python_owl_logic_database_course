BACKGROUND: The maintenance of marmosets in captivity may trigger various
disorders. The objective of this study was to provide a radiographic evaluation
of the forelimbs and hind limbs of marmosets rescued from illegal wildlife trade 
and maintained in captivity.
METHODS: Fourteen marmosets were studied.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Three marmosets were apparently normal. Of the eleven
marmosets with radiographic changes in the hind limbs, five had pelvic narrowing 
and bilateral varus deviation of the femur, with one suggestive of rickets and
another of osteomalacia. The other marmosets showed changes such as malunion of
acetabular fracture, transtibial amputation, tibial antecurvatum, and knee
osteoarthritis. Six marmosets showed alterations in the forelimbs such as radius 
fracture, scapulohumeral subluxation, and elbow joint incongruence. In
conclusion, 78.57% of the marmosets had bone and/or joint changes detected by
plain radiography, which were found predominantly in the hind limbs and without
impediment to locomotion in captivity.

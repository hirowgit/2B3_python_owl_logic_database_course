Amazonia has the richest primate fauna in the world. Nonetheless, the diversity
and distribution of Amazonian primates remain little known and the scarcity of
baseline data challenges their conservation. These challenges are especially
acute in the Amazonian arc of deforestation, the 2500 km long southern edge of
the Amazonian biome that is rapidly being deforested and converted to
agricultural and pastoral landscapes. Amazonian marmosets of the genus Mico are
little known endemics of this region and therefore a priority for research and
conservation efforts. However, even nascent conservation efforts are hampered by 
taxonomic uncertainties in this group, such as the existence of a potentially new
species from the Juruena-Teles Pires interfluve hidden within the M. emiliae
epithet. Here we test if these marmosets belong to a distinct species using new
morphological, phylogenomic, and geographic distribution data analysed within an 
integrative taxonomic framework. We discovered a new, pseudo-cryptic Mico species
hidden within the epithet M. emiliae, here described and named after Horacio
Schneider, the pioneer of molecular phylogenetics of Neotropical primates. We
also clarify the distribution, evolutionary and morphological relationships of
four other Mico species, bridging Linnean, Wallacean, and Darwinian shortfalls in
the conservation of primates in the Amazonian arc of deforestation.

BACKGROUND: The rhesus enteric caliciviruses (ReCVs) were recently described.
METHODS: Prevalence of ReCV antibodies was tested in six species of captive
non-human primates.
RESULTS: High ReCV seroprevalence was revealed in rhesus and cynomolgus macaques.
CONCLUSIONS: High rates of ReCV seroprevalence and diarrhea in juvenile macaques 
suggest that ReCVs may play a role in morbidity.

Parvocellular (P-) and magnocellular (M-) cells in the marmoset LGN can receive
prominent rod input up to relatively high illuminance levels (Kremers et al.,
1997b). In the present paper, we quantify rod and cone input strengths under
different retinal illuminance levels. The stimulus was based on the so-called
"silent substitution" method. The activities of P- and M-cells of dichromatic
animals were recorded extracellularly. We were able to adequately describe the
response amplitudes and phases by a vector summation of rod and cone signals. At 
low retinal illuminance levels, the cells' responses were determined by rod and
cone inputs. With increasing illuminances the strength of the cone input
increased relative to the rod strength. But, we often found significant rod
inputs up to illuminances equivalent to 700 td in the human eye or more. Rod
input strength was more pronounced in cells with receptive fields at large
retinal eccentricities. The phase differences between rod and cone inputs suggest
that the rod signals lag about 45 ms behind the cone signals.

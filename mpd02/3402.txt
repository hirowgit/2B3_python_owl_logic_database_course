Previous studies have suggested that administration of a clinically sign-free
dose of sarin to non-human primates gives rise to subtle changes in brain
electrical activity as measured by electroencephalography (EEG) several months
following exposure. The functional significances of such changes are unclear. The
present study monitored EEG by using implantable radiotelemetry, and also
assessed the performance of complex behavioural tasks, in non-human primates for 
up to 15 months following exposure to a low dose of sarin. Baselines of EEG and
behaviour were shown to be stable over several months in control animals. The
doses of sarin administered caused erythrocyte cholinesterase inhibitions of
36.4% to 67.1%. Overall, no significant changes in EEG patterns were observed
although there were increases in beta 2 amplitude which approached significance
(p=0.07). No deleterious effects on performance were seen on the touchscreen
mediated discrimination tasks presented from the Cambridge Neuropsychological
Test Automated Battery (CANTAB). This study illustrates the validity of the
approach employed and makes an important contribution to the investigation of the
long-term effects of organophosphorous compounds.

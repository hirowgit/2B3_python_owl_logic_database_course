Patent and pathologic infections of the human hookworm Necator americanus were
established in the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). In a pilot study, a
laboratory strain of N. americanus was compared with a fresh field isolate.
Pathology was more severe in animals infected with a fresh isolate. In all
animals, infection was associated with increased total plasma IgE and production 
of IgG specific to adult worm excretory/secretory (ES) products. Histamine was
released by basophils in response to IgE, ES products, and a recombinant hookworm
allergen, calreticulin. The pilot study indicated the potential of this animal
model of hookworm infection and led us to investigate the consequences of
infecting a further cohort with the fresh field isolate. This second study
confirmed our initial findings, that it is possible to investigate the human
hookworm N. americanus in a model exhibiting many of the characteristics of the
immunology of hookworm infection in its definitive host.

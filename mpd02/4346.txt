A subacute toxicity study of Indomethacin administered by oral route, was carried
out in the marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). Groups of three males and three females
received Indomethacin directly into the stomach by means of a catheter for a
period of 4 weeks at the dose levels of 0, 2, 6, and 12 mg/kg body wt/day and
then were euthanized for pathological evaluation. All marmosets given 12
mg/kg/day and one marmoset given 6 mg/kg/day died during the dosing period
(within 20 days). At 12 mg/kg/day, Indomethacin induced severe gastrointestinal
toxicity (hemorrhage, ulcers, and necrosis with peritonitis), while at the
dosages of 6 and 2 mg/kg/day some moderate to slight dose-related functional and 
morphological renal alterations (increase of serum urea, reduction of serum
albumin, increase of serum potassium and/or chloride, and subacute inflammation) 
were observed. The fact that in many respects these alterations are similar to
those observed in man is a further demonstration of the validity of the marmoset 
as an experimental model.

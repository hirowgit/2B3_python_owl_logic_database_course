To obtain definitive evidence that milk-borne infection plays a critical role in 
the endemy or mother-to-child transmission of human T-cell leukemia virus type-I 
(HTLV-I), we inoculated concentrated fresh human milk cells obtained from HTLV-I 
carrier mothers into the oral cavity of a common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).
Twenty-eight milk samples were collected (5-10 ml each) from 17 carrier mothers
in the first week after delivery. Cells in the milk were centrifuged down and
resuspended in 1/10 vol of the milk fluid. The concentrated cell suspensions were
successively inoculated into the oral cavity of a common marmoset. The marmoset
was found to be seroconverted by indirect immunofluorescence assay at 2.5 months 
after the first inoculation of the milk (3.5 X 10(8) cells in total), and was
later confirmed to be infected with HTLV-I by the detection of viral antigen
expression in short-term cultures of its peripheral blood T-lymphocytes. The
results strongly support the working hypothesis that milk-borne infection plays a
significant role in the mother-to-child transmission of HTLV-I.

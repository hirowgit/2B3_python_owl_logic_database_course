In a modified MPTP model of Parkinson's disease in the marmoset, both L-DOPA and 
the dopamine D2 agonist quinpirole were found to exhibit anti-bradykinetic
activity. Both the dopamine D1 agonist SKF38393 and the D1 antagonist SCH23390
reduced the anti-bradykinetic action of L-DOPA and quinpirole. These results are 
discussed with respect to partial agonist activity of SKF38393 and the
possibility that other dopamine receptors may be required for anti-Parkinsonian
drug activity.

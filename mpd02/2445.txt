as the result of gene conversion.

The semen coagulum proteins have undergone substantial structural changes during 
evolution. In primates, these seminal vesicle-secreted proteins are known as
semenogelin I (SEMG1) and semenogelin II (SEMG2). Previous studies on the common 
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) showed that ejaculated semen from this New World
monkey contains semenogelin, but it remained unclear whether it carries both
genes or only SEMG1 and no SEMG2, like the closely related cotton-top tamarin
(Saguinus oedipus). In this study we show that there are two genes, both
expressed in the seminal vesicles. Surprisingly, the genes show an almost perfect
sequence identity in a region of 1.25 kb, encompassing nearly half of the genes
and containing exon 1, intron 1, and the first 0.9 kb of exon 2. The underlying
molecular mechanism is most likely gene conversion, and a phylogenetic analysis
suggests that SEMG1 is the most probable donor gene. The marmoset SEMG1 in this
report differs from a previously reported cDNA by a lack of nucleotides encoding 
one repeat of 60 amino acids, suggesting that marmoset SEMG1 displays allelic
size variation. This is similar to what was recently demonstrated in humans, but 
in marmosets the polymorphism was generated by a repeat duplication, whereas in
humans it was a deletion. Together, these studies shed new light on the evolution
of semenogelins and the mechanisms that have generated the structural diversity
of semen coagulum proteins.

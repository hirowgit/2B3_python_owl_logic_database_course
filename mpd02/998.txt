Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) causes sporadic zoonotic 
disease and healthcare-associated outbreaks in human. MERS is often complicated
by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi-organ failure(1,2). The
high incidence of renal failure in MERS is a unique clinical feature not often
found in other human coronavirus infections(3,4). Whether MERS-CoV infects the
kidney and how it triggers renal failure are not understood(5,6). Here, we
demonstrated renal infection and apoptotic induction by MERS-CoV in human ex vivo
organ culture and a nonhuman primate model. High-throughput analysis revealed
that the cellular genes most significantly perturbed by MERS-CoV have previously 
been implicated in renal diseases. Furthermore, MERS-CoV induced apoptosis
through upregulation of Smad7 and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) expression in
both kidney and lung cells. Conversely, knockdown of Smad7 effectively inhibited 
MERS-CoV replication and protected cells from virus-induced cytopathic effects.
We further demonstrated that hyperexpression of Smad7 or FGF2 induced a strong
apoptotic response in kidney cells. Common marmosets infected by MERS-CoV
developed ARDS and disseminated infection in kidneys and other organs. Smad7 and 
FGF2 expression were elevated in the lungs and kidneys of the infected animals.
Our results provide insights into the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV and host targets
for treatment.

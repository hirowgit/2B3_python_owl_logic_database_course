In contrast to the visual system, the auditory system has longer subcortical
pathways and more spiking synapses between the peripheral receptors and the
cortex. This unique organization reflects the needs of the auditory system to
extract behaviorally relevant information from a complex acoustic environment
using strategies different from those used by other sensory systems. The neural
representations of acoustic information in auditory cortex can be characterized
by three types: (1) isomorphic (faithful) representations of acoustic structures;
(2) non-isomorphic transformations of acoustic features and (3) transformations
from acoustical to perceptual dimensions. The challenge facing auditory
neurophysiologists is to understand the nature of the latter two transformations.
In this article, I will review recent studies from our laboratory regarding
temporal discharge patterns in auditory cortex of awake marmosets and cortical
representations of time-varying signals. Findings from these studies show that
(1) firing patterns of neurons in auditory cortex are dependent on stimulus
optimality and context and (2) the auditory cortex forms internal representations
of sounds that are no longer faithful replicas of their acoustic structures.

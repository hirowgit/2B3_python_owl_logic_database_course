Recreational use of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA;"ecstasy") poses
worldwide potential health problems. Clinical studies show that repeated exposure
to low oral doses of MDMA has toxic effects on the brain, altering cognitive and 
psychosocial behavior. Functional magnetic resonance imaging in conscious
marmoset monkeys was used to evaluate the sensitivity of the brain to an oral
dose of MDMA (1 mg/kg). Following MDMA administration, the midbrain raphe nuclei 
and substantia nigra, major sources of serotonin and dopamine, were activated as 
were the hippocampus, hypothalamus and amygdala. The corticostriatal circuit of
dorsal thalamus, sensorimotor cortex and basal ganglia showed a robust, coherent 
activation pattern. Two key reward areas, the nucleus accumbens and prefrontal
cortex, and most other cortical regions showed little activation. The visual
cortex, however, showed intense activation without applied visual stimuli. These 
data identify brain areas and functional circuits sensitive to a recreational
dose of MDMA, some of which may be vulnerable to long-term intermittent exposure 
to this drug.

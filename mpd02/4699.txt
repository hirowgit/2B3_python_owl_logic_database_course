The second, intralaminar thalamo-cortical projection system.

Brysch I, Brysch W, Creutzfeldt O, Hayes NL, Schlingensiepen KH.

In the marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), HRP and 3H-apo-HRP were injected into
various cortical regions and the positions of labelled neurons in the
non-specific, intralaminar thalamic nuclei (N. centralis and centre m edian )
were investigated. Although neuron populations projecting to the different
cortical regions overlap widely, a coarse topology exists inasmuch as
intralaminar neurons projecting to the posterior cortex were located more
rostrally and those projecting to the anterior cortex were located more caudally 
in the intralaminar complex. With injections into nearby cortical regions of the 
parieto-temporal association cortex with HRP and 3H-apo-HRP, respectively, no
double labelled cells were found in the intralaminar nuclei, although the fields 
of labelled cells completely overlapped. Also in the specific projection nuclei
no double labelled cells were encountered. About 10-20% of the thalamo-cortical
projection cells are located in the intralaminar nuclei. Some functional aspects 
of this second thalamo-cortical projection system are discussed.

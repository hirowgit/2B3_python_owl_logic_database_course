Digestive tract morphology and function were studied in the common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus), a small (350 g) exudivore with a well-developed caecum.
Transit times (times of first appearance of the markers in the faeces following a
pulse dose in the food) were similar for Co-EDTA, which marks the fluid phase of 
the digesta, and Cr-mordanted cell walls, which marked the large (600-1200
microns) particulate phase of the digesta. However, mean retention time (the
average time taken for the markers to transverse the whole digestive tract) for
Co-EDTA was significantly longer than for Cr-cell walls, indicating selective
retention of fluid digesta relative to large particles, probably in the caecum.
These data are consistent with a digestive strategy of the common marmoset that
appears to be based on rapid digestion of higher quality foods (animal prey,
fruits) in the small intestine, followed by microbial fermentation of the complex
polysaccharides of plant exudates in the caecum, which would allow for
considerable dietary flexibility in its natural habitat of scrub forests.

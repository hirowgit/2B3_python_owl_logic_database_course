Sexual behavior and mating patterns are described for 3 free-ranging groups of
common marmosets living in a coastal forest in northeastern Brazil. Each group
contained 2 breeding females. Within groups, sexual behavior was generally
restricted to breeding females and a single behaviorally dominant male. Of 101
mounts and copulations, 24 involved pairings of individuals from 2 different
groups. Extragroup sexual behavior was performed by both breeding and nonbreeding
group members, and 65% of all adults mounted or copulated with an extragroup
individual at least once. Sexual behavior occurred throughout the female
reproductive cycle but was significantly more frequent during an 11-day
'conception period'. Thus, while female marmosets show no physical signs of
estrus, both males and females likely do have some information about the timing
of ovulation. Mating patterns in this population included both polygyny and
monogamy and varied between groups and over time.

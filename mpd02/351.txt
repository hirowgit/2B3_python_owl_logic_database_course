Understanding the principles of neuronal connectivity requires tools for
efficient quantification and visualization of large datasets. The primate cortex 
is particularly challenging due to its complex mosaic of areas, which in many
cases lack clear boundaries. Here, we introduce a resource that allows
exploration of results of 143 retrograde tracer injections in the marmoset
neocortex. Data obtained in different animals are registered to a common
stereotaxic space using an algorithm guided by expert delineation of histological
borders, allowing accurate assignment of connections to areas despite
interindividual variability. The resource incorporates tools for analyses
relative to cytoarchitectural areas, including statistical properties such as the
fraction of labeled neurons and the percentage of supragranular neurons. It also 
provides purely spatial (parcellation-free) data, based on the stereotaxic
coordinates of 2 million labeled neurons. This resource helps bridge the gap
between high-density cellular connectivity studies in rodents and imaging-based
analyses of human brains.

The cockroaches Blatella germanica and Supella longipalpa can act as intermediate
hosts of Trichospirura leptostoma as demonstrated by experimental infestation.
The parasite developed from the embryonated egg into the infective larval stage
(L3) in cockroaches within 5-6 weeks. After experimental infection of marmosets
(Callithrix jacchus), eggs were first found in faecal samples (prepatency) at 8-9
weeks post-infection. Patency lasts about 2 years. Despite the presence of living
adult worms in the marmosets' pancreas, no additional eggs were observed in their
faeces after the patent period.

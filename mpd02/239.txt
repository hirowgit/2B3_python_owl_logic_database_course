Animal models are indispensable tools in the development of innovative treatments
for rare and incurable diseases. To date, there is almost no effective treatment 
for neurodegenerative diseases, and animal models that properly simulate human
disease pathologies are eagerly anticipated to identify disease biomarkers and
develop therapeutic methods and agents. Among experimental animals, non-human
primates are the most suitable animal models for the study of neurodegenerative
diseases with human-specific higher brain dysfunction and late-onset and slowly
progressing symptoms. With the rapid development of novel therapies such as
oligonucleotide therapeutics and genome editing technologies, non-human primate
models for neurodegenerative diseases will be essential for preclinical studies
and active interventional trials. In a previous publication, we reported the
generation of the first transgenic marmoset model of spinocerebellar ataxia type 
3 and successful obtainment of subsequent generations with stable disease onset. 
Moreover, we generated transgenic marmosets in which the transgene was controlled
by the tetracycline-inducible gene expression system. In this mini-review, we
summarize the research on our marmoset model of spinocerebellar ataxia type 3.

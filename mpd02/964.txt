The black lion tamarin, Leontopithecus chrysopygus, is endemic to the Atlantic
Forest of the interior of the state of São Paulo in Brazil. Since the discovery
of the species, authors have described variations in the pelage of L.
chrysopygus, but the nature of this variation has remained unknown. We examined
museum specimens and living animals to see if the pelage of L. chrysopygus varies
individually, geographically or ontogenetically. We reviewed all known locality
records of the species, and concluded that the pelage of L. chrysopygus varies
individually and ontogenetically, but not geographically. The extent of the
golden chromogenetic fields is larger in younger individuals, and the pelage
becomes darker after successive moults. We examined 2 juveniles that presented a 
pelage similar to adult L. caissara. Geographically, there is a clear break in
the phenotypes attributed to L. caissara and L. chrysopygus, precluding clinal
variation and corroborating the specific status of the former. The separation
between these 2 species is coincident with a tectonic fault known as the
'Guapiara lineament', and may have been caused by a recent activation of this
geological formation. We also suggest a historical contact zone between L.
chrysopygus and the marmoset Callithrix aurita in the upper Rio Tietê region.

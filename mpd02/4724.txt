An outbreak of acute respiratory disease was observed in a colony of marmosets
(Callithrix jacchus). Parainfluenza Type I (Sendai) virus was isolated from the
lungs and from throat swabs of 2 animals which showed clinical signs of disease. 
A rising titre of serum neutralizing antibody to the virus isolated was detected 
in several affected animals. Approximately 50% of the colony showed clinical
signs of disease, and 3 animals died. The duration of illness ranged from 3 to 16
days.

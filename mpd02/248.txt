Nonhuman primates (NHPs) are an essential research model for gaining a
comprehensive understanding of the neural mechanisms of neurocognitive aging in
our own species. In the present study, we used resting state functional
connectivity (rsFC) to investigate the relationship between prefrontal cortical
and striatal neural interactions, and cognitive flexibility, in unanaesthetized
common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) at two time points during late middle age
(8 months apart, similar to a span of 5-6 years in humans). Based on our previous
findings, we also determine the reproducibility of connectivity measures over the
course of 8 months, particularly previously observed sex differences in rsFC.
Male marmosets exhibited remarkably similar patterns of stronger functional
connectivity relative to females and greater cognitive flexibility between the
two imaging time points. Network analysis revealed that the consistent sex
differences in connectivity and related cognitive associations were characterized
by greater node strength and/or degree values in several prefrontal, premotor and
temporal regions, as well as stronger intra PFC connectivity, in males compared
to females. The current study supports the existence of robust sex differences in
prefrontal and striatal resting state networks that may contribute to differences
in cognitive function and offers insight on the neural systems that may be
compromised in cognitive aging and age-related conditions such as mild cognitive 
impairment and Alzheimer's disease.

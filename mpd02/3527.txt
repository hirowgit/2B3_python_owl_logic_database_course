Bacteriocin production has been studied in very few anaerobic bacteria, and no
report is available for Fusobacterium species. In the present study a total of
167 Fusobacterium isolates were tested for bacteriocin production: 70 isolates
were obtained from the oral cavity of patients with periodontal disease, 47 were 
recovered from healthy oral sites of human subjects and 50 from the oral cavity
of Callithrix penicillata. Autoantagonism and isoantagonism were observed when
the bacteriocin-producing isolates were tested against themselves.
Heteroantagonism was detected by testing the Fusobacterium isolates against 14
reference strains and 2 strains of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans from our 
laboratory collection. The auto-, iso- and heteroantagonism phenomena observed in
this comparative study suggest a possible ecological role for this (these)
antagonistic substance(s) in the oral environment.

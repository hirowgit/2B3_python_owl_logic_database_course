Myelin/oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) is a minor integral membrane protein
specific to CNS myelin, encoded by a gene located in the major histocompatibility
complex. MOG is an highly encephalitogenic autoantigen and a target for
autoaggressive immune responses in CNS inflammatory demyelinating diseases. We
performed transcriptomic analyses for a gene expressed only in mammalian CNS,
myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG). Complex splicing patterns were
exclusively found in primates and not in mice, unlike patterns found for other
myelin protein genes. In addition to those shared with rodents, these multiple
MOG isoforms likely support functions unique to the primate order, in particular 
maintenance of myelin structure, intracellular signaling, and modulation of CNS
autoimmunity via exposure of specific MOG determinants. Developmentally, in human
brain the splice variants of MOG appear at a late stage compared to the major
isoform, coincidental with myelination and myelin maturation, unlike other myelin
proteins. These findings are discussed within the framework of a biological basis
for phenotype diversity in recent mammalian evolution and for the notoriously
variable clinical expression of diseases such as multiple sclerosis.

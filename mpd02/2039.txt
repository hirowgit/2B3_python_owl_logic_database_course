Neurofeedback research in a model closely related to humans is recommended to
rule out placebo effects and unspecific factors bridging the gap between
nonvalidated empirical and standardized controlled research. In this article,
telemetric sensorimotor rhythm (SMR; 11-14 Hz) feedback training in the marmoset 
monkey is applied to examine the monkey's capability to voluntary control their
brain activity. Four monkeys, provided with two epidural bioelectric electrodes
above the sensorimotor cortex, were trained with positive reinforcement on SMR
measured by online analyses of 1.28 s electroencephalogram epochs in 30-min
sessions. These monkeys learned within five sessions to increase their alpha
activity. The first evidence of nonhuman primates having an operant control over 
the SMR is provided, an initial step for a much-needed scientific basis to
neurofeedback.

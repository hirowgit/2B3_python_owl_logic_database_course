Here we present the first report of heart rate, blood pressure, and locomotive
activity of a female common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) that was moving freely 
in its home cage during gestation, parturition, and lactation. We collected the
data by using a miniaturized telemetry and data-acquisition system (Data
Sciences, St. Paul, MN) that had been adapted for marmosets (1). The parameters
were recorded continually from 12 days before to 15 days after parturition.
Parturition lasted about 3.5 h, during which marked changes in heart rate,
systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure occurred. To obtain control
values, we again measured these parameters for 13 days during a "physiologically 
neutral" phase (4 months after parturition), when the female was neither pregnant
nor lactating. Heart rate was 200% higher, systolic blood pressure was 25%
higher, and diastolic blood pressure was 75% higher during parturition than
during the neutral phase.

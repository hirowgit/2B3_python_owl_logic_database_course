Angiogenesis is associated with follicular development and is regulated
independently within each follicle potentially making the functioning of its
vasculature critically important in determining its fate. This review examines
the various ways in which follicular angiogenesis may be monitored, describes the
follicular localisation and changes in pro- and anti-angiogenic factors that may 
regulate the process and how antagonists may be used to elucidate their
physiological role in vivo. Thus, inhibition of vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF), VEGF receptor-2, vascular endothelial cell cadherin or
interference with the angiopoietin system can inhibit follicular development or
prevent ovulation.

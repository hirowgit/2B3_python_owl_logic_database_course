Among primates, the common marmoset is suitable for primate embryology research. 
Its small body size, however, has delayed the technical development of efficient 
embryo transfer. Furthermore, three factors have been determined to adversely
affect the performance of marmoset embryo transfer: nonsurgical approaches, the
use of cryopreserved embryos, and the use of late-stage embryos. Here we
performed embryo transfer under conditions that included the above three factors 
and using either a small (1 μl or less) or a large volume (2-3 μl) of medium. The
pregnancy and birth rates were 50% (5/10) and 27% (3/11), respectively, when
using the large volume, and 80% (8/10) and 75% (9/12), respectively, when using
the small volume. The latter scores exceed those of previous reports using
comparable conditions. Thus, it appears that these three previously considered
factors could be overcome, and we propose that reducing the transfer volume to 1 
μl or less is essential for successful marmoset embryo transfer.

Treatment of common marmosets with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine
(MPTP; 1-4 mg/kg for up to 4 days) caused a profound parkinsonian state. Ten days
from the start of MPTP treatment, all animals showed marked motor impairment,
consisting of bradykinesia and akinesia, limb rigidity, postural abnormalities,
loss of vocalisation and blink reflex, and, on occasions, postural tremor.
Measurement of caudate-putamen monoamine content at this time showed a profound
loss in 3,4-dihydroxyphenylethylamine, homovanillic acid, and
3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid concentrations. Measurement of neuropeptide
concentrations in the caudate-putamen, internal and external segments of the
globus pallidus, nucleus accumbens, substantia nigra, frontal cortex, and
hippocampus showed met-enkephalin, leu-enkephalin, and cholecystokinin (CCK-8)
concentrations to be unaffected by MPTP treatment. There was a small decrease in 
the substance P content of frontal cortex, but otherwise the content of this
neuropeptide was unaltered. Parkinsonism in the marmoset, induced by MPTP
treatment 10 days earlier, does not alter neuropeptide concentrations in the
manner observed in Parkinson's disease.

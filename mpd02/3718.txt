The karyotypes of four marmoset species of the Callithrix jacchus group (C.
aurita, C. kuhlii, C. geoffroyi, and C. penicillata) were investigated. The
patterns of G-, C-, and NOR-bands of these karyotypes were compared with those of
C. jacchus, previously described, in order to clarify the taxonomic relationships
of this species group. All species present 2n = 46, 14 uni- and 30 biarmed
autosomes, a median size submetacentric X chromosome, and the same NOR-band
patterns. No rearrangement or constitutive heterochromatic variation
differentiate these species, which differ only in the morphology of the Y
chromosome. The data obtained indicate that, from the chromosomal point stand,
the marmoset species of C. jacchus group constitute a homogeneous clade.

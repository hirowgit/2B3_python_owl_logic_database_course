Preexisting neutralizing antibody (NAb) against human adenovirus serotype 5
(AdHu5) can reduce the immunogenicity of AdHu5 vector-based vaccine, thus
inhibiting the host's immune response and utility of other homologous vectors.
Common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a small new world primate, has attracted
considerable attention for its potential as a preclinical research model of
vaccine development. However, the prevalence of anti-AdHu5 NAb activity in common
marmosets bred in China remains unknown. A recombinant adenovirus expressing
luciferase and Zs Green reporter genes were constructed to detect NAb against
rAdHu5 by flow cytometry (FCM) and chemiluminescence (CL) assay. Five of 25
marmosets (20%) presented AdHu5 NAb detectable by FCM. Four animals had low titer
(1/16), while the fifth one reached 1/64. While by CL assay, 7 of 25 (28%)
marmosets were anti-AdHu5 NAb positive. Four animals, two of whom were negative
by FCM, also had low titer NAb (1/16), suggesting assay discrepancy at low
levels. Two marmosets, 1/32 titer by CL, were at 1/16 by FCM. A single animal
showed a high titer with both assays (1/128 and 1/64 by CL and FCM,
respectively). The CL method was simpler, more sensitive, accurate, and stable.
The low prevalence of preexisting anti-AdHu5 NAb in marmosets provides important 
background information on the feasibility and applicability of using marmosets as
a preclinical research model for vaccine development.

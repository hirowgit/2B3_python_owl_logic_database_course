Experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) is an animal model for the human
demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis (MS). Increased permeability of the
blood-brain barrier (BBB) precedes the development of clinical or pathologic
findings in MS and may be induced by perivascular brain mast cells secreting
vasoactive and proinflammatory molecules. Brain mast cells were investigated
ultrastructurally in acute EAE of the non-human primate common marmoset
Callithrix jacchus, which develops a mild neurologic relapsing-remitting course. 
Control diencephalic samples contained perivascular mast cells with mostly intact
electron dense granules. In contrast, EAE samples had marked demyelination and
mast cells with numerous altered secretory granules; their electron dense content
varied in amount and texture with a "honeycomb" or "target" appearance, but
without degranulation. These changes were evident even before the development of 
any clinical symptoms and suggest that brain mast cells may be involved in EAE,
and possibly MS, through a unique process that may involve selective secretion of
molecules able to disrupt the BBB.

Here, we compared the growth kinetics, cell-to-cell spread, and virus
internalization kinetics in N2a cells of RABV variants isolated from vampire bats
(V-3), domestic dogs (V-2) and marmosets (V-M) as well as the clinical symptoms
and mortality caused by these variants. The replication rate of V-3 was
significantly higher than those of V-2 and V-M. However, the uptake and spread of
these RABV variants into N2a cells were inversely proportional. Nevertheless, V-3
had longer incubation and evolution periods. Our results provide evidence that
the clinical manifestations of infection with bat RABV variant occur at a later
time when compared to what was observed with canine and marmoset rabies virus
variants.

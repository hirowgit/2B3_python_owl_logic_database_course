We are currently living the advent of a new age for medicine in which basic
research is being quickly translated into marketable drugs, and the widespread
access to genomics data is allowing the design and implementation of personalized
solutions to medical conditions. Non-human primates (NHP) have gained an
essential role in drug discovery and safety testing due to their close
phylogenetic relationship to humans. In this study, a collection of well
characterized genes of the human immune system was used to define the
orthology-based immunome in four NHP species, with carefully curated annotations 
available based on multi-tissue RNA-seq datasets. A broad variation in the
frequency of expressed protein isoforms was observed between species. Finally,
this analysis also revealed the lack of expression of at least four different
chemokines in new-world primates. In addition, transcripts corresponding to four 
genes including interleukin 12 subunit alpha were expressed in humans but no
other primate species analyzed. Access to the non-human primate immunome is
available in http://www.fidic.org.co:90/proyecto/.

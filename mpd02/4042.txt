The New World primates are relatively new to studies in reproductive health. The 
essential factors in their reproductive physiology and endocrinology are now
established for the three species considered here: Saimiri sciureus, Cebus
apella, and Callithrix jacchus. Our studies to date in C. jacchus have
concentrated on developmental biology (gametogenesis, fertilization,
implantation, neonatal growth) and on strategic studies of new pharmacological
agents for the regulation of fertility (vaccines, steroids, lactation). There are
also species-specific mechanisms evident, such as reproductive suppression in
female marmosets, that give insights to the evolution of reproductive mechanisms 
in the primates. © 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

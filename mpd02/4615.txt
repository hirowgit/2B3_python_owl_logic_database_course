Congenital malformations in a common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) similar to
human 13-trisomy syndrome.

Pugsley SL.

This paper describes the finding of a number of malformations in a live-born
common marmoset. The malformations included microphthalmia, ocular hypertelorism,
cleft lip and palate and polydactyly. The findings are consistent with and
strongly suggest chromosome trisomy similar to that which has been seen in man.

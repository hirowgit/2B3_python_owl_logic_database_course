Cooperation is central to human communication. The foundation of cooperative
verbal communication is taking turns to speak. Given the universality of
turn-taking, it is natural to ask how it evolved. We used marmoset monkeys to
explore whether another primate species exhibits cooperative vocal communication 
by taking turns. Marmosets share with humans a cooperative breeding strategy and 
volubility. Cooperative care behaviors are thought to scaffold prosocial
cognitive processes. Moreover, marmosets and other callitrichid primates are very
vocal and readily exchange vocalizations with conspecifics. By measuring the
natural statistics of marmoset vocal exchanges, we observed that they take turns 
in extended sequences and show that this vocal turn-taking has as its foundation 
dynamics characteristic of coupled oscillators--one that is similar to the
dynamics proposed for human conversational turn-taking. As marmoset monkeys are
on a different branch of the evolutionary tree that led to humans, our data
demonstrate convergent evolution of vocal cooperation. Perhaps more importantly, 
our data offer a plausible alternative scenario to "gestural origin" hypotheses
for how human cooperative vocal communication could have evolved.

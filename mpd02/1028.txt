Much has been written about hepatic metastasis and animal models abound. In terms
of the human experience, progress in treating this final common pathway, a
terminal event of many human malignancies has been relatively slow. The current
thinking is that primary prevention is best served by early detection of cancer
and eradication of early stage cancers by screening. Some cancers spread early in
their course and the role of screening may be limited. Until relatively recently 
there has not been a pathfinder model that makes the evasion of this unfortunate 
event a reality. This review discusses such an animal model and attempts to
relate it to human disease in terms of intervention. Concrete proposals are also 
offered on how scientists may be able to intervene to prevent this deadly
progression of the cancer process.

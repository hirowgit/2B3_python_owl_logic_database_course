BACKGROUND: Endometrial and cervical polyps are masses of endometrium or cervical
epithelium that bulge into the uterine or cervical lumen. The physiopathology and
contributing factors of endometrial polyps development are still unknown.
METHODS: Clinical and pathology records of 28 non-human primates with
histologically confirmed endometrial and cervical polyps were reviewed.
Twenty-one baboons with endometrial polyps were evaluated for age at diagnosis,
body weight, menstrual cycle length, presence of endometriosis and adenomyosis
and number of offspring, cesarean sections, and stillbirths.
RESULTS: Endometrial polyps in baboons were associated with increased age,
decreased menstrual cycle lengths, endometriosis, and decreased parity. No
differences were found for weight, adenomyosis, or number of cesarean sections or
stillbirths.
CONCLUSIONS: Baboons are a promising model for the study of endometrial polyps
because of their similarity to humans in both the development of endometrial
polyps and association of many of the same risk factors.

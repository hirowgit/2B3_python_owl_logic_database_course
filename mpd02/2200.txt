We report here for the first time the isolation and identification of the common 
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) huntingtin (Htt) gene, whose ortholog in humans is 
known to be related to Huntington's disease (HD). A 9396 nucleotide complementary
DNA (cDNA) carrying the putative full-length open reading frame of the marmoset
Htt gene was identified, and highly conserved nucleotide and amino acid sequences
among primates were observed. Based on this data and using tools evaluated for
the detection of the marmoset Htt gene, we have demonstrated gene silencing
against the expression of endogenous Htt gene in immortalized common marmoset
mononuclear cells by means of RNA interference (RNAi). Taken together, the data
presented here may assist us in realizing a non-human primate HD model with the
common marmoset.

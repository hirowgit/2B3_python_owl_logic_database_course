BACKGROUND: Marmosets in captivity are highly susceptible to wasting marmoset
syndrome (WMS), the aetiology of which is still not fully determined.
METHODS: The level of IgA-gliadin antibodies (IgA-AGA), of IgA-containing
circulating immune complexes (IgA-CIC), and the degree of glomerular IgA deposits
were compared between marmosets suffering from WMS and animals not affected by
the disorder.
RESULTS: Both IgA-AGA and IgA-CIC were demonstrable in all groups of monkeys
investigated. IgA-AGA and IgA-CIC were significantly higher in monkeys with WMS
than in non-affected animals. There was a significant correlation between the
glomerular IgA-deposition and titre of IgA-AGA. The group of marmosets strongly
positive for glomerular IgA deposits comprised significantly more animals
suffering from WMS than the group without deposits. In the diet of the animals a 
considerable amount of gliadin-like cereal proteins was assayed.
CONCLUSIONS: There are several parallels between the human disorders (coeliac
disease and IgA-nephropathy/Berger's disease) and the changes observed in WMS. It
should be further investigated if WMS in marmosets is a suitable animal model for
both human diseases.

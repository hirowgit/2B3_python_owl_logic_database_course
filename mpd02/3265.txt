A 394-bp DNA fragment, which in human is on chromosome 6 near the MOG (myelin
oligodendrocyte glycoprotein) gene and encompasses an Alu element and an
associated tetranucleotide microsatellite, was sequenced from a large range of
primate species to follow its evolutionary divergence and to understand the
origin of the microsatellite. This Alu element is found at the same orthologous
position in all primates sequenced, but the tetranucleotide repeat is present
only in Catarrhini between the 3'-oligo(dA) of the Alu element and the 3'
flanking direct repeat. Little intraspecific variation was found. Sequence
identity values for this orthologous primate Alu averaged 90% (82-99%) with
transitions comprising between 70% and 100% of the observed nucleotide
substitutions. Although the insertion of the Alu element predates the separation 
of these species, the original sequence of the site of integration can still be
identified. This identification of the direct repeats suggests an active role of 
the oligo(dA) of the Alu element in the origin of the tetranucleotide repeats.
The microsatellite probably appeared after the insertion of the Alu element,
early in the lineage leading to the common ancestor of the hominoids and the Old 
World monkeys.

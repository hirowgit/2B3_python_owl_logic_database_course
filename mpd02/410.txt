Optogenetics is now a fundamental tool for investigating the relationship between
neuronal activity and behavior. However, its application to the investigation of 
motor control systems in nonhuman primates is rather limited, because optogenetic
stimulation of cortical neurons in nonhuman primates has failed to induce or
modulate any hand/arm movements. Here, we used a tetracycline-inducible gene
expression system carrying CaMKII promoter and the gene encoding a
Channelrhodopsin-2 variant with fast kinetics in the common marmoset, a small New
World monkey. In an awake state, forelimb movements could be induced when
Channelrhodopsin-2-expressing neurons in the motor cortex were illuminated by
blue laser light with a spot diameter of 1 mm or 2 mm through a cranial window
without cortical invasion. Forelimb muscles responded 10 ms to 50 ms after
photostimulation onset. Long-duration (500 ms) photostimulation induced discrete 
forelimb movements that could be markerlessly tracked with charge-coupled device 
cameras and a deep learning algorithm. Long-duration photostimulation mapping
revealed that the primary motor cortex is divided into multiple domains that can 
induce hand and elbow movements in different directions. During performance of a 
forelimb movement task, movement trajectories were modulated by weak
photostimulation, which did not induce visible forelimb movements at rest, around
the onset of task-relevant movement. The modulation was biased toward the
movement direction induced by the strong photostimulation. Combined with calcium 
imaging, all-optical interrogation of motor circuits should be possible in
behaving marmosets.

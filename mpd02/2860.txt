Twin, white-fronted marmosets (Callithrix geoffroyi) born and raised in a zoo in 
Japan died at 7 mo of age. Several encapsulated nematode larvae were detected in 
the intestinal wall, as well as a few in the mesenteric lymph nodes of 1 of the
twins. In the other marmoset, no encapsulated nematode larva was detected in the 
organs, but many adult Pterygodermatites nycticebi were found in the intestinal
lumen. In the past 5 yr, 5 primates kept in the same zoo, i.e., 1 squirrel monkey
(Saimiri sciureus), 2 Pygmy marmosets (Cebuella pygmaea), 1 Senegal galago
(Galago senegalensis), and 1 cotton-top tamarin (Saguinus oedipus), died from
heavy infestation with the same nematode. A few migrating larvae of the
rictulariid were also identified histologically in the intestinal wall and liver 
of the cotton-top tamarin. Although no other primate currently held in the same
zoo was infected with the rictulariid, German cockroaches (Blattella germanica)
collected with traps near marmoset cages had encapsulated P. nycticebi larvae,
indicating latent perpetuation of the life cycle of this rictulariid species in
the zoo premises. Our results indicated that encapsulation or migration of
third-stage larvae of P. nycticebi might occur accidentally in the organs of
callithrichid primates.

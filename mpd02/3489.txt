P/midget ganglion cells mediate red-green color opponency in anthropoids. It has 
been proposed that these cells evolved as a specialization to subserve color
vision in primates. If that is correct, they must have evolved about the same
time as the long-wavelength ('red') and medium-wavelength ('green') pigment genes
diverged, thirty million years ago. Strepsirhines are another group of primates
that diverged from the ancestor of the anthropoids at least 55 million years ago.
If P/midget ganglion cells evolved to subserve color vision, they should be
absent in strepsirhines. We tested this hypothesis in a nocturnal strepsirhine,
the greater bush baby Otolemur. The retinal ganglion cells were labeled with the 
lipophilic tracer Dil and the results show that bush babies have P/midget and
M/parasol cells similar to those found in the peripheral retinas of anthropoids. 
A number of studies have shown that the P and M pathways of bush babies share
many similarities with those of anthropoids, and our results show that the same
is true for their retinal ganglion cells. These results support the hypothesis
that the P system evolved prior to the emergence of red-green color opponency.

Human T-cell leukemia virus: transformation in vitro of nonhuman primate
T-lymphocytes and experimental inoculation of nonhuman primates.

Falk LA Jr, Byington R, Silva DP.

T-lymphocytes from three species of New World monkeys were susceptible to
transformation in vitro with human T-cell leukemia virus. Marmoset T-lymphocytes 
transformed in vitro with HVS or HVA, T-lymphotropic herpesviruses of New World
monkeys, were also transformed with HTLV resulting in doubly transformed T-cells.
This finding may provide a potential model for investigating the possible
interaction between a herpesvirus and T-lymphotropic retroviruses in the clinical
condition AIDS.

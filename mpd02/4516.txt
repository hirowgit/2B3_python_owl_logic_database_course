Long-term data on the reproduction and maintenance of a colony of common
marmosets (Callithrix jacchus jacchus) 1972-1983.

Box HO, Hubrecht RC.

We have used our laboratory records to compare data on the reproduction and
maintenance of common marmosets in different colonies and to provide additional
information on the species in captivity. Data are presented for a period of 12
years. This was long enough to allow information on longevity, mortality,
aggression and incest. In addition 543 infants were born from a total of 202
births. No seasonality was found and the highest proportion of births overall was
that of triplets. A significantly greater proportion of males was born, but
perinatal mortality reduced this to a proportion of 52.2% surviving males. The
interbirth interval for all normal births ranged from 145 to 382 days, with a
median of 158 days. There was no evidence that interbirth intervals increased
with age. The proportion of non-breeding pairs was small (4 out of 28) and
progesterone assays showed that these females were ovulating.

In adult animals, movement and vocalizations are coordinated, sometimes
facilitating, and at other times inhibiting, each other. What is missing is how
these different domains of motor control become coordinated over the course of
development. We investigated how postural-locomotor behaviors may influence vocal
development, and the role played by physiological arousal during their
interactions. Using infant marmoset monkeys, we densely sampled vocal, postural
and locomotor behaviors and estimated arousal fluctuations from
electrocardiographic measures of heart rate. We found that vocalizations matured 
sooner than postural and locomotor skills, and that vocal-locomotor coordination 
improved with age and during elevated arousal levels. These results suggest that 
postural-locomotor maturity is not required for vocal development to occur, and
that infants gradually improve coordination between vocalizations and body
movement through a process that may be facilitated by arousal level changes.

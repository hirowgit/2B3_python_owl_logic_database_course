The typical daily water intake of common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) in a
research setting has not been well characterized. Because these New World
primates are in demand as animal models for neurobehavioral experiments, which
can include the potential use of fluid regulation for training, veterinary and
research staff need to understand how marmosets keep hydrated under normal
circumstances. In the current study, we measured the water consumption of older
(age, 5 to 12 y; n = 11) and younger (age, 1 to 2 y; n = 11) marmosets every 3 h 
during the 12-h light phase in 2 different months (January and July). The overall
daily water intake (mean ± 1 SD) was 61.3 ± 20.4 mL/kg (range, 36.3 to 99.0
mL/kg); water intake by an individual marmoset or cohoused pair was fairly
consistent from day to day. Water intake did not change across the four 3-h
periods measured during the day, and minimal water was consumed overnight when
the room lights were off. In addition, daily water intake did not differ between 
the 2 mo of measurements. Older animals drank significantly more than the younger
group, and weight was directly correlated with water intake. Water intake was not
affected by body condition score or housing status. The variation in water
consumption among marmosets underscores the need for individualization of fluid
regulation guidelines.

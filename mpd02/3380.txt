Glycine is a major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian retina and has
been shown to influence the responses of ganglion cells. Midget and parasol
ganglion cells serve distinct physiological roles in the primate retina and show 
differences in their response characteristics to light stimuli. In the present
study, we addressed the question of whether the expression of glycine receptors
differs in midget and parasol ganglion cells. Ganglion cells in the retinae of
marmoset and macaque monkeys were injected with Neurobiotin in a live in vitro
retinal whole-mount preparation. Retinal pieces were then processed with an
antibody against the alpha1 subunit of the glycine receptor. Strong punctate
immunoreactivity indicative of synaptic localization is present in the ON and OFF
sublamina of the inner plexiform layer. Many of the immunoreactive puncta
coincide with the dendrites of both midget and parasol ganglion cells.
Immunoreactive puncta are present on distal and proximal dendrites of ON and OFF 
cells. These results suggest that ON and OFF midget and parasol cells do not
differ with respect to the distribution of the alpha1 subunit of the glycine
receptor.

Proceptive displays of the female common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus): effects
of ovariectomy and oestradiol 17 beta.

Dixson AF.

Proceptivity in the common marmoset consisted of brief periods when females
remained with body and limbs immobile (IM) or crouched, and then stared,
lipsmacked and tongue-flicked at males. Treatment of ovariectomized females with 
oestradiol activated all these proceptive displays but did not influence the
combinations in which they occurred during IM periods.

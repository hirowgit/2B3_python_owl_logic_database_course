Adult retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) can regenerate their axons in vitro. Using
proteomics, we discovered that the supernatants of cultured retinas contain
isoforms of crystallins with crystallin beta b2 (crybb2) being clearly
up-regulated in the regenerating retina. Immunohistochemistry revealed the
expression of crybb within the retina, including in filopodial protrusions and
axons of RGCs. Cloning and overexpression of crybb2 in RGCs and hippocampal
neurons increased axonogenesis, which in turn could be blocked with antibodies
against beta-crystallin. Conditioned medium from crybb2-transfected cell cultures
also supported the growth of axons. Finally real time imaging of the uptake of
green fluorescent protein-tagged crybb2 fusion protein showed that this protein
becomes internalized. These data are the first to show that axonal regeneration
is related to crybb2 movement. The results suggest that neuronal crystallins
constitute a novel class of neurite-promoting factors that likely operate through
an autocrine mechanism and that they could be used in neurodegenerative diseases.

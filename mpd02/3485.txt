The molecular mechanisms underlying myelin sheath destruction in multiple
sclerosis lesions remain unresolved. With immunogold-labeled peptides of myelin
antigens and high-resolution microscopy, techniques that can detect
antigen-specific antibodies in situ, we have identified autoantibodies specific
for the central nervous system myelin antigen myelin/oligodendrocyte
glycoprotein. These autoantibodies were specifically bound to disintegrating
myelin around axons in lesions of acute multiple sclerosis and the marmoset model
of allergic encephalomyelitis. These findings represent direct evidence that
autoantibodies against a specific myelin protein mediate target membrane damage
in central nervous system demyelinating disease.

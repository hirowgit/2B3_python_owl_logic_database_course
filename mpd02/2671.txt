The distribution pattern of SMI-32-immunoreactivity (SMI-32-ir) of neuronal
elements was examined in the visual cortical areas of marmoset monkey. Layer IV
of the primary visual cortex (V1) and layers III and V of the extrastriate areas 
showed the most abundant SMI-32-ir. The different areal and laminar distribution 
of SMI-32-ir allowed the distinction between various extrastriate areas and
determined their exact anatomical boundaries in the New World monkey, Callithrix 
penicillata. It is shown here that the parcellating nature of SMI-32 described
earlier in the visual cortical areas of other mammals - including Old World
monkeys - is also present in the marmoset. Furthermore, a comparison became
possible between the chemoanatomical organization of New World and Old World
primates' visual cortical areas.

The aim of this study was to determine whether marmoset monkeys are a suitable
primate model for in vitro fertilization (IVF), embryo culture, and
transplantation studies. A prostaglandin analogue given in early pregnancy and
human chorionic gonadotropin given near the end of the ensuing follicular phase
were used for controlling the reproductive cycle, timing oocyte collection, and
synchronizing the cycles of oocyte donors and embryo recipients. Five embryos
obtained by IVF were transferred at early stages to the uterus of three
recipients, and two gave birth to live infants. Some of the embryos were cultured
to advanced blastocyst stages. In vivo fertilized oocytes were also cultured and 
transferred to two recipients, and one gave birth. We concluded that the marmoset
is one of the best primates for such investigations.

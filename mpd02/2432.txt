BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The role of nitric oxide (NO) in cardiac pathophysiology 
remains controversial. According to data from several studies using rat and
rabbit isolated hearts, NO is an endogenous cardioprotectant against
reperfusion-induced ventricular fibrillation (VF). Thus, if cardiac NO production
is abolished by perfusion with L-N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methylester (L-NAME) (100 
microM) there is a concomittant increase in the incidence of reperfusion-induced 
VF, with L-NAME's effects on NO and VF prevented by L- (but not D-) arginine
co-perfusion. To make a better estimate of the clinical relevance of these
findings, 100 microM L-NAME was tested in primate hearts under similar
conditions.
EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Marmoset (Callithrix jaccus) hearts, isolated and
perfused, were subjected to 60 min left regional ischaemia followed by 10 min
reperfusion in vitro. The ECG was recorded and NO in coronary effluent measured
by chemiluminescence.
KEY RESULTS: L-NAME (100 micro M) decreased NO in coronary effluent throughout
ischaemia and reperfusion (e.g. from 3720+/-777 pmol min(-1) g(-1) in controls to
699+/-98 pmol min(-1) g(-1) after 5 min of ischaemia) and, during ischaemia,
lowered coronary flow and reduced heart rate, actions identical to those seen in 
rat and rabbit hearts. However, the incidence of reperfusion-induced VF was
unchanged (20%, with or without L-NAME).
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: A species difference exists in the effectiveness of
endogenous NO to protect hearts against reperfusion-induced VF. The present
primate data, which presumably take precedence over rat and rabbit data, cast
doubt on the clinical relevance of NO as an endogenous, antiarrhythmic,
cardioprotectant.

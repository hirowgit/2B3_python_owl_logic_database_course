Trypanosoma minasense was isolated for the first time in blood axenic culture
from a naturally infected marmoset, Callithrix penicillata, from Brazil. The
parasite grew profusely in an overlay of Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium
plus 20% foetal bovine serum, on Novy, McNeal and Nicolle medium (NNN), at 27
degrees C, with a peak around 168 hr. The morphometry of cultural forms of T.
minasense, estimates of cell population size and comparative growth in four
different media overlays always with NNN, were studied. The infectivity of
cultural forms to marmosets (C. penicillata and C. jacchus) and transformation of
epimastigotes into metacyclic-like forms in axenic culture in the presence of
chitin derivates (chitosan) were evaluated.

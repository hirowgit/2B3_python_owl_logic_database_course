OBJECTIVE: Common marmosets are considered experimental animals of primates
useful for medical research. We developed several monoclonal antibodies (mAbs)
directed to CD molecules to gain initial insight into the immune and
hematopoietic systems of this organism, and analyzed the basic cellularity and
characters of marmoset lymphocytes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Anti-marmoset CD antigen mAbs were prepared using marmoset
antigen-expressing transfectants and used for flow cytometric analyses and cell
fractionation. Expression of T-cell-related cytokine gene transcripts was
examined in response to T-cell receptor stimulation by reverse transcription
polymerase chain reaction analyses. Hematopoietic progenitor activities of
marmoset bone marrow cells were examined in fractionated cells by mAbs against
CD117 (c-kit) and CD34.
RESULTS: CD4 and CD8 expression profiles in T-cell subsets of marmoset were
essentially similar to those in mouse and human. CD4(+) and CD8(+) subsets were
isolated from marmoset spleens. Detected transcripts after stimulation of T cells
included Th1-, Th2-, and Th17-related cytokines in CD4(+) cells and cytotoxic
proteases in CD8(+) cells, respectively. Colony-forming abilities were detected
mainly in CD117 (c-kit)(+) cells, irrespective of CD34 expression.
CONCLUSIONS: Marmoset immune system was basically similar to human and mouse
systems.

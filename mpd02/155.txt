Curiosity is a fundamental nature of animals for adapting to changing
environments, but its underlying brain circuits and mechanisms remain poorly
understood. One main barrier is that existing studies use rewards to train
animals and motivate their engagement in behavioral tasks. As such, the rewards
become significant confounders in interpreting curiosity. Here, we overcame this 
problem by studying research-naïve and naturally curious marmosets that can
proactively and persistently participate in a visual choice task without external
rewards. When performing the task, the marmosets manifested a strong innate
preference towards acquiring new information, associated with faster behavioral
responses. Longitudinally functional magnetic resonance imaging revealed
behavior-relevant brain states that reflected choice preferences and engaged
several brain regions, including the cerebellum, the hippocampus, and cortical
areas 19DI, 25, and 46D, with the cerebellum being the most prominent. These
results unveil the essential brain circuits and dynamics underlying
curiosity-driven activity.

In assessing plasma concentrations of drugs in relation to neuroprotective
effect, emphasis should be placed on measured or calculated concentrations during
the window of opportunity for effect, rather than at the end of the experiment.
Unbound (plasma free) concentrations should be especially considered as should
brain penetration to the stroked area. Problem-solving exercises should include
post hoc assessment of dosing residues and proof of exposure. The shape of the
graph of response versus concentration in plasma is very steep, giving the
impression of an all-or-none effect. Although higher doses lead to greater
effects, attempts to statistically correlate plasma level and infarct size are
likely to be unsuccessful. There is strong evidence that the pharmacokinetic
properties of drugs are affected by the physiological consequences of ischemia.

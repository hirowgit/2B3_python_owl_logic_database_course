In the course of characterizing the distribution of putative catecholaminergic
neurons in the brain of the common marmoset, we encountered a population of such 
cells in the basal forebrain. Tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive neurons are
abundant within the nucleus basalis magnocellularis throughout its entire
rostrocaudal extent, but not in other cholinergic basal forebrain nuclei. Most
tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive cells are large and multipolar. Double
staining with antibodies to choline acetyltransferase or nerve growth factor
receptor confirmed that these tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive neurons are
cholinergic, and compose at least 40% of the nucleus basalis cholinergic cells.
The presence of a catecholamine-synthesizing enzyme in the neurons that provide
the major cholinergic input to the neocortex may have important consequences for 
cortical function, and may be relevant to the vulnerability of the nucleus
basalis in certain neurodegenerative disorders.

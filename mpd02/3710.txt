The relation between number of ovulations and body weight, age or maternal
identity was examined in 69 ovarian cycles from 29 captive-born common marmoset
monkeys (Callithrix jacchus). Specifically, we addressed the following questions:
was there high repeatability of ovulation number? Most of the variation in
ovulation number was within, rather than between subjects. Repeatability in
number of ovulations was 0.081 (n = 20 females with 2-6 ovulatory cycles per
female); was age related to number of ovulations? There was no relation between
age and number of ovulations, either within or between subjects; and was weight
related to number of ovulations? Weight was related to number of ovulations. When
the relation between number of ovulations (1-2 versus 3-4) and weight was
examined through a logistic regression, there was a significant relation. Also,
of the 11 subjects which had a variable number of ovulations across cycles, 90.9%
were heavier when ovulating 3-4 than when ovulating 2. These results are
discussed as the basis for the proposal that callitrichid primates may have been 
selected for potential variation in reproductive output and that this variation
may be related to energy availability.

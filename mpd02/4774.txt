An outbreak of hepatitis in marmosets in a zoological collection.

Lucke VM, Bennett AM.

12 marmosets of 3 different species died of hepatitis during a period of 5
months. The lesions closely resembled those of virus hepatitis in man but
material from these animals and from in-contact marmosets failed to reveal the
presence of hepatitis A. This together with certain aspects of the epidemiology
of the disease suggests that the outbreak was not caused by a virus of human
origin but possibly by a virus indigenous to the marmoset or tamarin.

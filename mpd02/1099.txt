1. Common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a New World Monkey, has potential to be 
a useful animal model in preclinical studies. However, drug metabolizing
properties have not been fully understood due to insufficient information on
cytochrome P450 (P450), major drug metabolizing enzymes. 2. Marmoset P450 2J2
cDNA was isolated from marmoset livers. The deduced amino acid sequence showed a 
high-sequence identity (91%) with cynomolgus monkey and human P450 2J2 enzymes. A
phylogenetic tree revealed that marmoset P450 2J2 was evolutionarily closer to
cynomolgus monkey and human P450 2J2 enzymes, than P450 2J forms in pigs,
rabbits, rats or mice. 3. Marmoset P450 2J2 mRNA was abundantly expressed in the 
small intestine and liver, and to a lesser extent in the brain, lung and kidney. 
Immunoblot analysis also showed expression of marmoset P450 2J2 protein in the
small intestine and liver. 4. Enzyme assays using marmoset P450 2J2 protein
heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli indicated that marmoset P450 2J2
effectively catalyzed astemizole O-demethylation and terfenadine t-butyl
hydroxylation, similar to human and cynomolgus monkey P450 2J2 enzymes. 5. These 
results suggest the functional characteristics of P450 2J2 enzymes are similar
among marmosets, cynomolgus monkeys and humans.

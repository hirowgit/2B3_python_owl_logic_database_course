Immunization of common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) with a single dose of human
myelin in CFA, without administration of Bordetella pertussis, induces a form of 
autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) resembling in its clinical and pathological
expression multiple sclerosis in humans. The EAE incidence in our outbred
marmoset colony is 100%. This study was undertaken to assess the genetic and
immunological basis of the high EAE susceptibility. To this end, we determined
the separate contributions of immune reactions to myelin/oligodendrocyte
glycoprotein (MOG) and myelin basic protein to the EAE induction. Essentially all
pathological features of myelin-induced EAE were also found in animals immunized 
with MOG in CFA, whereas in animals immunized with myelin basic protein in CFA
clinical and pathological signs of EAE were lacking. The epitope recognition by
anti-MOG Abs and T cells were assessed. Evidence is provided that the initiation 
of EAE is based on T and B cell activation by the encephalitogenic phMOG14-36
peptide in the context of monomorphic Caja-DRB*W1201 molecules.

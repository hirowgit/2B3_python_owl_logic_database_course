This study is based on a mixed longitudinal radiographic sampling of appendicular
bones in 82 captive-born squirrel monkeys (Saimiri boliviensis). All appendicular
ossification centers had appeared radiographically by 17 weeks of age, and
epiphyseal fusion was complete by 47-53 months of age. No statistically
significant differences were found between the sexes in comparisons carried out
at birth and at 6 and 8 months of age. Valid sex comparisons could not be made at
other ages owing to the small size of the sample. The sequence of appearance of
the ossification centers (Spearman correlation coefficient of Saimiri vs.
Callithrix = 0.68) shows greater interspecies differences than the sequence of
fusion (Saimiri vs. Callithrix = 0.88).

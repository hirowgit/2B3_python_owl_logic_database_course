BACKGROUND: Dysfunction of the cellular antioxidant system and accumulation of
reactive oxygen species are involved in the pathophysiology of diseases such as
cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative disorders, tumors, male infertility and
aging. Two gluthathione peroxidases play key roles in the cellular protection
against oxidative damage. Glutathione peroxidase (GPx-1) removes cytosolic
hydroperoxides while phospholipid-hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (GPx-4) is
a unique enzyme that reduces phospholipid peroxides in membranes.
METHODS: We cloned and sequenced the full-length cDNA for GPx-1 (GenBank:
AY966403) and GPx-4 (GenBank: AY966404) from the common marmoset (Callithrix
jacchus) in order to create a suitable model for studying human diseases related 
with oxidative stress.
RESULTS: The cDNAs encode a 202 amino acid protein for GPx-1 and a 197 amino acid
protein for GPx-4. Both proteins include selenocysteine (Sec, in Gpx-1 at
position 48; in GPx-4 at position 73) and showed high homology (>90%) with other 
mammalian GPxs. The relative levels of mRNA expression for GPx-1 and GPx-4 were
determined in different marmoset tissues by quantitative real-time reverse
transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction using transcription elongation factor-2
as a reference gene. GPx-1 showed increased levels of expression in the liver,
heart and kidney while the highest mRNA levels for GPx-4 were detected in the
testis, followed by the liver, lung, kidney and spinal cord.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings will be of value for studies designed to assess the
role of glutathione peroxidases in non-human primate models for a variety of
diseases in which increased oxidative stress has been implicated.

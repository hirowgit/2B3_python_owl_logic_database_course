Six long-term ovariectomized adult marmoset monkeys were treated at 0 h with 35
micrograms oestradiol benzoate s.c. to induce an LH surge. They were also treated
with detirelix (an LHRH antagonist) at 0 h, 12 h and 24 h (Exp. 1), or at 0 h and
24 h (Exp. 2) at a dose of 300 micrograms/kg s.c., or received the detirelix
vehicle alone at 0 h, 12 h and 24 h (Exp. 3). All animals received the three
treatments, with at least 4 weeks between experiments. Blood samples were
collected at 0 h and at 6-12 h intervals for 72 h after oestradiol for the
determination of plasma LH by bioassay. In control animals, oestrogen treatment
resulted in a decline in plasma LH from 30.0 +/- 5.8 at 0 h to 12.8 +/- 2.6 ng/ml
at 6 h (negative feedback), followed by a positive feedback surge, reaching a
maximum of 148.0 +/- 34.6 ng/ml at 24 h. Values then declined to pretreatment
levels by 56 h. In contrast, antagonist-treated animals showed complete abolition
of the expected increase at 24 h, the low levels of the negative feedback phase
being maintained for 36-72 h. These results show that hypothalamic LHRH release
is essential during the oestrogen-induced LH surge, and that a direct
oestrogen-induced component at the pituitary level is not expressed in the
absence of LHRH in the marmoset.

Experiments in MPTP-treated non-human primates testing potential antiparkinsonian
action have shown both, beneficial and adverse effects of gutamate receptor
antagonists. To investigate this matter further, the novel competitive NMDA
antagonist CGP40.116 was administered systemically to three adult MPTP-treated
marmosets. When coadministered subcutaneously with a subthreshold dose of L-DOPA,
2 mg/kg, CGP40.116 25-250 micrograms/kg, increased locomotor activity. However,
when administered alone, CGP40.116 had no effect on locomotor activity.

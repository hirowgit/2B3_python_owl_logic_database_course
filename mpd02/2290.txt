Marmoset experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) has previously been
shown to replicate the essential features of both white matter and grey matter
lesions of MS. This study set out to investigate whether cortical atrophy occurs 
in marmoset EAE and whether cortical thinning is related to the presence of
focal, demyelinated cortical lesions. Seventeen leucocortical lesions and 13
subpial lesions were identified in 6 EAE cases. Cortical thickness surrounding
these lesions was recorded and compared with matched cortical areas from five
control animals. We found a diffuse 13-21% loss of cortical thickness in all
areas of EAE cortex compared with control animals but there was no additional
loss seen in demyelinated versus myelinated EAE cortex. These findings could not 
be accounted for by effects of age, sex and disease duration. We conclude that
localised cortical demyelination is not responsible for the major part of the
atrophy observed and that cortical thinning is largely due to more diffuse or
more remote factors. Marmoset EAE is an invaluable tool which can be used to
further investigate the cause and the substrate of cortical loss in demyelinating
diseases.

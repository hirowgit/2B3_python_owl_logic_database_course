The first draft of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) genome was published 
by the Marmoset Genome Sequencing and Analysis Consortium. The draft was based on
whole-genome shotgun sequencing, and the current assembly version is
Callithrix_jacches-3.2.1, but there still exist 187,214 undetermined gap regions 
and supercontigs and relatively short contigs that are unmapped to chromosomes in
the draft genome. We performed resequencing and assembly of the genome of common 
marmoset by deep sequencing with high-throughput sequencing technology. Several
different sequence runs using Illumina sequencing platforms were executed, and
181 Gbp of high-quality bases including mate-pairs with long insert lengths of 3,
8, 20, and 40 Kbp were obtained, that is, approximately 60× coverage. The
resequencing significantly improved the MGSAC draft genome sequence. The N50 of
the contigs, which is a statistical measure used to evaluate assembly quality,
doubled. As a result, 51% of the contigs (total length: 299 Mbp) that were
unmapped to chromosomes in the MGSAC draft were merged with chromosomal contigs, 
and the improved genome sequence helped to detect 5,288 new genes that are
homologous to human cDNAs and the gaps in 5,187 transcripts of the Ensembl gene
annotations were completely filled.

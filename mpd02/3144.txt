Captive callitrichids are prone to developing intestinal problems. Their captive 
and natural diets differ enormously, and diet has been suggested to play a major 
role in wasting marmoset syndrome. Proteins in wheat, soy and milk are included
in callitrichid diets of most colonies and have been linked to an immune reaction
in Saguinus oedipus and Callithrix jacchus. In the present study of 23 males and 
females of the two species, wheat protein was tested but soy and milk products
were excluded. One group had wheat and the other had rice in their diet. Blood
samples and biopsies from the colon were taken. Results showed changes in the
colon and an immune reaction to gliadin, a wheat protein related to coeliac
disease in humans. A further immune reaction was also observed. Suggestions for
further study and exclusion of cereal in the diet of these small, New World
primates are discussed.

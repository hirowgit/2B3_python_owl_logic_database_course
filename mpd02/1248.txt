Burkholderia mallei is a host-adapted bacterium that does not persist outside of 
its equine reservoir. The organism causes the zoonosis glanders, which is endemic
in Asia, Africa, the Middle East and South America. Infection by B. mallei
typically occurs via the respiratory or percutaneous route, and the most common
manifestations are life-threatening pneumonia and bacteremia. Glanders is
difficult to diagnose and requires prolonged antibiotic therapy with low success 
rates. There is no vaccine to protect against B. mallei and there is concern
regarding its use as a biothreat agent. Thus, experiments were performed to
establish a non-human primate model of intranasal infection to study the organism
and develop countermeasures. Groups of marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) were
inoculated intranasally with B. mallei strain ATCC 23344 and monitored for
clinical signs of illness for up to 13 days. We discovered that 83% of marmosets 
inoculated with doses of 2.5 X 10(4) to 2.5 X 10(5) bacteria developed acute
lethal infection within 3-4 days. Signs of disease were severe and included
lethargy, inappetence, conjunctivitis, mucopurulent and hemorrhagic nasal
discharges, and increased respiratory effort with abdominal lifts. Burkholderia
mallei was cultured from the lungs, spleen and liver of these animals, and
pathologic examination of tissues revealed lesions characteristic of glanders.
Challenge experiments also revealed that 91% of animals infected with doses
ranging from 25 to 2.5 X 10(3) bacteria exhibited mild non-specific signs of
illness and were culture negative. One marmoset inoculated with 2.5 X 10(3)
organisms developed moderate signs of disease and reached humane end-points 8
days post-infection. The liver and spleen of this animal were colonized with the 
agent and pathological analysis of tissues showed nasal, splenic and hepatic
lesions. Taken together, these data indicate that the marmoset is a suitable
model to study respiratory infection by B. mallei.

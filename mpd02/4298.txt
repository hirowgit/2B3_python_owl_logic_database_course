1. The effects of renin inhibitor ES-8891 on renin synthesis and its secretion by
the kidney were investigated in normotensive sodium-depleted marmosets. We
measured plasma renin activity, plasma immunoreactive renin concentration, plasma
angiotensin II concentration and kidney renin mRNA content after oral
administration of ES-8891 (60 mg day-1 kg-1) for 1 week. 2. The mean blood
pressure was significantly decreased (P less than 0.01) on day 7 after oral
administration of ES-8891. There was no significant change in heart rate during
the administration. 3. Oral administration of ES-8891 for 1 week markedly
decreased the plasma renin activity, the plasma immunoreactive renin
concentration and the plasma angiotensin II concentration (to 18%, 41% and 24% of
the corresponding control values; P less than 0.05 for each, n = 5). 4. The
kidney renin mRNA content in ES-8891-treated marmosets was significantly lower
than that in normal controls (4.2 +/- 3.5 versus 12.8 +/- 5.5 pg/micrograms of
total RNA, means +/- SD, P less than 0.05, n = 5). 5. Oral administration of the 
renin inhibitor ES-8891 for 1 week not only inhibited plasma renin activity but
also decreased renin synthesis and its secretion by the kidney.

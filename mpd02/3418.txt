Two types of cone bipolar cells, the blue cone bipolar cell and the diffuse
bipolar cell (DB3), were labelled immunohistochemically and investigated in the
retina of a New World monkey, the marmoset. Blue cone bipolar cells were labelled
with an antiserum against cholecystokinin. Short-wavelength-sensitive (SWS) cones
were labelled with an antiserum against the SWS cone opsin. The DB3 cells were
labelled with antibodies to calbindin. Blue cone bipolar cells in marmoset do not
form a regular mosaic but instead follow the random distribution of the SWS
cones. Nevertheless, the SWS cone to blue cone bipolar cell connectivity in
marmoset is very similar to that previously described for macaque. In contrast to
the blue cone bipolar cells, the DB3 cells form a regular mosaic. The synaptic
connectivity of DB3 cells in the inner plexiform layer was analyzed. They make
output synapses onto ganglion cells and amacrine cells, and gap junctions with
each other. Our results provide further evidence for the existence of parallel
bipolar cell pathways in the primate retina and support the view that the retinae
of Old World and New World primates have common neuronal connectivity. The random
distribution of SWS cones and blue cone bipolar cells is an exception to the
general rule of a regular mosaic distribution of cell populations in the retina.

The common marmoset is a new world primate belonging to the Callitrichidae family
weighing between 350 and 400 g. The marmoset has been shown to be an outstanding 
model for studying aging, reproduction, neuroscience, toxicology, and infectious 
disease. With regard to their susceptibility to infectious agents, they are
exquisite NHP models for viral, protozoan and bacterial agents, as well as
prions. The marmoset provides the advantages of a small animal model in high
containment coupled with the immunological repertoire of a nonhuman primate and
susceptibility to wild type, non-adapted viruses.

The primate brain contains a large number of interconnected visual areas, whose
spatial organization and intracortical projections show a high level of
conservation across species. One fiber pathway of recent interest is the vertical
occipital fasciculus (VOF), which is thought to support communication between
dorsal and ventral visual areas in the occipital lobe. A recent comparative
diffusion MRI (dMRI) study reported that the VOF in the macaque brain bears a
similar topology to that of the human, running superficial and roughly
perpendicular to the optic radiation. The present study reports a comparative
investigation of the VOF in the common marmoset, a small New World monkey whose
lissencephalic brain is approximately tenfold smaller than the macaque and
150-fold smaller than the human. High-resolution ex vivo dMRI of two marmoset
brains revealed an occipital white matter structure that closely resembles that
of the larger primate species, with one notable difference. Namely, unlike in the
macaque and the human, the VOF in the marmoset is spatially fused with other,
more anterior vertical tracts, extending anteriorly between the parietal and
temporal cortices. We compare several aspects of this continuous structure, which
we term the VOF complex (VOFâ€‰+), and neighboring fasciculi to those of macaques
and humans. We hypothesize that the essential topology of the VOF+ is a conserved
feature of the posterior cortex in anthropoid primates, with a clearer
fragmentation into multiple named fasciculi in larger, more gyrified brains.

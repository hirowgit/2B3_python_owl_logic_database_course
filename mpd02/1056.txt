Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors have been a powerful gene delivery vehicle
to the retina for basic research and gene therapy. For many of these
applications, achieving cell type-specific targeting and high transduction
efficiency is desired. Recently, there has been increasing interest in
AAV-mediated gene targeting to specific retinal bipolar cell types. A 200-bp
enhancer in combination with a basal SV40 promoter has been commonly used to
target transgenes into ON-type bipolar cells. In the current study, we searched
for additional cis-regulatory elements in the mGluR6 gene for improving
AAV-mediated transduction efficiency into retinal bipolar cells. Our results
showed that the combination of the endogenous mGluR6 promoter with additional
enhancers in the introns of the mGluR6 gene markedly enhanced AAV transduction
efficiency as well as made the targeting more selective for rod bipolar cells in 
mice. Furthermore, the AAV vectors with the improved promoter could target to ON 
bipolar cells with robust transduction efficiency in the parafovea and the far
peripheral retina of marmoset monkeys. The improved mGluR6 promoter constructs
could provide a valuable tool for genetic manipulation in rod bipolar cells in
mice and facilitate clinical applications for ON bipolar cell-based gene
therapies.

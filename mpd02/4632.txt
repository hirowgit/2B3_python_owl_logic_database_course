Haematological characteristics of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus
jacchus).

McIntosh GH, Lawson CA, Rodgers SE, Lloyd JV.

Blood cell indices and parameters of haemostasis were studied in the common
marmoset. The majority of the results were similar to those found in man.
Differences from man were that the prothrombin time was shorter in the marmoset, 
higher concentrations of aggregating stimuli were required to cause platelet
aggregation, and marmoset platelets did not aggregate under the influence of
adrenalin. There was sexual dimorphism evident in the data for fibrinogen
concentration and for platelet count, both of which were higher in females than
in males. Marmoset platelets were very similar in ultrastructure to those of man.

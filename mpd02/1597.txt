The Callitrichidae are the smallest anthropoids, whereas the Cheirogaleidae
include the smallest of all primates. Using species-level analyses, we show that 
these are derived conditions; both neonatal and adult body mass decreased in a
gradual, phyletic manner in parallel across callitrichids, and across
cheirogaleids. We identify lineages with particularly rapid decreases and
highlight the pygmy marmoset, Callithrix pygmaea, as a phenotypic outlier. The
life-history traits associated with body-mass reduction in each clade suggest
that the convergent evolution of small body size was achieved by changes in
different ontogenetic stages. Body-size reduction in callitrichids appears to be 
almost exclusively due to alterations in prenatal growth rate, whereas body-size 
reduction in cheirogaleids may have been largely due to reduced duration of
growth phases. Finally, we use these results to discuss some of the debates
surrounding the evolution of Homo floresiensis and suggest potential parallels
between the evolution of H. floresiensis and callitrichids.

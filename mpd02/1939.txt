Olfactory cues can exert priming effects on many mammalian species. Paternally
experienced marmosets, Callithrix jacchus, exposed to direct isolated olfactory
contact with their own infant's scent show rapid decreases in testosterone levels
within 20 min, whereas paternally inexperienced males do not. The following study
tests whether there is a differential steroid response to exposure of infant
scent from dependent infants (own and novel) and independent infants (own and
novel). We examined the serum levels of estradiol, estrone, testosterone,
dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and combined estrogens and androgens in eight male
marmosets 20 min after exposure to isolated infant scent. Testosterone and
androgen levels combined were significantly lower with exposure to own infant
scent than a novel infant scent when the infants were at a dependent age but not 
at an independent age. Estrogen levels elevated significantly in response to own 
infant scent when the infants were at a dependent age but not at an independent
age. These results suggest that marmoset fathers are more responsive to priming
cues from related infants and hormonal responses from fathers are greatest when
the infant is at a dependent age.

Mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase II (COII) gene sequences (549 base pairs) were
used to investigate the taxonomic relationships among 12 marmoset (Callithrix,
Cebuella and Mico) taxa. A large number of substitutions were found in the third 
base codon positions, providing a strong phylogenetic signal in a gene coding a
conserved protein. Despite the significant affinity between the 2 Amazonian
genera Cebuella and Mico, found in recent molecular studies, the analysis
presented here did not resolve convincingly the phylogenetic relationships
between the 3 genera. Mico nevertheless formed 3 distinct clades, reflecting a
basic division of species groups based on geographic distribution (east or west
of the Rio Tapajós) rather than morphology (presence or absence of auricular
hair). This supports the taxonomic distinction of the allopatric emiliae forms.
In Callithrix, Callithrix aurita forms a distinct clade, but the remaining
morphotypes form a somewhat contradictory cluster, possibly resulting from an
extremely rapid radiation.

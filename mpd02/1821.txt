BACKGROUND: Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a rare progressive
neurodegenerative encephalitis caused by some variants of measles virus (MV). The
structure of SSPE virus in the brains of SSPE patients is different from that of 
MV. The difference in interferon (IFN) production between cells infected with
SSPE virus and those infected with MV remains unclear.
METHODS: We measured the concentrations of IFN-α, β, γ, and λ1 (interleukin
(IL)-29) from MV- or SSPE virus-infected B95a cells (a marmoset B-lymphoblastoid 
cell line).
RESULTS: SSPE virus-infected B95a cells produced significantly higher levels of
IFN-α and λ1 than did MV-infected or mock-infected cells.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that SSPE virus and MV induce different IFN
production profiles.

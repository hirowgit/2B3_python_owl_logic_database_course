Macaca, Callithrix jacchus marmoset monkey, Pan troglodytes chimpanzee and human 
retinas were examined to define if short wavelength (S) cones share molecular
markers with L&M cone or rod photoreceptors. S cones showed consistent
differences in their immunohistochemical staining and expression levels compared 
to L&M cones for "rod" Arrestin1 (S-Antigen), "cone" Arrestin4, cone alpha
transducin, and Calbindin. Our data verify a similar pattern of expression in
these primate retinas and provide clues to the structural divergence of rods and 
S cones versus L&M cones, suggesting S cone retinal function is "intermediate"
between them.

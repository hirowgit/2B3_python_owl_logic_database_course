Herpesvirus saimiri (HVS) is a gamma(2)-herpesvirus sharing genomic colinearity
and a high degree of functional homology with HHV-8. To begin exploring the
correlates of HVS infectivity and neutralization, we designed and implemented a
new reporter assay. Using this assay, we could demonstrate that HVS neutralizing 
antibodies are present at high levels in naturally infected squirrel monkeys and 
are strongly induced after pathogenic, experimental infection of common
marmosets. Further, we demonstrated that viral entry is influenced by cellular
glycosaminoglycans and that, similar to HHV-8, soluble heparin is capable of
blocking infectivity. We next cloned and characterized the positional homologue
of HHV-8 K8.1, HVS Orf51. N-glycosidase F treatment indicates that like K8.1,
Orf51 is a glycoprotein. Found in the viral particle, it localizes to the
endoplasmic reticulum of expressing cells. Like K8.1, Orf51 could bind to
agarose-conjugated heparin, implicating this molecule in viral attachment to
cells. These studies provide the groundwork for additional experiments into the
role that this protein may be playing in viral pathogenicity, persistence, and
cell tropism.

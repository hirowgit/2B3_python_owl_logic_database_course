Common marmosets were treated with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine
(MPTP, 1.25-2.5 mg/kg s.c., twice a week) for 5-10 consecutive months. The
initial doses of MPTP produced a severe parkinsonian syndrome but motor activity 
was partially recovered at the end of treatment. Fifteen days or 6 months after
the last MPTP dose, monkeys were sacrificed. In addition to a strong decrease of 
dopamine in the striatum, there were significant reductions in substance P and
Met-enkephalin content in the substantia nigra, caudate nucleus and putamen. In
the globus pallidus, the reduction in peptide levels did not reach statistical
significance as compared to controls. Neurotensin levels were also decreased in
the caudate nucleus. The chronic administration of MPTP for 5-10 months induces
changes in substance P and Met-enkephalin systems which resemble the degeneration
found in brains from parkinsonian patients.

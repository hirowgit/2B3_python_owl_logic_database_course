Plasma testosterone concentrations during postnatal development in the male
common marmoset.

Dixson AF.

Repeated measurements of plasma testosterone (T) were made in 56 male marmosets
from the day of birth until 300 days of age and in 44 adults (greater than 3
years). The resulting profile of plasma T during postnatal development shows
higher levels during infancy (1-90 days) followed by a nadir between 100 and 170 
days and then a progressive rise in T during puberty. Although T levels of up to 
21 ng/ml were measured in infant males, mean levels (+/- SEM) were 5.4 +/- 0.6
ng/ml (days 1-10), declining gradually to 1.7 +/- 0.1 ng/ml (days 100-110). No
increase in mean T levels between 15 and 100 days was identified, and the onset
of puberty was earlier in some males than measured previously in this species.

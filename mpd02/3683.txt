Expression of the nuclear receptor, steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1/Ad4BP), was
studied in a primate (marmoset) ovary using immunohistochemical, RT-PCR, and
immunoblot techniques. The periovulatory phase was compared with the luteal
phase. With PCR we found a marmoset homolog of SF-1/Ad4BP to be expressed in
ovarian and other steroidogenic tissues. Characteristically, the periovulatory
ovaries consisted of growing (non-luteinized) small follicles together with large
luteinizing follicles and many corpora lutea accessoria (Clas), which had
developed from atretic large follicles. During the luteal phase, true corpora
lutea (Cls) were additionally found. In general, we found that small follicles
were devoid of any immunoreactivity of SF-1/Ad4BP. In large follicles, the
luteinizing theca and granulosa cells express SF-1/Ad4BP. All luteal cells of
Clas showed a nuclear staining in both ovary types. In Cls, only a few luteal
cells were positive. Large follicles of different sizes showed no differences in 
expression level, as evidenced by immunoblot analysis. Our results indicate that 
SF-1/ Ad4BP participates in the activation of genc transcription during the onset
of luteinization and that Clas are essential for ovarian luteal function.

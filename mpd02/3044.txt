Sex determination in mammals is dependent on the presence of SRY, which codes for
a protein with a DNA binding motif (the HMG-box domain). Here we analyze the
evolution of SRY among seven genera of New World monkeys belonging to the family 
Cebidae. Estimates of the number of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions
indicated the absence of positive selection acting on SRY evolution. The presence
of indels at the C-terminus coding region in different genera and species
maintained an open reading frame, indicating a selective pressure constraining
the evolution of this coding region. Available data on the fertility of natural
and captive interspecific hybrids failed to show any relationship between SRY
evolution and speciation for the genera herein studied. Our phylogenetic
arrangement for Cebidae genera was similar to previous topologies based on
mitochondrial and autosomal DNA sequences. This arrangement also corroborated the
division of Cebus into two species groups. However, for Callithrix the
differences among SRY topology and those derived from autosomal and mitochondrial
genes suggested a Y-chromosome ancestral polymorphism.

Many live, attenuated viral vaccines are derived from wild type viruses with
known neurovirulent properties. To assure the absence of residual neurotoxicity, 
pre-clinical neurovirulence safety testing of candidate vaccines is performed.
For mumps virus, a highly neurotropic virus, neurovirulence safety testing is
performed in monkeys. However, laboratory studies suggest an inability of this
test to correctly discern among virus strains of varying neurovirulence potential
in man, and, further, some vaccines found to be neuroattenuated in monkeys were
later found to be neurovirulent in humans when administered in large numbers.
Over the past decade, concerted efforts have been made to replace monkey-based
neurovirulence safety testing with more informative, alternative methods. This
review summarizes the current status of mumps vaccine neurovirulence safety
testing and insights into models currently approved and those under development.

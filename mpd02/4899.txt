The reproductive potential of the common cotton-eared marmoset (Callithrix
jacchus) in captivity.

Phillips IR.

The breeding records of a closed colony of marmosets maintained for five years
are described. Three generations have been born and a high incidence of
multiparity has been achieved. The reproductive potential of C. jacchus is higher
than that of virtually any other primate maintained in captivity.

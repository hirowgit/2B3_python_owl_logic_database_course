Effects of Monocular Atropinization on Refractive Error and Eye Growth in Infant 
New World Monkeys.

Whatham AR, Lunn D, Judge SJ.

Purpose: To explore the effect of topical atropine on axial eye growth and
emmetropization in infant marmosets.
Methods: Atropine was applied to one eye from the age of 7 to 56 days in two dose
regimens, High (0.1-1% twice daily, increasing with age) or moderate (Mod) (0.1% 
once daily). Both eyes of the marmosets were refracted, and axial dimensions were
measured ultrasonically, at 14, 28, 42, 49, 56, 70, 105, 168, and 279 days of
age. The time course of each measured variable was analyzed using multilevel
mixed-effects modeling realized in R.
Results: The logistic growth curves fitted to anterior segment depth (ASD) did
not differ significantly between the dose regimens, but xmid, the age at which
growth was half-maximal, and scal, the time constant of the exponential term in
the logistic growth curve equation, differed significantly between the ASD of
atropinized and untreated eyes (P = 0.03 and P < 0.0001, respectively), with the 
ASD of atropinized eyes shorter than that of untreated eyes. The splines fitted
to lens thickness did not vary significantly with dose, but differed
significantly (P < 0.0001) between the atropinized and untreated eyes, with the
atropinized lenses thicker. Vitreous chamber depth (VCD) was not significantly
different, but the variance of VCD was significantly greater (P < 0.001) in the
atropinized compared with the untreated eyes. Refractive error (RE) became
relatively myopic in atropinized eyes. The variance of RE in atropinized eyes was
significantly greater (P < 0.0001) than in untreated eyes.
Conclusions: Atropine caused the infant marmoset lens to move forward and
thicken, a relative myopia, and increases in the between-animals variance in VCD,
which could be considered a failure of emmetropization.

Serotonin (5-HT) is involved in the fine adjustments at several brain centers
including the core of the mammal circadian timing system (CTS) and the
hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). The SCN receives massive serotonergic
projections from the midbrain raphe nuclei, whose inputs are described in rats as
ramifying at its ventral portion overlapping the retinohypothalamic and
geniculohypothalamic fibers. In the SCN, the 5-HT actions are reported as being
primarily mediated by the 5-HT1 type receptor with noted emphasis for 5-HT(1B)
subtype, supposedly modulating the retinal input in a presynaptic way. In this
study in a New World primate species, the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus),
we showed the 5-HT(1B) receptor distribution at the dorsal SCN concurrent with a 
distinctive location of 5-HT-immunoreactive fibers. This finding addresses to a
new discussion on the regulation and synchronization of the circadian rhythms in 
recent primates.

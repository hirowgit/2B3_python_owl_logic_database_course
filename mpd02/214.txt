The rapid adoption of marmosets in neuroscience has created a demand for three
dimensional (3D) atlases of the brain of this species to facilitate data
integration in a common reference space. We report on a new open access template 
of the marmoset cortex (the Nencki-Monash, or NM template), representing a
morphological average of 20 brains of young adult individuals, obtained by 3D
reconstructions generated from Nissl-stained serial sections. The method used to 
generate the template takes into account morphological features of the individual
brains, as well as the borders of clearly defined cytoarchitectural areas. This
has resulted in a resource which allows direct estimates of the most likely
coordinates of each cortical area, as well as quantification of the margins
of error involved in assigning voxels to areas, and preserves quantitative
information about the laminar structure of the cortex. We provide spatial
transformations between the NM and other available marmoset brain templates, thus
enabling integration with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and tracer-based
connectivity data. The NM template combines some of the main advantages of
histology-based atlases (e.g. information about the cytoarchitectural structure) 
with features more commonly associated with MRI-based templates (isotropic nature
of the dataset, and probabilistic analyses). The underlying workflow may be found
useful in the future development of 3D brain atlases that incorporate information
about the variability of areas in species for which it may be impractical to
ensure homogeneity of the sample in terms of age, sex and genetic background.

The selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, onansetron, has been assessed in three
tests of cognition in the mouse, rat and marmoset. In a habituation test in the
mouse, ondansetron facilitated performance in young adult and aged animals, and
inhibited an impairment in habituation induced by scopolamine, electrolesions or 
ibotenic acid lesions of the nucleus basalis magnocellularis. Arecoline failed to
improve basal performance in young adult mice but inhibited the impairment caused
by scopolamine and lesions of the nucleus basalis magnocellularis. In the T-maze 
reinforced alternation task in rats, ondansetron and arecoline antagonised a
scopolamine-induced impairment. In an object discrimination and reversal learning
task in the marmoset, assessed using a Wisconsin General Test Apparatus,
ondansetron improved performance in a reversal learning task. We conclude that
ondansetron potently improves basal performance in rodent and primate tests of
cognition and inhibits the impairments in performance caused by cholinergic
deficits.

The ability to measure and interpret variables associated with feeding behavior
and food intake is essential to a variety of nonhuman primate study modalities.
The development of a technique to accurately and efficiently measure food intake 
and meal patterning in captivity will enhance both the interpretation of foraging
behavior in the wild as well as our ability to model clinically relevant human
feeding pathologies. In this study, we successfully developed the use of a rodent
lickometer system to monitor meal patterning in captive common marmosets. We
describe the modifications necessary for this type of instrumentation to be used 
successfully with marmosets. We define variables of interest that relate to both 
previous rodent literature and human clinical measures. Finally, we relate our
findings to potential translational value for both primate field research and
biomedical applications.

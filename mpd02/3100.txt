Cells in the intra-articular disc of the temporomandibular joint of the rat,
guinea pig, rabbit, ferret, marmoset and sheep were studied at the
ultrastructural level. The cells were generally rounded in outline and possessed 
moderate amounts of roughened endoplasmic reticulum and other organelles
associated with protein synthesis and secretion. No intracellular collagen
profiles were observed. Many of the cells possessed conspicuous amounts of
microfilamentous material. Cell membranes in the rat, guinea pig, rabbit, ferret 
and sheep were closely applied to the collagen fibrils of the extracellular
matrix. Occasionally in these animals, a narrow, irregular space containing
microfilamentous material surrounded the cell membrane. Many cells in the
marmoset differed from this description in being completely surrounded by an
obvious pericellular matrix devoid of collagen fibrils and being comprised of
microfilamentous material embedded in an amorphous ground substance. These
chondrocyte-like cells in the intra-articular disc of the marmoset differed from 
chondrocytes in hyaline cartilage by lacking a pericellular capsule.

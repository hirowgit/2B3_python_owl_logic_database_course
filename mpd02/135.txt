Age-related cognitive decline has been extensively studied in humans, but the
majority of research designs are cross-sectional and compare across younger and
older adults. Longitudinal studies are necessary to capture variability in
cognitive aging trajectories but are difficult to carry out in humans and
long-lived nonhuman primates. Marmosets are an ideal primate model for
neurocognitive aging as their naturally short lifespan facilitates longitudinal
designs. In a longitudinal study of marmosets tested on reversal learning
starting in middle-age, we found that, on average, the group of marmosets
declined in cognitive performance around 8 years of age. However, we found highly
variable patterns of cognitive aging trajectories across individuals. Preliminary
analyses of brain tissues from this cohort also show highly variable degrees of
neuropathology. Future work will tie together behavioral trajectories with brain 
pathology and provide a window into the factors that predict age-related
cognitive decline.

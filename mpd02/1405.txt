BACKGROUND: The impact of the intrauterine environment on the developmental
programming of adult female reproductive success is still poorly understood and
potentially underestimated. Litter size variation in a nonhuman primate, the
common marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus), allows us to model the effects of
varying intrauterine environments (e.g. nutrient restriction, exposure to male
womb-mates) on the risk of losing fetuses in adulthood. Our previous work has
characterized the fetuses of triplet pregnancies as experiencing intrauterine
nutritional restriction.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used over a decade of demographic data from
the Southwest National Primate Research Center common marmoset colony. We
evaluated differences between twin and triplet females in the number of
pregnancies they produce and the proportion of those pregnancies that ended in
fetal loss. We found that triplet females produced the same number of total
offspring as twin females, but lost offspring during pregnancy at a significantly
higher rate than did twins (38% vs. 13%, p = 0.02). Regardless of their own birth
weight or the sex ratio of the litter the experienced as fetuses, triplet females
lost more fetuses than did twins. Females with a male littermate experienced a
significant increase in the proportion of stillbirths.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These striking findings anchor pregnancy loss in the
mother's own fetal environment and development, underscoring a "Womb to Womb"
view of the lifecourse and the intergenerational consequences of development.
This has important translational implications for understanding the large
proportion of human stillbirths that are unexplained. Our findings provide strong
evidence that a full understanding of mammalian life history and reproductive
biology requires a developmental foundation.

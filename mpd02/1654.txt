BACKGROUND: The wearing-OFF phenomenon is a common motor complication of chronic 
L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) therapy for Parkinson's disease. We
recently described the discovery of UWA-101, a dual serotonin (SERT) and dopamine
(DAT) transporter inhibitor, which increases the duration of "good quality"
ON-time provided by L-DOPA in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine
(MPTP)-lesioned primate. Here, we further characterise the effects of UWA-101 on 
this extension of ON-time in terms of L-DOPA-induced side-effects in the
MPTP-lesioned common marmoset.
METHODS: Marmosets were rendered parkinsonian by MPTP injection and "primed" by
repeated L-DOPA administration, to exhibit dyskinesia and psychosis-like
behaviours. Animals were then administered acute challenges of L-DOPA in
combination with UWA-101 (1, 3, 6 and 10 mg/kg) or vehicle.
RESULTS: In combination with L-DOPA, UWA-101 (3, 6 and 10 mg/kg) significantly
increased duration of ON-time (by 28%, 28%, and 33%, respectively; all P<0.05).
UWA-101 (10 mg/kg) significantly extended duration of ON-time without disabling
dyskinesia (by 62%, P<0.01). UWA-101 did not exacerbate the severity of
dyskinesia (P>0.05). However, at the highest doses (6 and 10 mg/kg), UWA-101
increased the severity of psychosis-like behaviours (P<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that dual SERT/ DAT inhibitors can
effectively enhance L-DOPA anti-parkinsonian action, without exacerbating
dyskinesia and, as such, represent a promising new therapeutic class for
wearing-OFF. However, at higher doses, dual SERT/ DAT inhibitors may exacerbate
dopaminergic psychosis.

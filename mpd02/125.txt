Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-based episomal vector system enables persistent
transgene expression, which is advantageous for efficient derivation of
transgene-free induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) without viral transduction.
Here, we report establishment of an iPSC line from somatic fibroblasts of a
neonatal common marmoset monkey (marmoset; Callithrix jacchus) using an
all-in-one episomal vector that we newly developed. The established iPSC line,
named NM-iPS, showed standard characteristics of pluripotency such as
pluripotency-related marker expression, three germ layer differentiation, and
normal karyotype (2n = 46). The novel iPSC line would be a useful resource for
stem cell research using non-human primates.

Vocal communication in animals often involves taking turns vocalizing. In humans,
turn-taking is a fundamental rule in conversation. Among non-human primates, the 
common marmoset is known to engage in antiphonal calling using phee calls and
trill calls. Calls of the trill type are the most common, yet difficult to study,
because they are not very loud and uttered in conditions when animals are in
close proximity to one another. Here we recorded trill calls in captive
pair-housed marmosets using wearable microphones, while the animals were together
with their partner or separated, but within trill call range. Trills were
exchanged mainly with the partner and not with other animals in the room. Animals
placed outside the home cage increased their trill call rate and uttered more
trills in response to their partner compared to strangers. The fundamental
frequency, F0, of trills increased when animals were placed outside the cage. Our
results indicate that trill calls can be monitored using wearable audio equipment
and that minor changes in social context affect trill call interactions and
spectral properties of trill calls.

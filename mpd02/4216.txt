Monkeys with bilateral transection of the fornix were severely but selectively
impaired on learning and retention of visuospatial conditional discriminations,
visual conditional discriminations and non-conditional spatial-response tasks.
Bilateral transplantation of cholinergic-rich fetal basal forebrain tissue into
the hippocampus abolished significant learning impairments on all those tasks
impaired by fornix lesions when tested three to nine months after transplantation
whereas bilateral transplants of non-cholinergic fetal hippocampal tissue into
hippocampus showed no such beneficial effect. Acetylcholinesterase staining was
severely depleted throughout the dentate gyrus and hippocampus in
fornix-transected monkeys compared with animals with control corpus callosum
ablations. Staining was largely restored to normal in the host hippocampus and
dentate gyrus in monkeys with cholinergic transplants, whereas
acetylcholinesterase staining was abnormal in those with non-cholinergic grafts. 
These experiments suggest that where a "higher order" cognitive function, in this
case the acquisition of specific types of information into long-term memory, is
disturbed by a neuropharmacologically simple lesion, cognitive function can be
restored by transplantation of neurons containing appropriate neurotransmitters.

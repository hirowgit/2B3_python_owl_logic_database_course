BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Overweight and obesity are undoubtable risk factors for
type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases and significantly contribute to the
global morbi-mortality. We previoulsy reported that LNP599, a pharmacological
imidazoline-like activator of hepatic AMPK/adiponectin signaling, protects
against the development of adiposity and obesity and the associated
cardio-metabolic disorders, suggesting that it may be a suitable drug candidate
for a therapeutic approach targeting the development of obesity at very early
stages. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the metabolic effects 
of LNP599 in a model of diet-induced overweight and metabolic disorders in a
nonhuman primate, the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), and more particularly
to establish the impact of the compound on cholesterol homeostasis, i.e., HDL and
LDL/VLDL lipoproteins.
METHODS: Marmosets were fed normal (NC) or hypercaloric (HC) chow during 16
weeks. Diet-induced changes in body weight and metabolism were assessed. Effects 
of LNP599 were evaluated in a subset of HC animals (HC-LNP) receiving the
compound at a daily dose of 10 mg/kg over the 16 weeks.
RESULTS: HC-feeding induced significant overweight associated with a marked
dyslipidemia (hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, and reduced HDL over
LDL/VLDL cholesterol ratio). LNP599 blunted the diet-induced body weight gain and
largely protected against the development of hypertriglyceridemia. Total
cholesterol was unchanged but the ratio of HDL over LDL/VLDL cholesterol was more
than doubled.
CONCLUSIONS: The profile of metabolic troubles obtained upon enriched diet
mimicked the disorders associated with spontaneous obesity in marmosets. HC
marmosets represent an experimental model of high clinical relevance to study the
pathophysiology of obesity and related dyslipidemia and to evaluate the effects
of emerging therapies targeting these disorders. Our data confirm the preventing 
effects of LNP599 in a nonhuman primate model and demonstrate for the first time 
the high potency of this drug in promoting HDL-cholesterol.

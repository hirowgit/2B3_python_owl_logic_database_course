Experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) is an autoimmune disease of the
central nervous system that serves as a model for the human disease multiple
sclerosis. We evaluated rolipram, a type IV phosphodiesterase inhibitor, for its 
efficacy in preventing EAE in the common marmoset Callithrix jacchus. In a
blinded experimental design, clinical signs of EAE developed within 17 days of
immunization with human white matter in two placebo-treated animals but in none
of three monkeys that received rolipram (10 mg/kg s.c. every other day) beginning
1 week after immunization. In controls, signs of EAE were associated with
development of cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis and cerebral MRI abnormalities. In
the treatment group, there was sustained protection from clinical EAE, transient 
cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis in only one of three animals, no MRI abnormality,
and marked reduction in histopathologic findings. Rolipram-treated and control
animals equally developed circulating antibodies to myelin basic protein. Thus,
inhibition of type IV phosphodiesterase, initiated after sensitization to central
nervous system antigens, protected against autoimmune demyelinating disease.

The teratogenic potencies of the enantiomers of
2-(2,6-dioxopiperidine-3-yl)-phthalimidine ( = EM 12), a teratogenic thalidomide 
analogue, were investigated in Callithrix jacchus, a primate very sensitive to
the teratogenic action of this thalidomide analogue. The results indicate that
the S-(-)-form of EM 12 is clearly more teratogenic than the R-(+)-form. The
interpretation of the studies designed to evaluate stereo-selective differences
in the teratogenicity of the enantiomers becomes difficult, since both
enantiomers racemise in vivo with appreciable rates (Schmahl et al. 1988a, b).
Therefore, it cannot be concluded as yet that the R-(+)-form lacks all
teratogenic potential.

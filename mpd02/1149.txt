Common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) monkeys are a resource for biomedical
research and their use is predicted to increase due to the suitability of this
species for transgenic approaches. Identification of abnormal neurodevelopment
due to genetic modification relies upon the comparison with validated patterns of
normal behavior defined by unbiased methods. As scientists unfamiliar with
nonhuman primate development are interested to apply genomic editing techniques
in marmosets, it would be beneficial to the field that the investigators use
validated methods of postnatal evaluation that are age and species appropriate.
This review aims to analyze current available data on marmoset physical and
behavioral postnatal development, describe the methods used and discuss next
steps to better understand and evaluate marmoset normal and abnormal postnatal
neurodevelopment.

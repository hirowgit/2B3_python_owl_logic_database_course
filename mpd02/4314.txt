Chronic protein deficiency (8 weeks) was examined in marmosets (Callithrix
jacchus) and sub-acute (1 week) methionine- and choline-deprivation was
investigated in F344 rats. The marmosets were considered to have become
protein-deficient but there was no alteration in sperm morphology, either at the 
end of the diet or 5 weeks later. Weight loss was also observed in rats on the
methionine- and choline-free diet and they had significantly decreased sperm
counts 4 weeks after the end of treatment. However, there was no effect on sperm 
morphology, or on the proportion of cytosine residues that were methylated in the
sperm DNA.

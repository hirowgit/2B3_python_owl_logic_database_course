The effect of haemolysis on some clinical chemistry parameters in the marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus).

Davy CW, Jackson MR, Walker JM.

The effect of haemolysis on the levels of commonly analysed plasma constituents
was investigated in the common marmoset. Results were divided into a) low levels 
of extra haemolysis (less than 2 g/l plasma haemoglobin) and b) high levels of
extra haemolysis (greater than 2 g/l plasma haemoglobin). Mean changes in plasma 
constituent levels were examined and the correlation with increased haemolysis
measured. Large changes in malate dehydrogenase and lactate dehydrogenase were
found at low levels of haemolysis. With higher levels of haemolysis there were
statistically significant changes in the levels of alanine aminotransferase,
isocitrate dehydrogenase, glutathione reductase, bilirubin, aspartate
aminotransferase and sorbitol dehydrogenase. The significance of these findings
is considered in relation to the interpretation of changes of plasma constituents
as indicators of tissue/organ damage.

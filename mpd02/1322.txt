White matter (WM) impairment and motor deficit after stroke are directly related.
However, WM injury mechanisms and their relation to motor disturbances are still 
poorly understood. In humans, the anterior choroidal artery (AChA) irrigates the 
internal capsule (IC), and stroke to this region can induce isolated motor
impairment. The goal of this study was to analyze whether AChA occlusion can
injure the IC in the marmoset monkey. The vascular distribution of the marmoset
brain was examined by colored latex perfusion and revealed high resemblance to
the human brain anatomy. Next, a new approach to electrocoagulate the AChA was
developed and chronic experiments showed infarction compromising the IC on
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning (day 4) and histology (day 11).
Behavioral analysis was performed using a neurologic score previously developed
and our own scoring method. Marmosets showed a decreased score that was still
evident at day 10 after AChA electrocoagulation. We developed a new approach able
to induce damage to the marmoset IC that may be useful for the detailed study of 
WM impairment and behavioral changes after stroke in the nonhuman primate.

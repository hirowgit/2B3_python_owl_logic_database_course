Despite drug advances for Hepatitis C virus (HCV), re-infections remain prevalent
in high-risk populations. Unfortunately, the role of preexisting viral immunity
and how it modulates re-infection is unclear. GBV-B infection of common marmosets
is a useful model to study tissue immune responses in hepacivirus infections, and
in this study we re-challenged 4 animals after clearance of primary viremia.
Although only low-to-absent viremia was observed following re-challenge, GBV-B
viral RNA was detectable in liver, confirming re-infection. Microscopic hepatic
lesions indicated severe-to-mild lymphocyte infiltration and fibrosis in 3 out of
4 animals. Further, GBV-B-specific T cells were elevated in animals with
moderate-to-severe hepatopathology, and up to 3-fold increases in myeloid
dendritic and activated natural killer cells were observed after infection. Our
data indicate that occult hepacivirus re-infections occur and that new liver
pathology is possible even in the presence of anti-hepacivirus T cells and in the
absence of high viremia.

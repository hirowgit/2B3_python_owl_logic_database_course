This article describes a laboratory system for running learning experiments in
operant chambers with various species. It is based on a modern version of a
classical learning chamber for operant conditioning, the so-called "Skinner box".
Rather than constituting a stand-alone unit, as is usually the case, it is an
integrated part of a comprehensive technical solution, thereby eliminating a
number of practical problems that are frequently encountered in research on
animal learning and behavior. The Vienna comparative cognition technology
combines modern computer, stimulus presentation, and reinforcement technology
with flexibility and user-friendliness, which allows for efficient, widely
automatized across-species experimentation, and thus makes the system appropriate
for use in a broad range of learning tasks.

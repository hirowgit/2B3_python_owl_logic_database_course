Serum protein electrophoretic patterns of the marmoset, Callithrix jacchus.

Allchin JP, Evans GO.

Three electrophoretic procedures were used to separate protein fractions of
marmoset serum. The albumin of marmoset serum migrated further than that of human
serum with all three procedures and the number and size of the globulin fractions
differed with species and with procedure.

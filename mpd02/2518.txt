The function of the central nervous system neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT)
contributes to individual differences in impulsive behavior in humans and
nonhuman primates. We investigated the relationship between 5-HT function and
behavioral responses to a novel social scenario in marmosets. In the first study,
marmosets (n=10) were treated orally with fluoxetine HCl (FLX) or vehicle for two
trial periods and exposed to a novel conspecific for a 20-min trial following
each treatment. Levels of behavioral inhibition in response to a novel
conspecific were quantified. The animals exhibited less inhibition toward the
novel conspecific following the 14-day FLX treatment than they did following the 
vehicle treatment. In the second study we first characterized the parameters of
the marmoset peripheral 5-HT system and further assessed the relationship between
natural variation in peripheral 5-HT and 5-HIAA levels with behavioral inhibition
in response to a novel conspecific (n=14). Individual peripheral 5-HT and 5-HIAA 
levels were higher in animals that exhibited more inhibition in response toward
the stranger. We conclude that serotonergic influences play a role in behavioral 
response to a novel conspecific in marmosets.

Vocal communication is a sensory-motor process requiring auditory self-monitoring
to correct errors and to ensure accurate vocal production. When presented with
altered speech feedback, humans rapidly change their speech to compensate.
Although previous evidence has demonstrated suppression of auditory cortex during
both speech and animal vocalization, the specific role of auditory cortex in such
feedback-dependent control is unknown. Here we show the relationship between
neural activity in the auditory cortex and feedback-dependent vocal control in
marmoset monkeys. We demonstrate that marmosets, like humans, exhibit feedback
control of vocal acoustics. We further show that feedback-sensitive activity of
auditory cortex neurons predict such compensatory vocal changes. Finally, we
demonstrate that electrical microstimulation of auditory cortex rapidly evokes
similar changes in vocal production. These results are evidence for a causal role
of auditory cortex in vocal self-monitoring and feedback-dependent control, and
have implications for understanding human speech motor control.

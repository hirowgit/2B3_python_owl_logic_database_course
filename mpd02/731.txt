Hybrid palm oil, which contains higher levels of oleic acid and lower saturated
fatty acids in comparison with African palm oil, has been proposed to be somehow 
equivalent to extra virgin olive oil. However, the biological effects of its
consumption are poorly described. Here we have explored the effects of its
overconsumption on lipid metabolism in a non-human primate model, the common
marmoset. Dietary supplementation of marmoset with hyperlipidic diet containing
hybrid palm oil for 3 months did not modify plasma lipids levels, but increased
glucose levels as compared to the supplementation with African palm oil. Liver
volume was unexpectedly found to be more increased in marmosets consuming hybrid 
palm oil than in those consuming African palm oil. Hepatic total lipid content
and circulating transaminases were dramatically increased in animals consuming
hybrid palm oil, as well as an increased degree of fibrosis. Analysis of liver
miRNAs showed a selective modulation of certain miRNAs by hybrid palm oil, some
of which were predicted to target genes involved in cell adhesion molecules and
peroxisomal pathways. Our data suggest that consumption of hybrid palm oil should
be monitored carefully, as its overconsumption compared to that of African palm
oil could involve important alterations to hepatic metabolism.

While distal influences acting both tropically and trophically upon regenerating 
nerve fibres are not in doubt, the specificity of such influences is unresolved. 
The present experiments were designed to test whether pioneering axons
regenerating through a large muscle graft showed specificity for their homonymous
distal stumps if faced with a choice of pathways. Regeneration was assessed with 
respect to nerve conduction, the electromyograph, isometric tension and
morphological indices of nerve regeneration in the median and ulnar nerves of
non-human primates. Reinnervation of both distal stumps with functional
neuromuscular transmission was found to take place by growth of nerve fibres from
either proximal nerve into either distal stump. There was thus no evidence of
specific homonymous reinnervation. The implications of this finding are discussed
from a mechanistic and a clinical point of view.

Fifty common marmoset pregnancies were monitored using ultrasound. The objective 
was to ascertain if fetal mortality was related to litter size. Prior to analysis
we determined abortion rate and litter size were not influenced by repeated
ultrasound. Mortality was unrelated to litter size and occurred fairly late in
gestation. All singletons born in this study began gestation as twins. It is
hypothesized that marmosets may be able to adjust litter size late in pregnancy
in response to proximate environmental factors.

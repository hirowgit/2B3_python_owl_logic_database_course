The administration of estradiol-17β (E) to animal models after loss of ovarian
steroid production has many beneficial effects on neural functions, particularly 
in the serotonin system in nonhuman primates (NHPs). E also has anorexic effects,
although the mechanism of action is not well defined. In the US, obesity has
reached epidemic proportions, and blame is partially directed at the Western
style diet, which is high in fat and sugar. This study examined the interaction
of E and diet in surgically menopausal nonhuman primates with a 2×2 block design.
Marmosets (Callithrix jacchus; n=4/group) were placed on control-low fat diet
(LFD; 14%kcal from fat) or high fat diet (HFD; 28%kcal from fat) 1month prior to 
ovariectomy (Ovx). Empty (placebo) or E-filled Silastic capsules were implanted
immediately following Ovx surgery. Treatments extended 6months. The established
groups were: placebo+LFD, E+LFD, placebo+HFD, or E+HFD. At necropsy, the brain
was flushed with saline and harvested. The midbrain was dissected and a small
block containing the dorsal raphe nucleus was processed for qRT-PCR using
Evagreen (Biotinum). Genes previously found to impact serotonin neural functions 
were examined. Results were compared with 2-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni
post-hoc tests or Cohen's D analysis. There was a significant effect of treatment
on tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2) across the groups (p=0.019). E stimulated TPH2
expression and HFD prevented E-stimulated TPH2 expression (p<0.01). Treatment
differentially affected monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) across the groups (p=0.05). E
increased MAO-B with LFD, and this stimulatory effect was prevented by HFD
(p<0.05). There was a significant difference between treatments in corticotrophin
releasing factor-receptor 2 (CRF-R2) expression (p=0.012). E increased CRF-R2 and
this stimulatory effect was blocked by HFD (p<0.01). Regardless of diet, E
increased Fev mRNA (p=0.028) and decreased CRF-receptor 1 (CRF-R1) mRNA (p=0.04).
HFD suppressed urocortin 1 (UCN1; stresscopin) expression (p=0.045) but E
treatment had no effect. Monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) was different due to
treatment across the groups (p=0.028). MAO-A was increased in the E+HFD group
(p<0.01) whereas previous studies showed E suppressed MAO-A in macaques. The
serotonin reuptake transporter (SERT), the serotonin 1A receptor (5HT1A),
estrogen receptor beta (ERβ) and progestin receptor (PR) expressions were not
different between groups. Estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) was undetectable. In
summary, the data indicate that important actions of hormone therapy in the
serotonin system may be lost in the context of a HFD.

Distribution of ciliated epithelial cells in the trachea of common marmosets
(Callithrix jacchus).

Hoffmann R, Braun A, Knauf S, Kaup FJ, Bleyer M.

BACKGROUND: The distribution of ciliated cells in the tracheal epithelium of
common marmosets was evaluated.
METHODS: Light and scanning electron microscopy of tracheal epithelium was
performed.
RESULTS: Ciliated cells were concentrated in cartilage-free areas and virtually
absent in cartilage-supported epithelial regions.
CONCLUSIONS: Heterogeneous distribution of ciliated cells in the trachea has to
be considered when using animal models for translational respiratory research
approaches.

Despite the biological importance of UV vision, its molecular bases are not well 
understood. Here, we present evidence that UV vision in vertebrates is determined
by eight specific amino acids in the UV pigments. Amino acid sequence analyses
show that contemporary UV pigments inherited their UV sensitivities from the
vertebrate ancestor by retaining most of these eight amino acids. In the avian
lineage, the ancestral pigment lost UV sensitivity, but some descendants regained
it by one amino acid change. Our results also strongly support the hypothesis
that UV pigments have an unprotonated Schiff base-linked chromophore.

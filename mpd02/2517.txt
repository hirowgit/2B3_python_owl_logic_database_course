Alloreactive T cells play a key role in mediating graft-vs-host disease and
allograft rejection, and recent data suggest that most T cell alloreactivity
resides within the CD4 T cell subset. Particularly, T cell responses to
herpesvirus can shape the alloreactive repertoire and influence transplantation
outcomes. In this study, we describe six distinct EBV-specific CD4(+) T cell
clones that cross-reacted with EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs), 
dendritic cells, and endothelial cells expressing MHC class II alleles commonly
found in the population. Allorecognition showed exquisite MHC specificity. These 
CD4(+) T cell clones efficiently killed dendritic cells or LCLs expressing the
cross-reactive allogeneic MHC class II molecules, whereas they did not kill
autologous LCLs. Endothelial cells expressing the proper allogeneic MHC molecules
were poorly killed, but they induced high-level TNF-alpha production by the
EBV-specific CD4(+) T cell clones. As already proposed, the strong alloreactivity
toward LCLs suggest that these cells could be used for selective depletion of
alloreactive T cells.

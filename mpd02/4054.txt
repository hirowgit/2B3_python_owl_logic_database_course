The teratogenic potency of the thalidomide (Thd) derivative
phthalimidophthalimide (Phtpht) was assessed in the common marmoset (Callithrix
jacchus), by oral administration of the relatively high daily dose of 50 mg
Phtpht/kg body wt, during the susceptible period (days 48-61 of pregnancy). Since
in this species daily doses of only 100 micrograms/kg body wt of the Thd
derivative EM12 already induce typical gross structural abnormalities in nearly
100% of the fetuses, investigations with a small number of these New World
monkeys allow a rough estimation of the teratogenic potency of Thd-type
substances. Macroscopic inspection and skeletal evaluation of ten fetuses gave no
indication of dysmorphogenesis following treatment with Phtpht. We conclude that 
Phtpht has little, if any, Thd-type teratogenic potency in this non-human
primate.

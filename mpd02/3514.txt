In singular cooperatively breeding mammals, social status is a key determinant of
female reproductive success. Usually only one dominant female breeds in a social 
group. In the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a cooperatively breeding
primate, adaptations to nonbreeding subordinate status appear to parallel those
found in social insect societies which demonstrate similar skew to the marmoset
in female reproductive success. Female marmosets exhibit rank-related polyethism 
in behavior, reproductive neuroendocrinology and non-reproductive physiology, and
subordinates participate in alloparental care and territory defense. Olfactory,
visual and behavioral cues from dominant female marmosets provide important
proximate cues regulating ovarian inhibition in female subordinates.
Cooperatively breeding marmosets, therefore, appear to have developed specific
neural and neuroendocrine adaptations to subordinate social status analogous to
those found in social insects such as the lower wasps, bees and termites. Such
parallel developments probably reflect the outcome of repeated convergent
evolutionary attempts at adapting to environmental conditions not readily
conducive to dispersal and independent breeding.

We present a new 3D digital brain atlas of the non-human primate, common marmoset
monkey (Callithrix jacchus), with MRI and coregistered Nissl histology data. To
the best of our knowledge this is the first comprehensive digital 3D brain atlas 
of the common marmoset having normalized multi-modal data, cortical and
sub-cortical segmentation, and in a common file format (NIfTI). The atlas can be 
registered to new data, is useful for connectomics, functional studies,
simulation and as a reference. The atlas was based on previously published work
but we provide several critical improvements to make this release valuable for
researchers. Nissl histology images were processed to remove illumination and
shape artifacts and then normalized to the MRI data. Brain region segmentation is
provided for both hemispheres. The data is in the NIfTI format making it easy to 
integrate into neuroscience pipelines, whereas the previous atlas was in an
inaccessible file format. We also provide cortical, mid-cortical and white matter
boundary segmentations useful for visualization and analysis.

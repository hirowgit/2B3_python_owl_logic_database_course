Easy to recognize but not easy to define, animal play is a baffling behavior
because it has no obvious immediate benefits for the performers. However, the
absence of immediate advantages, if true, would leave adult play (costly but
maintained by evolution, spanning lemurs to Homo sapiens) unexplained. Although a
commonly held view maintains that play is limited by stress, an emergent
hypothesis states that play can regulate stress in the short term. Here we
explored this hypothesis in a captive family group of New World monkeys,
Callithrix jacchus (common marmoset). We observed six subjects and gathered data 
on aggressive, play, and scratching behavior via focal (6 h/individual) and all
occurrences sampling (115 h). We found that play levels were highest during
pre-feeding, the period of maximum anxiety due to the forthcoming competition
over food. Scratching (the most reliable indicator of stress in primates) and
play showed opposite trends along hierarchy, with dominants scratching more and
playing less than subordinates. Finally, scratching decreased after play, whereas
play appeared to be unrelated to previous scratching events, symptoms of a
potential stressful state. In conclusion, both play timing and hierarchical
distribution indicate that play limits stress, more than vice versa, at least in 
the short term.

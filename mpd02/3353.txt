The central nervous system is a demonstrated target of both clinical and
experimental immune mediated disorders. Immune regulatory mechanisms operative at
the levels of the systemic immune system, the blood brain barrier, and within the
CNS parenchyma are important determinants of the intensity and duration of the
tissue directed injury. Convergence of research, involving direct manipulation of
specific cells and molecular mediators in animal models and in vitro analysis of 
human immune and neural cells and tissues, is providing increasing insight into
the role of these immune regulatory functions and their potential to serve as
therapeutic targets.

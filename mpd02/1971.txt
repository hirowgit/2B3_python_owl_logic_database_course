Common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) show either a left- or right-hand
preference for reaching to pick up food and they retain the same preference
throughout adult life. We compared the behavior of 10 right-handed and 10
left-handed marmosets, matched for age and sex. They were presented with live
crickets both when alone and when in their social group. The marmosets captured
more crickets and the latency to capture the first cricket was shorter when they 
were in a group than when they were alone. This effect of social facilitation was
significantly greater for right- than left-handed individuals. The number of
vocalizations (tsik, crackle, very brief whistle, cough, and phee) produced by
the left- and right-handed marmosets differed significantly: right-handed
marmosets produced an increased number of all of these calls when the crickets
were presented, whereas left-handed marmosets did not show a change from
pretesting levels. The right-handed marmosets also produced more tsik (mobbing)
calls than left-handed marmosets when they were presented with a fear-inducing
stimulus and performed more head cocking and parallax movements than the
left-handed marmosets. Hence, hand preference is associated with differences in
exploratory and social behavior, the latter including vocal communication.

BACKGROUND: Callithrix jacchus is a small primate widely used in experimentation,
but data on plasma total protein (PTP) values of free-living animals inhabiting
its own endemism region are non-existent.
METHODS: Marmosets belonging to two free-living groups were captured for marking 
and obtaining biological material. The collected blood was centrifuged to obtain 
the plasma and thus to determine the concentration of PTP.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Females and adults had the highest mean PTP. Mean found 
were higher than other values described for other neotropical primates, and the
high PTP values presented by the animals indicate dehydration. Due to the
importance of total plasma proteins for health and management, obtaining these
values as a reference is relevant for the free-living Callithrix genus and other 
neotropical primates.

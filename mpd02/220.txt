Age-related changes in the human testis may include morphological alterations,
disturbed steroidogenesis, and impaired spermatogenesis. However, the specific
impact of cell age remains poorly understood and difficult to assess. Testicular 
peritubular cells fulfill essential functions, including sperm transport,
contributions to the spermatogonial stem cell niche, and paracrine interactions
within the testis. To study their role in age-associated decline of testicular
functions, we performed comprehensive proteome and secretome analyses of
repeatedly passaged peritubular cells from Callithrix jacchus. This nonhuman
primate model better reflects the human testicular biology than rodents and
further gives access to young donors unavailable from humans. Among 5095
identified proteins, 583 were differentially abundant between samples with low
and high passage numbers. The alterations indicate a reduced ability of senescent
peritubular cells to contract and secrete proteins, as well as disturbances in
nuclear factor (NF)-κB signaling and a reduced capacity to handle reactive oxygen
species. Since this in vitro model may not exactly mirror all molecular aspects
of in vivo aging, we investigated the proteomes and secretomes of testicular
peritubular cells from young and old donors. Even though the age-related
alterations at the protein level were less pronounced, we found evidence for
impaired protein secretion, altered NF-κB signaling, and reduced contractility of
these in vivo aged peritubular cells.

While the fundamental importance of the white matter in supporting neuronal
communication is well known, existing publications of primate brains do not
feature a detailed description of its complex anatomy. The main barrier to
achieving this is that existing primate neuroimaging data have insufficient
spatial resolution to resolve white matter pathways fully. Here we present a
resource that allows detailed descriptions of white matter structures and
trajectories of fiber pathways in the marmoset brain. The resource includes: (1) 
the highest-resolution diffusion-weighted MRI data available to date, which
reveal white matter features not previously described; (2) a comprehensive
three-dimensional white matter atlas depicting fiber pathways that were either
omitted or misidentified in previous atlases; and (3) comprehensive fiber pathway
maps of cortical connections combining diffusion-weighted MRI tractography and
neuronal tracing data. The resource, which can be downloaded from
marmosetbrainmapping.org, will facilitate studies of brain connectivity and the
development of tractography algorithms in the primate brain.

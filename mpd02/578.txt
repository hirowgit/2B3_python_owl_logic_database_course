The study of neuronal responses to random-dot motion patterns has provided some
of the most valuable insights into how the activity of neurons is related to
perception. In the opposite directions of motion paradigm, the motion signal
strength is decreased by manipulating the coherence of random dot patterns to
examine how well the activity of single neurons represents the direction of
motion. To extend this paradigm to populations of neurons, studies have used
modelling based on data from pairs of neurons, but several important questions
require further investigation with larger neuronal datasets. We recorded neuronal
populations in the middle temporal (MT) and medial superior temporal (MST) areas 
of anaesthetized marmosets with electrode arrays, while varying the coherence of 
random dot patterns in two opposite directions of motion (left and right). Using 
the spike rates of simultaneously recorded neurons, we decoded the direction of
motion at each level of coherence with linear classifiers. We found that the
presence of correlations had a detrimental effect to decoding performance, but
that learning the correlation structure produced better decoding performance
compared to decoders that ignored the correlation structure. We also found that
reducing motion coherence increased neuronal correlations, but decoders did not
need to be optimized for each coherence level. Finally, we showed that decoder
weights depend of left-right selectivity at 100% coherence, rather than the
preferred direction. These results have implications for understanding how the
information encoded by populations of neurons is affected by correlations in
spiking activity.

Forty-five human rabies virus isolates from a wide geographical area of Brazil
were characterized using an anti-nucleoprotein monoclonal antibody panel and by
partial nucleotide sequencing analysis of the nucleoprotein gene. Three major
antigenic groups related to the antigenic variants maintained in domestic dogs,
vampire bats and marmosets were identified. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that
the viruses from dog-related cases segregated into four sister clades: three
associated with dog-endemic cycles in Brazil and one with the crab-eating fox
cycle in the northeastern region of the country. The vampire bat- and
marmoset-related viruses formed two independent groups. The topology of these
clades was conserved when these samples were compared to virus representatives of
the currently reported rabies endemic cycles in the Americas. These results
indicated the presence of multiple endemic transmission cycles maintained in four
different reservoirs, domestic dogs, crab-eating foxes, vampire bats and
marmosets, which are being transmitted directly to humans and should be
considered as a high-risk for rabies infection.

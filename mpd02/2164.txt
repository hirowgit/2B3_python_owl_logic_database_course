The efficacy of many new immunomodulatory therapies for multiple sclerosis (MS)
patients has often been disappointing, reflecting our incomplete understanding of
this enigmatic disease. There is a growing awareness that, at least in part,
there may be limited applicability to the human disease of results obtained in
the widely studied MS model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in rodents.
This review describes the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model
developed in a small neotropical primate, the common marmoset (Callithrix
jacchus). The model has features including clinicopathologic correlation
patterns, lesion heterogeneity, immunologic mechanisms, and disease markers that 
more closely mimic the human disease. Several unique features of experimental
autoimmune encephalomyelitis in marmosets, together with their outbred nature and
close genetic and immunologic similarities to humans, create an attractive
experimental model for translational research into MS, particularly for the
preclinical evaluation of new biologic therapeutic molecules that cannot be
investigated in rodents because of their species specificity. Moreover, this
model provides new insights into possible pathogenetic mechanisms in MS.

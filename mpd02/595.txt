Behavioral flexibility, which allows organisms to adapt their actions in response
to environmental changes, is impaired in a number of neuropsychiatric conditions,
including obsessive-compulsive disorder and addiction. Studies in human subjects 
and monkeys have reported correlations between individual differences in dopamine
D2-type receptor (D2R) levels in the caudate nucleus and performance in a
discrimination reversal task, in which established contingent relationships
between abstract stimuli and rewards (or punishments) are reversed. Global
genetic deletion of the D2R in mice disrupts reversal performance, indicating a
likely causal role for this receptor in supporting flexible behaviors. To
directly examine the specific role of caudate D2-type receptors in reversal
performance, the D2/3/4R agonist quinpirole was infused via chronic indwelling
cannulae into the medial caudate of male and female marmoset monkeys performing a
touchscreen-based serial discrimination reversal task. Given prior evidence for
dose-dependent effects of quinpirole and other dopaminergic drugs, a
fullÂ dose-response curve was established. Individually, marmosets displayed
marked differences in behavioral sensitivity to specific doses of intra-caudate
quinpirole. Collectively, they exhibited a behaviorally specific bi-phasic
deficit in reversal learning, being consistently impaired at both relatively low 
and high doses of quinpirole. However, intermediate doses of intra-caudate
quinpirole produced significant improvement in reversal performance. These data
support previous human and monkey neuroimaging studies by providing causal
evidence of a U-shaped function describing how dopamine modulates cognitive
flexibility in the primate striatum.

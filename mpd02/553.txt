BACKGROUND: Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in the common
marmoset is a nonhuman primate model of multiple sclerosis (MS) that shares
numerous clinical, radiological, and pathological features with MS. Among the
clinical features are motor and sensory deficits that are highly suggestive of
spinal cord (SC) damage.
OBJECTIVE: To characterize the extent and nature of SC damage in symptomatic
marmosets with EAE using a combined magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
histopathology approach.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: SC tissues from five animals were scanned using 7 T MRI to
collect high-resolution ex vivo images. Lesions were segmented and classified
based on shape, size, and distribution along the SC. Tissues were processed for
histopathological characterization (myelin and microglia/macrophages).
Statistical analysis, using linear mixed-effects models, evaluated the
association between MRI and histopathology.
RESULTS: Marmosets with EAE displayed two types of SC lesions: focal and subpial 
lesions. Both lesion types were heterogeneous in size and configuration and
corresponded to areas of marked demyelination with high density of inflammatory
cells. Inside the lesions, the MRI signal was significantly correlated with
myelin content (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings underscore the relevance of this nonhuman primate EAE
model for better understanding mechanisms of MS lesion formation in the SC.

Data from published sources about size and composition of wild common marmoset
groups (Callithrix jacchus) were analyzed to see if the number of juveniles in a 
group is closely related to the number of other group members. Mean group size
was 8.7 members including 4.4 adults (1.8 females, 2.5 males), 2.9 subadults, and
1.4 juveniles. The number of juveniles was significantly positively correlated to
the number of adult males. Groups with one or two adult males had significantly
fewer juveniles (mean: 1:1 juveniles) than groups containing more than two adult 
males (mean: 2.0 juveniles). Apart from a different number of subadults, results 
showed obvious similarities between common marmosets and tamarins of the genus
Saguinus in size and composition of subgroups of adults as well as the key role
of adult males in mediating the reproductive success of a breeding female. Common
marmoset females seem to gain direct fitness benefits in increased reproductive
success from the presence of a larger number of adult males. Whether or not other
group members get fitness benefits depends on the reproductive strategy of adult 
males (monogamy vs. polyandry), their kinship, and on the genetic relationship of
nonbreeders to the offspring of the breeding female. © 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

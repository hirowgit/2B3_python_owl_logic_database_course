The placental and plasma cystine aminopeptidase (CAP) in pregnant animals was
examined on stability after the treatment with L-methionine, ethylene diamine
tetra-acetic acid (EDTA) and heat. Inhibitory effects of these treatments on
enzyme activities were different among CAPs from the animal species, however,
significant correlation in those effects between placental and plasma CAPs was
observed. These results suggested that plasma CAP might reflect placental CAP and
seemed to be available for estimating maternal gestational conditions.

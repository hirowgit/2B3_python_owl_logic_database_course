Developmental and reproductive toxicology testing in nonhuman primates (NHPs) has
become more common due to the increasing number of biopharmaceuticals in drug
development, since NHPs are frequently the only species to express pharmacologic 
responses similar to humans. NHPs may also be used to help resolve issues
associated with small-molecule reproductive toxicology in traditional species
(rodents and rabbits). Adequate designs in NHP are presented for developmental
toxicity (embryo-fetal development, pre-postnatal development, enhanced
pre-postnatal development), reproductive toxicity (male and female), and juvenile
toxicity studies. Optional parameters that may be included in these studies are
discussed, as are new study designs that consolidate multiple aspects of the
reproductive assessment and thereby conserve the limited supply of sexually
mature NHPs available for testing. The details described will assist scientists
in pharmaceutical, regulatory, and contract research organizations who are
involved in conducting these unique studies to optimize their design based on
case-by-case considerations.

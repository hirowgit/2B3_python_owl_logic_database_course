PURPOSE: The in vitro and in situ transport of CGP 65015
((+)-3-hydroxy-1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-hydroxyphenyl-methyl-1H-pyridin-4-on e), a
novel oral iron chelator, is described. The predictive power of these data in
assessing intestinal absorption in man is described.
METHODS: Caco-2 epithelial monolayer and in situ rat jejunum perfusion intestinal
permeability models were utilized. In vivo iron excretion and preliminary animal 
pharmacokinetic experiments were described. Ionization constants and
octanol/aqueous partition coefficients were measured potentiometrically.
Solubilities and intrinsic dissolution rates were determined using standard
procedures.
RESULTS: Caco-2 cell (Papp approximately 0.25 x 10(-6) cm x s(-1)) and rat
jejunum (Pw approximately 0.4) permeabilities of CGP 65015 were determined. The
log D(pH 7.4) of CGP 65015 was 0.58 and its aqueous solubility was < 0.5 mg x
ml(-1) (pH 3-9). The intrinsic dissolution rate of CGP 65015 in USP simulated
intestinal fluid was 0.012 mg x min(-1) x cm(-2). CGP 65015 promotes iron
excretion effectively and dose dependently in animals.
CONCLUSIONS: Caco-2 and rat intestinal permeabilities predict incomplete oral
absorption of CGP 65015 in man. Preliminary rat pharmacokinetics support this.
Physico-chemical data are, also, in line and suggest that CGP 65015 may, in
addition, be solubility/dissolution rate limited in vivo. Nevertheless, early
animal pharmacological data demonstrate that CGP 65015 is a viable oral iron
chelator candidate.

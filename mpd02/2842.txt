A series of 9 search tasks corresponding to the Piagetian Stages 3-6 of object
permanence were administered to 11 common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus). Success
rates varied strongly among tasks and marmosets, but the performances of most
subjects were above chance level on the majority of tasks of visible and
invisible displacements. Although up to 24 trials were administered in the tests,
subjects did not improve their performance across trials. Errors were due to
preferences for specific locations or boxes, simple search strategies, and
attentional deficits. The performances of at least 2 subjects that achieved very 
high scores up to the successive invisible displacement task suggest that this
species is able to represent the existence and the movements of unperceived
objects.

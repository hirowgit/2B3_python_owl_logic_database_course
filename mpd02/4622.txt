Cloprostenol-induced luteolysis in the marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus).

Summers PM, Wennink CJ, Hodges JK.

A single intramuscular injection of 0.5 micrograms cloprostenol was not
luteolytic on Day 6 or 7 of the ovarian cycle (N = 3), but was luteolytic in some
animals (3/5) on Day 8 and 9 and luteolytic in all 23 animals treated between
Days 10 and 17 of the ovarian cycle, and in 7 animals treated between Days 19 and
43 of pregnancy. Luteal function was monitored by measurement of progesterone in 
peripheral blood using a simple and rapid non-extraction assay. There was a
dramatic fall in peripheral blood progesterone to less than 10 ng/ml within 24 h 
of cloprostenol injection; progesterone remained at this low level until the day 
after post-treatment ovulation. The interval from cloprostenol injection to
ovulation in animals treated between Days 8 and 17 was 10.7 +/- 0.3 days. A
similar interval was found in pregnant animals. Embryos recovered from the uterus
after cloprostenol treatment were morphologically normal (23/24).

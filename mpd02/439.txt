Genetically modified nonhuman primates (NHP) are useful models for biomedical
research. Gene editing technologies have enabled production of target-gene
knock-out (KO) NHP models. Target-gene-KO/knock-in (KI) efficiency of CRISPR/Cas9
has not been extensively investigated in marmosets. In this study, optimum
conditions for target gene modification efficacies of CRISPR/mRNA and
CRISPR/nuclease in marmoset embryos were examined. CRISPR/nuclease was more
effective than CRISPR/mRNA in avoiding mosaic genetic alteration. Furthermore,
optimal conditions to generate KI marmoset embryos were investigated using
CRISPR/Cas9 and 2 different lengths (36 nt and 100 nt) each of a sense or
anti-sense single-strand oligonucleotide (ssODN). KIs were observed when
CRISPR/nuclease and 36 nt sense or anti-sense ssODNs were injected into embryos. 
All embryos exhibited mosaic mutations with KI and KO, or imprecise KI, of c-kit.
Although further improvement of KI strategies is required, these results
indicated that CRISPR/Cas9 may be utilized to produce KO/KI marmosets via gene
editing.

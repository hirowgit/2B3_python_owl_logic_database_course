The spatial memory of common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus jacchus) was explored 
in 3 experiments with a simulated foraging task. In Experiment 1, individual
monkeys foraged among 8 baited food sites. They appeared to use spatial memory to
accurately avoid revisiting previously depleted sites. There was no difference in
accuracy between the adult monkeys and a juvenile monkey tested on the same task.
In Experiment 2, a win-stay paradigm was used. The adult monkey subject very
accurately remembered locations that had previously contained food. The monkey
tended to visit adjacent correct sites when retrieving food and thus minimized
the total distance travelled. In Experiment 3, a win-shift paradigm was used with
2 adult monkeys. Although both monkeys performed at above-chance levels of
accuracy on the win-shift task, they made many errors. These results suggest that
marmosets may prefer tasks that require a win-stay strategy.

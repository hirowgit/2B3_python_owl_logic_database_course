The distribution of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) within the brain of the common
marmoset, a non-human primate species, was investigated using the
[3H]L-citrulline formation assay and Western blot analysis. No hemispheric
asymmetry of specific NOS activity was shown. The highest levels of NOS were
found in the putamen and caudate nucleus--more than twice those in the cortex and
the cerebellum, the brain regions with the lowest activities. The regional
distribution pattern was similar to that in the ferret brain and contrasted to
that in the mouse and bovine brain. Analysis of NOS catalytic activities in
subcellular fractions revealed marked differences in the subcellular
localization. Neuronal NOS accounted mainly for the measured catalytic activity
in the brain. Differences in the regional distribution pattern of brain NOS
activity among species may be indicative of diversities in the functional role of
nitric oxide and NOS in mammals.

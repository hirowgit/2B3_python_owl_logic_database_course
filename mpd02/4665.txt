Ovariectomy does not abolish proceptive behaviour cyclicity in the common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).

Kendrick KM, Dixson AF.

Unlike in other non-human primates, ovariectomy of the female marmoset did not
alter heterosexual interactions. Proceptive behaviour bouts retained the same
cyclicity, duration and frequency within tests as during the ovarian cycle.
Significant rises in plasma levels of cortisol, progesterone, oestrone and
testosterone were found during these proceptive behaviour bouts and in cortisol, 
progesterone and oestrone at their onset. Results suggest a role for
adrenocortical steroids in both maintaining female sexuality and regulating its
cyclicity during ovarian cycles in this primate.

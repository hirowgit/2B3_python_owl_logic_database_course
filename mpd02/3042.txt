A seven-task behavioral test was performed on 86 common marmoset (Callithrix
jacchus) infants, 24-36 h following birth. This report describes the test outcome
and its relation to physical condition and survival of the infants. The
percentage of infants receiving a perfect score on a given task ranged from 30.6 
(rooting) to 70.6% (grasping). Heavier infants were more likely to have perfect
scores for crawling (F=4.20, P=0.044) and infants with a longer knee-heel length 
tended to be more likely to have a perfect grasping score (F=3.63, P=0.06). While
the modal score was a perfect score for most individual tasks, the modal number
of total perfect scores that a given infant received was 3-4 and only 4.7% of
infants received perfect scores on all seven tasks. These results suggest that
this group of behavioral tasks will produce a variable response within a
population of neonates. While no individual behavioral score predicted survival
during week 1, the number of perfect scores across all tasks was predictive of
survival outcome; infants with a higher total number of perfect scores were more 
likely to survive (F=6.02, P=0.018). When all combinations of tests were
compared, the best predictor of survival was outcome on four of the seven tests, 
all related to motor skills (F=7.46, P=0.009).

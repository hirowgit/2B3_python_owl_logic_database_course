The development of the marmoset as a translational model for healthspan and
lifespan studies relies on the characterization of health parameters in young and
geriatric marmosets. This cross-sectional study examined health phenotypes in
marmosets for five domains of interest for human health and aging: mobility,
cognition, metabolism, homeostasis, and immune function. Geriatric marmosets were
found to have significant executive function impairment when compared to young
animals. While geriatric animals did not show gross abnormalities in mobility and
measures of locomotion, their types of movement were altered from young animals. 
Geriatric marmosets had alterations in cardiac function, with significantly
increased mean arterial pressures; metabolism, with significantly lower VO2 ; and
suppressed immune function. Further, this study sought to characterize and
describe histopathology for both young and geriatric healthy marmosets. Overall
this study provides a characterization of health parameters for young and
geriatric marmosets which will greatly enhance future aging and interventional
testing in marmosets.

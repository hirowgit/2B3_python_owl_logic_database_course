Pitch, our perception of how high or low a sound is on a musical scale, is a
fundamental perceptual attribute of sounds and is important for both music and
speech. After more than a century of research, the exact mechanisms used by the
auditory system to extract pitch are still being debated. Theoretically, pitch
can be computed using either spectral or temporal acoustic features of a sound.
We have investigated how cues derived from the temporal envelope and spectrum of 
an acoustic signal are used for pitch extraction in the common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus), a vocal primate species, by measuring pitch discrimination 
behaviorally and examining pitch-selective neuronal responses in auditory cortex.
We find that pitch is extracted by marmosets using temporal envelope cues for
lower pitch sounds composed of higher-order harmonics, whereas spectral cues are 
used for higher pitch sounds with lower-order harmonics. Our data support
dual-pitch processing mechanisms, originally proposed by psychophysicists based
on human studies, whereby pitch is extracted using a combination of temporal
envelope and spectral cues.

BACKGROUND: Biomedical research has recently focused on developing new models of 
human disease by implementing genome-editing strategies in non-human primates
(NHPs) to introduce relevant gene mutations. There is a need to establish
objective semen evaluation methods to select sires for in vitro fertilization to 
perform germline editing in embryos.
METHODS: Sperm motility kinematic parameters were evaluated using a
computer-assisted semen analysis (CASA) instrument for rhesus macaques (Macaca
mulatta), cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis), and common marmosets
(Callithrix jacchus).
RESULTS: Normative sperm kinematic parameters were established, revealing
differences between marmosets and macaques. The impact of season on rhesus
macaque sperm motility was modest, where changes in sperm motility related to
season were dependent on the individual male.
CONCLUSIONS: These data provide a baseline of normative kinematic parameters for 
three captive NHP species, in which implementation of CASA may serve as a tool to
evaluate NHP semen quality.

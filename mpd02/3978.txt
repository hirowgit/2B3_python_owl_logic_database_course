The timing of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) development in the cotton-eared
marmoset was studied by histological examination of joints taken during
embryogenesis and compared with TMJ development reported in man. Specimens were
obtained via hysterotomy at intervals during pregnancies dated by estimation of
uterine size or fetal head diameter. Elements of the marmoset TMJ were first
identified at 70-85 days gestation, and TMJ morphogenesis was complete at 110-125
days. The chronological events of TMJ embryogenesis were found to run parallel to
the human but were delayed by 30 days. At birth, after 150 days gestation, the
marmoset TMJ resembled the human joint at the end of the second trimester, with
all cell layers of the condylar cartilage in place and ossification started in
temporal and condylar components. A new world primate, the cotton-eared marmoset 
is proposed as an animal model for craniofacial studies involving the TMJ on
grounds of its close comparability to man.

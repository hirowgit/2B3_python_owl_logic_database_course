Indirect immunofluorescence staining with human anti-kinetochore antibodies was
used to study the position of centromeres during vertebrate spermiogenesis. Many 
species of Amphibia have a low chromosome number and very large spermatids and
spermatozoa. The number of kinetochore dots correlates exactly with the haploid
chromosome number. This implies that kinetochore duplication occurs in the
interval between meiosis I and meiosis II. The nonhomologous centromeres are
arranged in tandem during the entire course of spermiogenesis and in mature
spermatozoa. A higher order centromere arrangement was found in spermiogenic
cells of Anura and Urodela. In mammals, immunofluorescence analysis is
complicated by the extreme condensation of chromatin during spermiogenesis and
the high chromosome numbers. Nevertheless, centromere-centromere associations
were observed in mammalian round spermatids and sporadically in testicular
spermatozoa. This indicates that pair-wise association of centromeres is a
universal principle of centromere arrangement at the postmeiotic stage.

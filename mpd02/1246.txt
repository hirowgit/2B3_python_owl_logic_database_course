In auditory cortex, temporal information within a sound is represented by two
complementary neural codes: a temporal representation based on stimulus-locked
firing and a rate representation, where discharge rate co-varies with the timing 
between acoustic events but lacks a stimulus-synchronized response. Using a
computational neuronal model, we find that stimulus-locked responses are
generated when sound-evoked excitation is combined with strong, delayed
inhibition. In contrast to this, a non-synchronized rate representation is
generated when the net excitation evoked by the sound is weak, which occurs when 
excitation is coincident and balanced with inhibition. Using single-unit
recordings from awake marmosets (Callithrix jacchus), we validate several model
predictions, including differences in the temporal fidelity, discharge rates and 
temporal dynamics of stimulus-evoked responses between neurons with rate and
temporal representations. Together these data suggest that feedforward inhibition
provides a parsimonious explanation of the neural coding dichotomy observed in
auditory cortex.

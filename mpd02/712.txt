We demonstrate that phase retrieval and tomographic imaging at the organ level of
small animals can be advantageously carried out using the monochromatic radiation
emitted by a compact x-ray light source, without further optical elements apart
from source and detector. This approach allows to carry out microtomography
experiments which - due to the large performance gap with respect to conventional
laboratory instruments - so far were usually limited to synchrotron sources. We
demonstrate the potential by mapping the functional soft tissue within the guinea
pig and marmoset cochlea, including in the latter case an electrical cochlear
implant. We show how 3d microanatomical studies without dissection or microscopic
imaging can enhance future research on cochlear implants.

Identification of different subpopulations of neostriatal neurones projecting to 
globus pallidus or substantia nigra in the monkey: a retrograde fluorescence
double-labelling study.

FÃ©ger J, Crossman AR.

Fluorescent tracers (Nuclear Yellow, True Blue, Fast Blue) were injected, in
various combinations, into the globus pallidus and substantia nigra in three
marmosets. Examination of perikarya in the ipsilateral neostriatum, well removed 
from pallidal injection sites, revealed that the predominant pattern was of
single-labelled cells, retrogradely labelled from either the globus pallidus or
substantia nigra. It is suggested, on the basis of this evidence and data
previously available, that the striatum contains at least three types of efferent
neurones, one projecting exclusively to the globus pallidus, one projecting
exclusively to the substantia nigra, and another projecting to both structures.

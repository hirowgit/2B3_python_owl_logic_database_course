γ9δ2 T cells are a primate-specific γδ T cell subtype that expand and become
activated during infection, responding directly to phosphoantigens which are
by-products of essential metabolic pathways in both bacteria and mammals.
Analogues of natural phosphoantigens have been developed as potential
immunotherapeutics for treatment of tumours and infectious diseases. Several
non-human primate models have been used in preclinical studies, however, little
is known about marmoset γ9δ2 T cell responses. We identified γ9(+) T cells in
various tissues in the marmoset and determined that these cells respond to
phosphoantigen in a similar manner to human γ9δ2 T cells in vitro. Both human
γ9δ2 T cells and marmoset γ9(+) T cells were able to reduce growth of the
intracellular bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei in vitro following expansion
with phosphoantigen. This suggests that the marmoset is an appropriate model for 
examining the immunotherapeutic potential of compounds which target γ9δ2 T cells.

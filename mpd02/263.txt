Altered olfactory function is a common symptom of COVID-19, but its etiology is
unknown. A key question is whether SARS-CoV-2 (CoV-2) - the causal agent in
COVID-19 - affects olfaction directly, by infecting olfactory sensory neurons or 
their targets in the olfactory bulb, or indirectly, through perturbation of
supporting cells. Here we identify cell types in the olfactory epithelium and
olfactory bulb that express SARS-CoV-2 cell entry molecules. Bulk sequencing
demonstrated that mouse, non-human primate and human olfactory mucosa expresses
two key genes involved in CoV-2 entry, ACE2 and TMPRSS2. However, single cell
sequencing revealed that ACE2 is expressed in support cells, stem cells, and
perivascular cells, rather than in neurons. Immunostaining confirmed these
results and revealed pervasive expression of ACE2 protein in dorsally-located
olfactory epithelial sustentacular cells and olfactory bulb pericytes in the
mouse. These findings suggest that CoV-2 infection of non-neuronal cell types
leads to anosmia and related disturbances in odor perception in COVID-19
patients.

Chronic monitoring of neuronal activity in the living brain with optical imaging 
techniques became feasible owing to the continued development of genetically
encoded calcium indicators (GECIs). Here we report for the first time the
successful generation of transgenic marmosets (Callithrix jacchus), an important 
nonhuman primate model in neurophysiological research, which were engineered to
express the green fluorescent protein (GFP)-based family of GECIs, GCaMP, under
control of either the CMV or the hSyn promoter. High titer lentiviral vectors
were produced, and injected into embryos collected from donor females. The
infected embryos were then transferred to recipient females. Eight transgenic
animals were born and shown to have stable and functional GCaMP expression in
several different tissues. Germline transmission of the transgene was confirmed
in embryos generated from two of the founder transgenic marmosets that reached
sexual maturity. These embryos were implanted into six recipient females, three
of which became pregnant and are in advanced stages of gestation. We believe
these transgenic marmosets will be invaluable non-human primate models in
neuroscience, allowing chronic in vivo monitoring of neural activity with
functional confocal and multi-photon optical microscopy imaging of intracellular 
calcium dynamics.

The majority of studies on cardiac morphology have concentrated on Old World
monkeys. Ten marmoset hearts of the genus Callithrix were studied (5 hearts of C.
jacchus and 5 of C. penicillata), dissected and fixed in a 10% buffered
formaldehyde solution, pH 7.2. Unbiased stereological estimates were obtained
from isotropic uniform random sections of the myocardium. For stereological
quantification the myocardium was regarded as consisting of cardiac myocytes and 
interstitium. The volume density (Vv) was determined by point counting. We used
the disector method to obtain the numerical density of the cardiac myocytes
(Nv[nuclei]). Myocardial stereological differences between the two species of
marmoset were not statistically significant. We can therefore determine the
pooled Vv[myocyte] and Nv[nuclei] as 68.6% and 41.6% (10(3)/mm3) respectively.
The values found for Vv[myocyte] and Nv[nuclei] in the marmoset are respectively 
about 23.0 and 92.0% greater than those of the baboon, and respectively 57.3 and 
45.5% greater than those in man. In contrast, the mean myocyte volume in the
marmoset is not significantly different to that of man but is almost 36.0% less
than that of the baboon.

Despite the importance of transition metals for normal brain function, relatively
little is known about the distribution of these elemental species across the
different tissue compartments of the primate brain. In this study, we employed
laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry on PFA-fixed brain
sections obtained from two adult common marmosets. Concurrent cytoarchitectonic, 
myeloarchitectonic, and chemoarchitectonic measurements allowed for
identification of the major neocortical, archaecortical, and subcortical
divisions of the brain, and precise localisation of iron, manganese, and zinc
concentrations within each division. Major findings across tissue compartments
included: (1) differentiation of white matter tracts from grey matter based on
manganese and zinc distribution; (2) high iron concentrations in the basal
ganglia, cortex, and substantia nigra; (3) co-localization of high concentrations
of iron and manganese in the primary sensory areas of the cerebral cortex; and
(4) high manganese in the hippocampus. The marmoset has become a model species of
choice for connectomic, aging, and transgenic studies in primates, and the
application of metallomics to these disciplines has the potential to yield high
translational and basic science value.

BACKGROUND: Marmosets and tamarins are increasingly used in research, but their
pathology remains poorly defined compared with Old World primates.
METHODS: Necropsy records of 129 marmosets and 52 tamarins were reviewed; none
was used experimentally.
RESULTS: The most common marmoset lesions were dehydration, emaciation,
nephritis, colitis, and inanition. The most common tamarin lesions were
dehydration, ascites, emaciation, and congestive heart failure. Colitis and heart
disease were the most common cause of death in marmosets and tamarins,
respectively. Immature marmoset and tamarin deaths often occurred within the
first month of life. Immature marmosets usually died from inanition, stillbirth, 
and colitis; immature tamarins from atelectasis, stillbirth, heart failure, and
colitis. Lymphoma was the most common neoplasm for both marmosets and tamarins.
CONCLUSION: The findings were similar to prior reports with differences in
frequency and severity. We report the first case of endometriosis in a marmoset.

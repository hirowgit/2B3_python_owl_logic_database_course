Here we demonstrate differences in the relative performance of 15 callitrichids
tested in a series of color visual discrimination experiments. Munsell color
chips were chosen as stimuli based on their use in earlier experiments with human
dichromats. We show behavioral evidence for the existence of four distinct kinds 
of color-vision phenotypes, each of which has slightly different color
discrimination abilities. The different phenotypes may offer different
advantages. The data are in accordance with the existence of a visual
polymorphism in callitrichids.

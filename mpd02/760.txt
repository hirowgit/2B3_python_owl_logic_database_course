With the loss and fragmentation of tropical forests, the survival of primates
depends on their ability to adapt to human-introduced modifications in their
habitat. Marmosets are known for their ecological and behavioral plasticity and
have been registered in various agricultural landscapes. Our goal was to describe
the ecology of tufted-ear marmosets (Callithrix sp.) in a rubber/forest
landscape, monitoring their use of habitat and diet. We followed two groups using
radio telemetry and visual observations for nine months at the Michelin
plantation Ltd. in Bahia, Brazil. Both groups used mainly pioneer forest and
rubber with pioneer vegetation more than expected according to availability, even
though they explored all types of vegetation. Rubber monocultures act as
corridors for marmoset locomotion among more suitable habitats. Feeding,
gummivory and socialization were mainly performed in the pioneer forest (with or 
without rubber), in which most sleeping sites and food sources were found. Groups
of marmosets can incorporate agroforest matrixes to their area of use and
activity patterns. Maintenance of marmosets in fragmented landscapes might be
favored by their diet flexibility, with the use of resources such as gum and
fruit, including exotic plants. Although known for their ecological flexibility, 
marmosets do require certain resources to be present in native habitat to adapt
to agricultural landscapes. Patches of forest within a rubber landscape and
pioneer vegetation in the rubber inter-rows should be considered to maintain
populations of Callithrix in rubber landscapes.

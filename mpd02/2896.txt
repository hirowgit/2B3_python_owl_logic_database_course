Marmosets, especially Callithrix jacchus, have become an established part of the 
laboratory animal community. Information on marmoset life history, behavior, and 
diet acquired from experience with natural and captive habitats has increased,
but the early information from workers with colonies, principally those of
tamarins, has led to some common perceptions about how to house, handle, and
especially, feed callitrichids that may not apply to marmoset requirements. The
availability of commercially produced, almost-complete base diet components and a
wider variety of cage construction materials, combined with the recent emphasis
on the integration of engineering and performance standards for housing, have
made captive life and the implementation of research requirements better for the 
animals and the people that work with them. We will review some of the routine
aspects of husbandry, handling, and nutrition for marmoset monkeys maintained in 
a research setting.

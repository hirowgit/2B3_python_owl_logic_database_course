We have raised antibodies that selectively recognize an exon 9 skipping form of
GLAST. We demonstrate expression of this protein in brains of rats, cats, monkeys
and humans. Immunolabelling was present in scattered populations of neurons,
particularly in cerebral cortex and colliculi. Neurons were often present in
small clusters and exhibited a range of morphologies, from apparently normal to
highly degenerate. GLAST1b was also expressed by some glial cells. Cortical
neurons expressing the exon 9 skipping form of GLAST also labelled with
antibodies against the C- or N-terminal regions of GLAST. We suggest that
alternate splicing of GLAST by subpopulations of neurons may indicate some
dysfunction in these cells, and may be an indicator of inappropriate local
excitation.

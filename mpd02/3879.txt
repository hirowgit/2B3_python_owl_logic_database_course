The expression and distribution of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) was studied by use
of the newly designed specific histochemical NADPH diaphorase staining method and
the indirect immunofluorescence technique employing an antiserum to brain NOS in 
visceral and somatic striated muscles of several mammalian species. Histochemical
activity and immunoreactivity were located in the sarcolemma region of type I and
II fibers of all muscles investigated. Visceral muscles were more strongly
stained than somatic muscles. Furthermore, type II fibers, identified by staining
of myosin adenosine triphosphatase activity after pre-incubation at alkaline pH, 
were more intensely labeled than type I fibers. In addition, NOS activity was
detected in the area of the sarcolemma of intrafusal fibers. No obvious
differences between species were observed. It was concluded that NOS of striated 
muscles probably makes up the richest and most important nitric oxide source in
mammals.

In vitro transforming activity of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). II. Differences
between M81 and B95-8 EBV strains.

Desgranges C, Lavoué MF, Patet J, de-Thé G.

Lymphocytes from 38 human cord blood and 9 adult circulating blood were aliquoted
and infected in parallel either with the B95-8 EBV strain (produced by cotton-top
marmoset lymphocytes transformed by EBV originating from an infectious
mononucleosis line) or with the M81 EB virus (produced by callithrix jacchus
marmoset lymphocytes transformed by EBV originating from a nasopharyngeal
carcinoma (NPC) derived line). Significant differences were observed in the
lymphoblastoid lines obtained and involved cell morphology, cell growth and
synthesis of viral antigen. Cord blood lymphocytes infected with M81 virus
resulted in lymphoblastoid lines where EA and VCA synthesis and production of
virions took place, whereas this was not observed in B95-8 induced lines.

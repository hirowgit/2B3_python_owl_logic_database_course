The pygmy marmoset, Cebuella pygmaea, the smallest of the New World monkeys, has 
one of the largest geographical distributions of the Amazonian primates. Two
forms have been recognized: Cebuella pygmaea pygmaea (Spix, 1823), and C. p.
niveiventris Lönnberg, 1940. In this study, we investigated if the separation of 
pygmy marmosets into these two clades can be corroborated by molecular data. We
also examine and compare coloration of the pelage in light of the new molecular
results. We analyzed the mtDNA cytochrome b gene and, for the first time for any 
Neotropical primate, we used a reduced representation genome sequencing approach 
(ddRADseq) to obtain data for recently collected, geographically representative
samples from the Rio Japurá, a northern tributary of the Rio Solimões and from
the Javarí, Jutaí, Juruá, Madeira and Purus river basins, all tributaries south
of the Solimões. We estimated phylogenies and diversification times under both
maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference criteria. Our analysis showed two
highly supported clades, with intraclade divergences much smaller than interclade
divergences, indicating two species of Cebuella: one from the Rio Japurá and one 
to the south of Solimões. The interpretation of our results in light of the
current taxonomy is not trivial however. Lönnberg stated that the type of Spix's 
pygmy marmoset (type locality 'near Tabatinga') was obtained from the south of
the Solimões, and his description of the distinct niveiventris from Lago Ipixuna,
south of the Solimões and several hundred kilometres east of Tabatinga, was based
on a comparison with specimens that he determined as typical pygmaea that were
from the upper Rio Juruá (south of the Solimões). As such it remains uncertain
whether the name pygmaea should be applicable to the pygmy marmosets north of the
Rio Solimões (Tabatinga type locality) or south (near Tabatinga but across the
Solimões). Finally, our analysis of pelage coloration revealed three phenotypic
forms: (1) south of the Rio Solimoes, (2) Eirunepé-Acre, upper Juruá basin; and
(3) Japurá. More samples from both sides of Solimões in the region of Tabatinga
will be necessary to ascertain the exact type locality for Spix's pygmaea and to 
resolve the current uncertainties surrounding pygmy marmoset taxonomy.

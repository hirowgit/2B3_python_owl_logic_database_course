Hematological studies have been carried out on a group of 96 common marmosets
(Callithrix jacchus) on which full clinical histories were available. The group
included both healthy and sick animals. Reference values for red-cell,
white-cell, and platelet counts; hemoglobin levels; packed cell volumes; red- and
white-cell absolute values; reticulocyte counts; and fibrinogen levels were
calculated from results obtained in 43 clinically normal individuals. These
reference values have been used to identify hematological abnormalities in sick
animals so that relationships between the blood picture and the clinical findings
could be defined. Leucopenia, raised platelet counts, and high fibrinogen levels 
were found in animals with bacterial infections and carried poor prognosis. Heinz
bodies occurred in a significant number of the group as a whole, and were
associated with a variety of hematological and clinical abnormalities. These
findings illustrate the diagnostic and prognostic value of clinical hematology in
C. jacchus.

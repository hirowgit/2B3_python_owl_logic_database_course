Marmosets have attracted significant interest in the life sciences. Similarities 
with human brain anatomy and physiology, such as the granular frontal cortex, as 
well as the development of transgenic lines and potential for transferring rodent
neuroscientific techniques to small primates make them a promising
neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric model system. However, whether marmosets
can exhibit complex motor tasks in highly controlled experimental designs-one of 
the prerequisites for investigating higher-order control mechanisms underlying
cognitive motor behavior-has not been demonstrated. We show that marmosets can be
trained to perform vocal behavior in response to arbitrary visual cues in
controlled operant conditioning tasks. Our results emphasize the marmoset as a
suitable model to study complex motor behavior and the evolution of cognitive
control underlying speech.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a New World primate species
frequently employed for immunological models of human disease. We used flow
cytometry to screen a panel of new anti-human antibodies from the HLDA8 workshop 
to establish cross-reactivity with marmoset peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
Seventy-seven antibodies were screened of which nine antibodies showed binding.
Cross-reactivity of anti-human monoclonal antibodies with CC and CXC chemokine
receptors CCR3, CCR6, CCR7, and CCR8 was demonstrated on untreated marmoset
mononuclear cells. Stimulation of marmoset mononuclear cells with ConA and/or
PMA-ionomycin resulted in an up-regulated expression of CXCR1, CXCR3, and CXCR4. 
The expression of TNF-family related molecules TACI and APRIL on marmoset
mononuclear cells was also identified. These studies extend the range of
cross-reactive antibodies to now include anti-chemokine and anti-TNF family
antibodies for this important pre-clinical model species and should provide
useful tools for investigation of immunological processes in marmoset monkey
models.

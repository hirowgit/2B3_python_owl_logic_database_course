We have studied the arrangement of the pectineal ligament or its equivalent, the 
uveal trabecula, in herbivores, carnivores, primates and humans. From our
investigations, the pectineal ligament, the uveal trabecula and the so-called
processes of the iris form a morphological unit that is made up of the tendinous 
fibres of the longitudinal portion of the ciliary muscle, that are inserted into 
the periphery of Descemet's membrane and send out ahead prolongations that extend
to the anterior face of the iris. The so-called processes of the iris cannot be
considered as independent structures since they represent the innermost fibres of
the trabecular or uveal meshwork; in some species these have a thicker
appearance, an arrangement that can occasionally be found in the human eye.

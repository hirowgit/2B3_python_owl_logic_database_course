Most research on mechanisms of aging is being conducted in a very limited number 
of classical model species, i.e., laboratory mouse (Mus musculus), rat (Rattus
norvegicus domestica), the common fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) and
roundworm (Caenorhabditis elegans). The obvious advantages of using these models 
are access to resources such as strains with known genetic properties,
high-quality genomic and transcriptomic sequencing data, versatile experimental
manipulation capabilities including well-established genome editing tools, as
well as extensive experience in husbandry. However, this approach may introduce
interpretation biases due to the specific characteristics of the investigated
species, which may lead to inappropriate, or even false, generalization. For
example, it is still unclear to what extent knowledge of aging mechanisms gained 
in short-lived model organisms is transferable to long-lived species such as
humans. In addition, other specific adaptations favoring a long and healthy life 
from the immense evolutionary toolbox may be entirely missed. In this review, we 
summarize the specific characteristics of emerging animal models that have
attracted the attention of gerontologists, we provide an overview of the
available data and resources related to these models, and we summarize important 
insights gained from them in recent years. The models presented include
short-lived ones such as killifish (Nothobranchius furzeri), long-lived ones such
as primates (Callithrix jacchus, Cebus imitator, Macaca mulatta), bathyergid
mole-rats (Heterocephalus glaber, Fukomys spp.), bats (Myotis spp.), birds, olms 
(Proteus anguinus), turtles, greenland sharks, bivalves (Arctica islandica), and 
potentially non-aging ones such as Hydra and Planaria.

Detection and control of rotavirus infections in zoo animals.

Baumeister BM, Castro AE, McGuire-Rodgers SJ, Ramsay EC.

Fecal specimens from 15 exotic animal species, with and without diarrhea, were
examined for the presence of rotavirus, bacterial enteropathogens, and intestinal
parasites. A commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to detect
antigens of rotavirus. Rotavirus was detected in the feces of 20 (57%) of 35 of
the animals, which included addax (Addax nasomaculatus), nyala (Tragelaphus
angasi), saiga (Saiga tatarica), white-tailed gnu (Connochaetus gnou), greater
kudu (Tragelaphus strepsiceros), sitatunga (Tragelaphus spekei), Grant's gazelle 
(Gazella granti roosevelti), sable antelope (Hippotragus niger niger), kob (Kobus
kob leucotis), pygmy marmoset (Callithrix pygmaea), bush dog (Speothos
venaticus), grizzly bear (Ursus arctos horribilis), and red kangaroo (Megaleia
rufa). Bacterial pathogens were found in 8 animals, 5 of which had concurrent
rotavirus infections. Most (60%) of the animals with rotavirus infection were
less than 2 weeks old; however, rotavirus also was detected in feces from adult
animals. Although most of the cases of rotavirus infection were detected in
nursery-reared animals, exhibit-reared animals also were infected with rotavirus.

High-acuity vision in primates, including humans, is mediated by a small central 
retinal region called the fovea. As more accessible organisms lack a fovea, its
specialized function and its dysfunction in ocular diseases remain poorly
understood. We used 165,000 single-cell RNA-seq profiles to generate
comprehensive cellular taxonomies of macaque fovea and peripheral retina. More
than 80% of >60 cell types match between the two regions but exhibit substantial 
differences in proportions and gene expression, some of which we relate to
functional differences. Comparison of macaque retinal types with those of mice
reveals that interneuron types are tightly conserved. In contrast, projection
neuron types and programs diverge, despite exhibiting conserved transcription
factor codes. Key macaque types are conserved in humans, allowing mapping of
cell-type and region-specific expression of >190 genes associated with 7 human
retinal diseases. Our work provides a framework for comparative single-cell
analysis across tissue regions and species.

Changes in plasma concentrations of immunoreactive inhibin in the reproductively 
cyclic, pregnant and ovariectomized female marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus)
were measured with a heterologous radioimmunoassay. The pattern of inhibin
secretion in five marmosets studied individually during four consecutive cycles
was shown to resemble that of progesterone. In these animals, data were pooled
according to stage of cycle on the basis of plasma progesterone concentrations.
Mean values for inhibin were 5465 and 4972 U/l during the early and late
follicular phase. Concentrations rose during the luteal phase to 8431, 12,246 and
12,557 U/l for the early, mid- and late luteal phase respectively. The hormonal
profile of inhibin during the normal cycle is similar in both marmoset and
stumptailed macaque; however, the marmoset has a 28-fold greater level of inhibin
during the luteal phase. In six marmosets in which pregnancy occurred, inhibin
concentrations showed no decline at the end of the conceptual cycle and remained 
increased with respect to the follicular phase throughout the subsequent
gestation. Inhibin levels were non-detectable (less than 1000 U/l) in
ovariectomized and acyclic marmosets. These results suggest that the corpus
luteum is the major source of inhibin in this New World monkey, in common with
man and the Old World primates.

The common marmoset, Callithrix jacchus, can be infected with human
varicella-zoster virus (VZV), both wild-type strain KMcC and attenuated vaccine
strain Oka/Merck. Infection was accomplished with either whole-cell-associated or
cell extract VZV by combined oral-nasal-conjunctival application and was
characterized by substantial and persistent anti-VZV antibody responses. The
infectivity of VZV for marmosets was destroyed by treatment of inocula with heat 
or UV light. Diluted inocula with as few as 40 PFU/ml were infectious for
marmosets. The lungs were demonstrated to be a major site of viral replication;
both the presence of viral antigens and signs of pneumonia were demonstrated in
lung tissues. Four serial passages of VZV KMcC were carried out in C. jacchus by 
a process of in vitro isolation and culturing of VZV from infected lung tissue
and reapplication of the cultured isolates to fresh animals. The isolated viruses
were identified as VZV both serologically and by restriction endonuclease
analyses. The C. jacchus infectivity model should prove useful for determining
the efficacy of subunit and live recombinant VZV vaccines as well as for the
study of zoster.

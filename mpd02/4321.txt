In a captive group of common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus), consisting of six
group members and the three infants of the two breeding females, we analyzed
participation of all group members in infant carrying, and suckling by the two
breeding females. During the first two weeks of the infants' lives, the two
breeding females carried their own infant(s) almost exclusively due primarily to 
the mutual avoidance by the two females. At the beginning of the third week of
the infants' lives nearly all group members began to carry all infants to a
relatively high degree and both breeding females suckled all infants. The results
indicate that the greater energetic demands in rearing three infants
simultaneously are compensated by an extended division of labor among group
members. All breeding animals preferred to carry and to suckle the infants
according to kinship predictions. However, observed preferences of nonbreeding
group members in infant carrying seemed not to be related to different degrees of
genetic relatedness.

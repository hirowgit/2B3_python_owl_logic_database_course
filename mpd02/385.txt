Marmoset monkeys are known for their rich vocal repertoire. However, the
underlying call production mechanisms remain unclear. By showing that marmoset
moneys are capable of interrupting and modulating ongoing vocalizations, recent
studies in marmoset monkeys challenged the decades-old concepts of primate vocal 
pattern generation that suggested that monkey calls consist of one discrete call 
pattern. The current article will present a revised version of the brainstem
vocal pattern-generating network in marmoset monkeys that is capable of
responding to perturbing auditory stimuli with rapid modulatory changes of the
acoustic call structure during ongoing calls. These audio-vocal integration
processes might potentially happen at both the cortical and subcortical brain
level.

To obtain experimental support for possible milk-borne infection of human T-cell 
leukemia virus type-I (HTLV-I), short-term-cultured viral antigen-positive
lymphocytes obtained from peripheral blood of adult T-cell leukemia lymphoma
complex (ATLL) patients were inoculated into the oral cavity of two adult common 
marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) in amounts comparable to those of HTLV-I-carrying 
cells fed to a baby in the milk of seropositive mothers. One of the animals
seroconverted 2.5 months after the first inoculation. Cultures of peripheral
blood mononuclear leukocytes of the marmoset revealed HTLV-I antigen expression
in cells, indicating the establishment of oral infection of HTLV-I in an adult
marmoset. The cell number deduced to be responsible for the infection was 5.6 X
10(7) cells (used in the first 2 inoculations). The results suggest that the
concept of milk-borne infection of HTLV-I from a seropositive mother to her child
is plausible.

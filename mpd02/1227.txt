The γδ T cell lineage in humans remains much of an enigma due to the low number
of defined antigens, the non-canonical ways in which these cells respond to their
environment and difficulty in tracking this population in vivo. In this review,
we survey a comparative evolutionary analysis of the primate V, D and J gene
segments and contrast these findings with recent progress in defining antigen
recognition by different populations of γδ T cells in humans. Signatures of both 
purifying and diversifying selection at the Vδ and Vγ gene loci are placed into
context of Vδ1+ γδ T cell recognition of CD1d presenting different lipids, and Vγ
9Vδ2 T cell modulation by pyrophosphate-based phosphoantigens through the
butyrophilins BTN3A. From this comparison, it is clear that co-evolution between 
γδ TCRs and these ligands is likely occurring, but the diversity inherent in
these recombined receptors is an important feature in ligand surveillance.

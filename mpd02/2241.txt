Paramyxovirus Tianjin strain is a novel strain of virus causing common
cotton-eared marmoset fatal infection. To investigate the relationship between
the gene structure and function of nucleoprotein (NP) of Tianjin strain, NP gene 
of paramyxovirus Tianjin strain was cloned and three domains of NP were
expressed. The homologous and phylogenetic analysis of NP sequences among the
paramyxovirus Tianjin strain and eight strains of Sendai viruses from GenBank
were performed. The results indicated the recombinant proteins NP1, NP2 and NP3
showed the native antigenicity to the polyclonal antiserum of paramyxovirus
Tianjin strain, ranking as NP3>NP1>NP2 (precedence order). The homology of NP
nucleotide and the deduced amino acid sequences between paramyxovirus Tianjin
strain and Sendai virus BB1 strain were 94.5%, 96.2%, respectively, whereas the
identity were 85.1% - 88.7% and 92.4% - 94.7% among Tianjin strain and the 7
strains of Sendai viruses from GenBank respectively. There were 15 unique amino
acid substitutions in Tianjin strain NP protein and 11 common amino acid
substitutions same with BB1 strain. This research confirmed that paramyxovirus
Tianjin strain might be a new genotype of Sendai virus and can be helpful in the 
establishment of detection assay applying recombinant NP as antigen instead of
the whole virions.

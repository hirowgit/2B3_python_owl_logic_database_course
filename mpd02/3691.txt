In a colony of New World monkeys five tamarins (Saguinus oedipus, Saguinus
labiatus and Leontopithecus rosal. rosal.), three marmosets (Callithrix jacchus
and Callithrix pygmaea) and one saki (Pithecia pithecia) died suddenly. The
colony comprised 16 marmosets, 10 tamarins and three sakis. The main pathological
findings were necrotic lesions in the lung, the intestine, and the liver.
Histopathologically T. gondii parasites were observed in organs from the tamarins
and the marmosets but not in the saki. Some considerations on epidemiology are
presented. Preventive measures were directed against the bottom layer of the
cages, on cockroach extermination, and on freezing of raw meat.

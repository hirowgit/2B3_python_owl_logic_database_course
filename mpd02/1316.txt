BACKGROUND: Strongyloides stercoralis can undergo an alternative autoinfective
life cycle in the host, which, in some individuals can lead to a lethal
infection. However, due to a number of factors, such as, the majority of those
infected are from low-income backgrounds and the limitation in experimental
models for studying human S. stercoralis, strongyloidiasis remains neglected.
Improved knowledge of animal models that are susceptible to this parasite is
needed in order to investigate the immunological mechanisms involved during
infection and in particular to further understand the natural history of the
autoinfective cycle.
METHODS: Callithrix penicillata were inoculated subcutaneously with 100 (n = 2), 
300 (n = 4) or 500 (n = 9) third-stage infective larvae (L3i) of S. stercoralis
of human origin. Three marmosets received smaller inocula (i.e., one received 100
and two received 300 L3i) to ensure a greater capacity to withstand the infection
after immunosuppression, which was triggered by administration of dexamethasone
during early patency. Qualitative faecal analyses began at 7 days post-infection 
(DPI), and semi-quantitative tests were also performed for the
dexamethasone-treated primates and the three matched controls. During the
necropsies, specimens of S. stercoralis were recovered and tissue fragments were 
processed for histopathology.
RESULTS: The mean prepatency and patency periods were 16.1 ± 3.0 and 161.1 ± 72.2
DPI, respectively. The marmosets typically tolerated the infection well, but
immunosuppressed individuals exhibited higher numbers of larvae in the faeces and
progressive clinical deterioration with late disseminated infection. In these
cases, the number of females recovered was significantly higher than the number
of inoculated L3i. Large quantities of larvae were observed migrating through the
host tissues, and histopathology revealed pulmonary and intestinal injuries
consistent with those observed in human strongyloidiasis.
CONCLUSIONS: Both complicated and uncomplicated strongyloidiasis occur in C.
penicillata that is described as a susceptible small non-human primate model for 
S. stercoralis. This host permits the maintenance of a human strain of the
parasite in the laboratory and can be useful for experimental investigations of
strongyloidiasis. In parallel, we discuss data related to the autoinfective cycle
that provides new insights into the biology of S. stercoralis.

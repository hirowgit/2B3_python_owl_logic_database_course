disease.

The anti-parkinsonian and levodopa-sparing potential of the nociceptin/orphanin
FQ receptor (NOP) antagonist J-113397 has been demonstrated in rodent models of
Parkinson's disease. Here, we describe the levodopa-sparing potential of J-113397
in MPTP-lesioned marmosets. Coadministration of J-113397 (30 mg/kg) with a
sub-therapeutic dose of levodopa (12.5 mg/kg) produced an anti-parkinsonian
action equivalent to that of a therapeutic dose of levodopa. However, these
effects were accompanied by an equivalent level of dyskinesia. The actions of NOP
antagonists seen in rodents translate to nonhuman primates. However, the present 
study raises the possibility that these levodopa-sparing benefits may be offset
by a propensity to exacerbate dyskinesia.

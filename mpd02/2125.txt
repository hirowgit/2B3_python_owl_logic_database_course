Novel nonpeptide small molecule renin inhibitors bearing an N-isopropyl P(1)
motif were designed based on initial lead structures 1 and aliskiren (2).
(P(3)-P(1))-Benzamide derivatives such as 9a and 34, as well as the corresponding
P(1) basic tertiary amine derivatives 10 and 35 were found to display low
nanomolar inhibition against human renin in vitro.

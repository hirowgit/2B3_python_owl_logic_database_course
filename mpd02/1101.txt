The ovary of neonatal nonhuman primates contains the highest number of immature
oocytes, but its cryopreservation has not yet been sufficiently investigated in
all life stages. In the current study, we investigated cryodamage after
vitrification/warming of neonatal ovaries from a nonhuman primate, the common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). A Cryotop was used for cryopreservation of whole
ovaries. The morphology of the vitrified/warmed ovaries was found to be
equivalent to that of fresh ovaries. No significant difference in the number of
oocytes retaining normal morphology per unit area in histological sections was
found between the two groups. In an analysis of dispersed cells from the ovaries,
however, the cell viability of the vitrified/warmed group tended to be decreased.
The results of a comet assay showed no significant differences in DNA damage.
These results show that cryopreservation of neonatal marmoset ovaries using
vitrification may be useful as a storage system for whole ovaries.

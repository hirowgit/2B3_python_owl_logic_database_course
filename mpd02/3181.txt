Vaccine strains of measles virus (MV) use CD46 as receptor and downregulate CD46 
from the surface of infected cells. MVs isolated and passaged on B-lymphoid cells
(wild-type MVs) seem to use another receptor and do not downregulate CD46. In the
present study, we found that isolation of MV on human or marmoset B-lymphoid
cells did not alter the MV haemagglutinin (H) protein relative to that in the
patient. The wild-type isolates were adapted to the human epithelial HEp-2 cell
line or the monkey fibroblast Vero cell line. All HEp-2 cell adapted viruses and 
1 out of 4 Vero cell adapted viruses acquired the capacity to use CD46 as
receptor, as measured by their ability to infect murine cells expressing human
CD46. Adaptation to CD46 receptor usage was coupled to substitution of amino acid
481 of the MV H protein from asparagine to tyrosine but not to CD46
downregulation. The present study demonstrates that CD46 receptor usage can be
induced by adaptation of wild-type MV to cells that do not express a wild-type
receptor and suggests that a similar mechanism acted on the progenitor viruses of
the present MV vaccine strains during their isolation and attenuation.

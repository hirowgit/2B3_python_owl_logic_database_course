Changes in fatty acid composition of the cardiac phospholipids of the
cotton-eared marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) after feeding different lipid
supplements.

Charnock JS, McIntosh GH, Abeywardena MY, Russell GR.

After feeding marmosets different lipid supplements for 6 months, the
distribution of phospholipid classes and the fatty acid composition of
phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and
diphosphatidylglycerol (DPG) were determined in their cardiac membranes.
Supplementing the diet with linoleic-acid-rich sunflower seed oil raised the
level of 18:2,n-6 in both PC and PE, but did not change the level significantly
in DPG. When 18:2,n-6 was increased, the level of arachidonic acid (20:4,n-6) was
significantly decreased in PC and PE. No arachidonic acid was present in DPG.
Supplementing the diet with mutton fat did not markedly increase the level of
saturated fats, nor did it markedly reduce the level of arachidonic acid in any
phospholipid component. No dietary treatment altered the distribution of the
major phospholipid classes.

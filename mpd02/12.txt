Epilepsy has been extensively studied as a common neurological disease. Efforts
have been made on rodent and other animal models to reveal the pathogenic
mechanisms of epilepsy and develop new drugs for treatment. However, the features
of current epilepsy models cannot fully mimic different types of epilepsy in
humans, hence non-human primate models of epilepsy are required. The common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a New World monkey that is widely used to study 
brain function. Here, we present a natural marmoset model of generalized
epilepsy. In this unique marmoset family, generalized epilepsy was successfully
induced by handling operations in some individuals. We mapped the marmoset family
with handling-sensitive epilepsy and found that the epileptic phenotype can be
inherited. These marmosets were more sensitive to the epilepsy inducers
pentylenetetrazol. Using electrocorticogram (ECoG) recordings, we detected
epileptiform discharge in marmosets with a history of seizures. In summary, we
report a family of marmosets with generalized seizures induced by handling
operations. This epileptic marmoset family provides insights to better understand
the mechanism of generalized epilepsy and helps to develop new therapeutic
methods.

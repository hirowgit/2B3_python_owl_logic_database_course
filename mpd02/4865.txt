Characteristics of cell lines established from Epstein-Barr virus induced
marmoset tumors.

Neubauer RH, Rabin H, Hopkins RF 3rd, Levy BM.

The inoculation of a cotton-topped marmoset with B95-8 strain of EBV resulted in 
the induction of a multifocal lymphoma and lymphoblastoid cell lines were
established from liver, spleen and mesenteric lymph node tumors. The cell lines
were remarkably similar to each other with respect to the presence of EBV and its
expression, the surface properties of the cells and their stability, and the
functional products of the cells. Karyotypic examination of the cell lines
revealed the common loss of a single chromosome. The slight differences noted in 
karyotypes suggest some divergence from a tumor stem cell and imply a clonal
origin. Thus, EBV-induced lymphomas in cotton-topped marmosets resemble Burkitt's
lymphoma in man.

Prenatal maternal infections with Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) correlate with an
increased lifetime probability for the offspring to develop psychosis. We could
previously demonstrate that in human choroid plexus papilloma cells, anti-NG
antibodies (α-NG) bind to mitochondrial proteins HSP60 and ATPB, and interfere
with cellular energy metabolism. To assess the in vivo relevance for this,
especially during prenatal neural development, we investigated here interactions 
of NG-specific antisera (α-NG1, α-NG2) with brain, choroid plexus and other
non-neural tissues in pre- and perinatal samples of the nonhuman primate (NHP)
Callithrix jacchus (CJ), a NHP model for preclinical research. In histological
sections at embryonic day E75, immunohistochemistry revealed α-NG1 and
-2-staining in choroid plexus, ganglionic hill, optic cup, heart, and liver.
Within the cells, organelle-like structures were labeled, which could be
identified by immunohistochemical double-labeling as mitochondria. Both one- and 
two-dimensional Western blot analysis revealed tissue specific patterns of α-NG1 
immunoreactive bands and spots, respectively, which were subsequently
characterized by mass spectrometry. Thereby we could confirm the interactions of 
α-NG1 with human HSP60 and ATPB also in CJ choroid plexus and liver. Even more
important, in the CJ brain, several new targets, including NCAM1, CRMP2, and
SYT1, were identified, which by unrelated studies have been previously suggested 
to correlate with an increased schizophrenia risk. These findings support the
idea that the marmoset monkey is a useful NHP model to investigate the role of
maternal bacterial infections during prenatal brain development, and thereby
might improve the understanding of this important aspect of schizophrenia
pathology.

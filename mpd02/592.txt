Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disorder manifested via chronic
inflammation, demyelination, and neurodegeneration inside the central nervous
system. The progressive phase of MS is characterized by neurodegeneration, but
unlike classical neurodegenerative diseases, amyloid-like aggregation of
self-proteins has not been documented. There is evidence that citrullination
protects an immunodominant peptide of human myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein
(MOG34-56) against destructive processing in Epstein-Barr virus-infected
B-lymphocytes (EBV-BLCs) in marmosets and causes exacerbation of ongoing MS-like 
encephalopathies in mice. Here we collected evidence that citrullination of MOG
can also lead to amyloid-like behavior shifting the disease pathogenesis toward
neurodegeneration. We observed that an immunodominant MOG peptide, MOG35-55,
displays amyloid-like behavior upon site-specific citrullination at positions 41,
46, and/or 52. These amyloid aggregates are shown to be toxic to the EBV-BLCs and
to dendritic cells at concentrations favored for antigen presentation, suggesting
a role of amyloid-like aggregation in the pathogenesis of progressive MS.

Using a eukaryotic expression system in combination with a monoclonal antibody
(MAb) capable of blocking hepatitis A virus (HAV) adsorption, a cDNA clone was
selected from a library of S.la/Ve-1 cells, a cell line that is highly
susceptible to the virus. Sequence analysis of the cDNA revealed a single open
reading frame that encoded a protein consisting of 460 amino acids. The deduced
primary structure of the protein included a signal sequence, a transmembrane
domain, four sites for N-linked glycosylation, cysteine residues attributable to 
an immunoglobulin domain and threonine clusters characteristic of mucin-like
protein. By employing a vaccinia virus expression vector, the cDNA was expressed 
in HeLa cells where it induced marked HAV attachment which was specifically
blocked by the MAb. The cDNA obtained was thus assumed to encode a functional
receptor for HAV.

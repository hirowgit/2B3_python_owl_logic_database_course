Callitrichids in Brazil and the Guianas: current conservation status and
potential for biomedical research.

Mittermeier RA, Coimbra-Filho AF, van Roosmalen MG.

Brazilian and Guianan callitrichids are categorized as endangered, vulnerable,
common or status unknown. Endangered species should not be used in biomedical
research and a continuing supply of wild-caught vulnerable species is also out of
the question. Common species, on the other hand, could withstand limited
sustained yield cropping without difficulty. Species categorized as status
unknown should not be used until more data on them become available.
Callitrichids have a higher reproductive potential than other New World monkeys, 
are for the most part quite adaptable, and are rarely hunted for food or captured
as pets locally. Widespread habitat destruction is the major threat to their
survival and species with naturally small ranges in areas of high human activity 
(e.g. Leontopithecus, Callithrix flaviceps) are in the greatest danger.

PURPOSE: The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a New World primate of
increasing interest to neuroscience and in translational brain research. The
present work describes the design and implementation of individualized 8-channel 
receive-only radiofrequency (RF) coil arrays that provide whole-brain coverage
and allow anatomical and functional MRI experiments in conscious, awake
marmosets.
METHODS: The coil arrays were designed with their elements embedded inside
individualized restraint helmets. The size, geometry, and arrangement of the coil
elements were optimized to allow whole-brain coverage. Coil-to-coil decoupling
was achieved by a combination of geometric decoupling and low input impedance
preamplifiers. The performance of the embedded arrays was compared against that
of one 8-channel receive-only array built to fit the external surface of the
helmets.
RESULTS: Three individualized helmets with embedded coil arrays were built for
three marmosets. Whole-brain coverage was achieved with high sensitivity
extending over the entire cortex. Visual stimulation of conscious awake marmosets
elicited robust BOLD fMRI responses in both primary and higher order visual areas
of the occipitotemporal cortex.
CONCLUSION: The high sensitivity provided by embedded receive-only coil arrays
allows both anatomical and functional MRI data to be obtained with high spatial
resolution in conscious, awake marmosets. Magn Reson Med 78:387-398, 2017. © 2016

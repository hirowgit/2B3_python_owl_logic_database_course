The number of studies that use the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) in
various fields of neurosciences is increasing dramatically. In general, animals
enter the study when their health status is considered satisfactory on the basis 
of classical clinical investigations. In behavioral studies, variations of score 
between individuals are frequently observed, some of them being considered as
poor performers or outliers. Experimenters rarely consider the fact that it could
be related to some brain anomaly. This raises the important issue of the
reliability of such classical behavioral approaches without using complementary
imaging, especially in animals lacking striking external clinical signs. Here we 
report the case of a young marmoset which presented a set of cognitive
impairments in two different tasks compared to other age-matched animals. Brain
imaging revealed a patent right lateral ventricular enlargement with a mild
hippocampal atrophy. This abnormality could explain the cognitive impairments of 
this animal. Such a case points to the importance of complementing behavioral
studies by imaging explorations to avoid experimental bias.

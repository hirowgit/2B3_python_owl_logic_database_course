The use of enzyme immunoassays (EIA) for the non-invasive measurement of
glucocorticoids provides a valuable tool for monitoring health and welfare in
sensitive species. We validated methods for measuring fecal glucocorticoid
metabolites (FGM) using the response to veterinary exams for four species of
callitrichine monkeys: golden lion tamarin (Leontopithecus rosalia, n = 7),
callimico (Callimico goeldii, n = 2), pied tamarin (Saguinus bicolor, n = 2), and
white-fronted marmoset (Callithrix geoffroyi, n = 2). Routine veterinary exams
were performed for the golden lion tamarins and callimicos, but exams for the
pied tamarins and white-fronted marmosets were prompted by the death of a social 
partner. Prior to veterinary exams, fecal markers were evaluated to allow
collection of individual samples and estimate approximate gut transit times.
Based on this assessment, individual markers were fed in the afternoon, and fresh
morning fecal samples were collected throughout this study. Following a
veterinary exam, FGM increased roughly 3- to 28-fold above baseline in all
species. Although FGM for most species returned to baseline concentrations within
24-48 h, the marmosets exhibited a progressive increase in FGM after an exam in
response to the death of a breeding female and subsequent hand-rearing of a
neonate. Individual differences were noted in the callimicos and tamarins, with
higher baseline FGM levels in females vs. males, although small sample size
precluded a clear determination of sex differences. To our knowledge, this is the
first study to measure FGM in callimicos and white-fronted marmosets and the
first to compare FGM across callitrichine species. These findings highlight the
broad applicability of this EIA to measure the stress response of callitrichine
monkeys. The progressive increase in FGM in the marmosets during hand-rearing of 
a neonate suggests that care should be taken to minimize this disturbance as much
as possible.

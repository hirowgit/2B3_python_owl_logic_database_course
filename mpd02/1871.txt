Prolonged exposure to an effective stimulus generally reduces the sensitivity of 
neurons early in the visual pathway. Yet eye and head movements bring about
frequent changes in the retinal image, and it is less clear that exposure to
brief presentations will produce similar desensitization. To address this, we
made extracellular recordings from single neurons in the lateral geniculate
nucleus of anesthetized marmosets, a New World primate. We measured the contrast 
response for drifting gratings before and after 0.5-s exposure to a high-contrast
drifting grating, a stationary grating, or a blank screen. Prior exposure to the 
drifting grating reduced the contrast sensitivity of cells in the magnocellular
pathway, on average by 23%; this reduction remained strong when the adapting and 
test stimuli were separated by 0.4 s. Exposure to a stationary grating of the
preferred spatial phase did not change the contrast response; exposure to the
opposite spatial phase did. None of the brief adaptors reduced the sensitivity of
parvocellular cells. We conclude that brief periods of high contrast, such as
those that would be expected to occur during a normal visual fixation, are
sufficient to reduce the sensitivity of magnocellular-pathway cells.

Information on the organization of the spermatogenic cycle of the common marmoset
(Call√≠thrix jacchus), a small New World primate, is limited to a single
histological report on the differentiation of spermatids. In the present study we
have used non-radioactive in-situ hybridization with a cRNA probe directed
against marmoset protamine 2, on fixed sections of marmoset and human testis to
elucidate the organization of mature germ cells within the seminiferous
epithelium. Specificity of the probe was checked on Northern blots; mP2
hybridized exclusively to mRNA in samples extracted from marmoset and human
testis. In sections from human and marmoset testis, positive staining for mRNA
was confined to round and elongating spermatids and in the human was reduced in
samples from patients with incomplete spermatogenesis. In the human, P2 mRNA was 
present in groups of cells consistent with the presence of more than one stage of
the spermatogenic cycle in transverse sections of individual tubules. In the
marmoset, P2-positive cells were detected as a continuous ring of staining in the
majority of sections of tubules whilst in others only a group(s) of cells was
positive. We conclude that the arrangement of the spermatogenic wave in this New 
World primate may be intermediate between that seen in rodents (segmental) and in
the human (helical).

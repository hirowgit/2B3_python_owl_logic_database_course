Concerns have been raised about pet monkeys as a potential threat to humans. We
report the opposite situation, a danger to pets that arises from humans. Similar 
to herpesvirus B (Cercopithecine herpesvirus 1), which endangers humans but not
its host species, Human herpesvirus 1 can act as a "killer virus" when crossing
the species barrier to New World monkeys.

The intron 4 sequences of the three polymorphic alleles at the X-linked color
photo-pigment locus in the squirrel monkey and the marmoset reveal that the
alleles in each species are exceptionally divergent. The data further suggest
either that each triallelic system has arisen independently in these two New
World monkey lineages, or that in each species at least seven deletions and
insertions (14 in the two species) in intron 4 have been transferred and
homogenized among the alleles by gene conversion or recombination. In either
case, the alleles in each species apparently have persisted more than 5 million
years and probably have been maintained by overdominant selection.

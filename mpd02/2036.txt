Although the adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector is a promising tool for gene
transfer into neurons, especially for therapeutic purposes, neurotropism in
primate brains is not fully elucidated for specific AAV serotypes. Here, we
injected AAV serotype 8 (AAV8) vector carrying the enhanced green fluorescent
protein (EGFP) gene under a ubiquitous promoter into the cerebral cortex,
striatum and substantia nigra of common marmosets. Robust neuronal EGFP
expression was observed at all injected sites. Cell typing with
immunohistochemistry confirmed efficient AAV8-mediated gene transfer into the
pyramidal neurons in the cortex, calbindin-positive medium spiny neurons in the
striatum and dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. The results indicate a
preferential tropism of AAV8 for subsets of neurons, but not for glia, in monkey 
brains.

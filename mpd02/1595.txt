Metabolic assessment of a non-human primate model of metabolic syndrome and
obesity requires the necessary biomarkers specific to the species. While the
rhesus monkey has a number of specific assays for assessing metabolic syndrome,
the marmoset does not. Furthermore, the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) has 
a small blood volume that necessitates using a single blood volume for multiple
analyses. The common marmoset holds a great potential as an alternative primate
model for the study of human disease but assay methods need to be developed and
validated for the biomarkers of metabolic syndrome. Here we report on the
adaptation, development, and validation of commercially available immunoassays
for common marmoset samples in small volumes. We have performed biological
validations for insulin, adiponectin, leptin, and ghrelin to demonstrate the use 
of these biomarkers in examining metabolic syndrome and other related diseases in
the common marmoset.

Demonstration of ocular dominance columns in a New World primate by means of
monocular deprivation.

DeBruyn EJ, Casagrande VA.

We investigated the pattern transneuronally transported [3H]proline to the visual
cortex of normal and deprived marmosets (Callithrix jacchus). In the normal
marmoset a continuous band of label was evident within layer IV of striate
cortex. Following injection of the closed eye of deprived marmosets, distinct
fluctuations of label were apparent over the base of layer IV in both
hemispheres. These results support the hypothesis that the presence of ocular
separation of geniculo-striate afferents is a feature common to all primates.

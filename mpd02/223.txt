ABH antigens are histo-antigens, but were first described on the surface of human
erythrocytes. They are found in those cells only in great apes and humans, while 
in more primitive animals they are found in tissues and body fluids. ABH antigens
are mainly distributed in tissues that are in contact with the external
environment and may serve as ligands for pathogens in tissues or block their
connection. Description of the distribution of these molecules in non-human
primate tissues is restricted to a few tissues and species. This paper describes 
the expression of human A, B and H type antigens in different organs from four
species of New World Primates, obtained from the Centro Nacional de Primatas, as 
well as comparing that expression with what has been described for humans. In
this study, although the tissue description of the antigens is similar to the
genetic model for humans, some differences in expression between some organs from
those species and those of humans were found. The differences occurred mainly in 
endodermal organs that have secretory functions and are probably under the
control of the human-type FUT-2 enzyme. In the mesodermal-origin organs there was
a reduction or absence of A and B antigen marking, particularly in the H
precursor substance, indicating that those organs are under the control of the
human-type FUT-1 enzyme. These findings have demonstrated that there is similar
ABH antigen reactivity in tissue distribution between the species, although there
are some species-specific cases.

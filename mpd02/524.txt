In November 2015, an 83-d-old juvenile male common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) 
in good body condition was found dead in his family cage with no previous
premonitory signs. Necropsy revealed a gas-distended abdomen, feces-distended
large bowel, and a full-thickness distal colonic perforation resulting in fecal
peritonitis. The distal colon ended in a blind pouch at 7 mm prior to the
expected anal opening, consistent with atresia ani. Here we present this case,
briefly discuss the human and veterinary literature regarding correction of
anorectal malformations, and highlight the importance of identifying such
devastating congenital defects in breeding colonies while limiting the disruption
and handling of seemingly healthy, young NHP raised in a complex social setting.

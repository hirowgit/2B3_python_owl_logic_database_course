Direct inoculation of marmoset livers with an in vitro transcription mixture
containing cDNA and full-length genomic RNA transcripts of hepatitis A virus
resulted in acute viral hepatitis. Elevations in serum levels of liver enzymes
were correlated with appearance of antibody to hepatitis A virus. Genomes of
infectious hepatitis A virus isolated from the feces of transfected marmosets
contained the same mutation as the cDNA template used for transfection. Liver
biopsies confirmed that the virus encoded by the cDNA clone induced
histopathological changes equivalent to those caused by virulent wild-type virus.

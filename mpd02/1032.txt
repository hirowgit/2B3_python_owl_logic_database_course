Herpesvirus saimiri, an oncogenic herpesvirus, during latency produces seven
small nuclear RNAs, called the Herpesvirus saimiri U RNAs (HSUR1-7). HSUR1
mediates degradation of the host microRNA, miR-27, via a process that requires
imperfect base-pairing. The decreased levels of miR-27 lead to prolonged T-cell
activation and likely contribute to oncogenesis. To gain insight into
HSUR1-mediated degradation of miR-27, we probed the in vivo secondary structure
of HSUR1 and coupled this with bioinformatic structural analyses. The results
suggest that HSUR1 adopts a conformation different than previously believed and
that the region complementary to miR-27 lacks stable structure. To determine
whether HSUR1 structural flexibility is important for its ability to mediate
miR-27 degradation, we performed structurally informative mutagenic analyses of
HSUR1. HSUR1 mutants in which the miR-27 binding site sequence is preserved, but 
sequestered in predicted helices, lose their ability to decrease miR-27 levels.
These results indicate that the HSUR1 miR27-binding region must be available in a
conformationally flexible segment for noncoding RNA function.

A G-band karyotypic analysis was carried out in individual species groups of
three Callitrichid primate genera: Cebuella, Callithrix, and Leontopithecus.
Within Callithrix, the karyotypes of the morphologically distinct and
geographically isolated morphotypes C. jacchus jacchus and C. jacchus penicillata
were identical. Within the lion tamarin genus, Leontopithecus, the karyotypes of 
the three morphotypes (L. rosalia rosalia, L. rosalia chrysomelas and L. rosalia 
chrysopygus) were also indistinguishable from one another. These results are
consistent with the taxonomic designation of subspecies rank to the different
morphotypes. A comparison of type specimens among the three Callitrichid genera
showed that their phyletic radiation has been paralleled by a limited number of
chromosome rearrangements and a relatively high amount of karyotypic invariance. 
A fusion/fission event has been postulated to account for the difference in
diploid number between Cebuella (2n = 44) and the other species (2n = 46). The
karyotype of Callithrix jacchus was found to be more directly derived from
Cebuella than was that of Leontopithecus. These findings differ from the previous
proposition that Leontopithecus might have diverged from a common Callitrichid
ancestor before the emergence of the genus Callithrix.

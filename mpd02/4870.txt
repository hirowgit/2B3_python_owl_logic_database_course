Aggression and flight behaviour of the marmoset monkey Callithrix jacchus: an
ethogram for brain stimulation studies.

Lipp HP.

The aggressive and flight behaviour of the common marmoset monkey (Callithrix
jacchus) is described and split into behavioural units, allowing analysis of
agonistic behaviour evoked by electrical stimulation of the hypothalamus. The
social context of the described units is also considered. C. jacchus shows
clearly recognizable behavioural patterns. Free-born animals are very timid and
show typical flight reactions. Within aggressive behaviour, two types of
aggression can be distinguished: very violent attacks causing severe injuries,
often accompanied by particular threat displays and observed during dominance and
territorial encounters, and, on the other hand, relatively harmless short
attacks, together with a noisy vocalization, for defensive purposes or keeping
group members at a distance.

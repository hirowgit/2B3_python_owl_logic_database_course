Surgery in humans is continuously evolving and promoted minimally invasive
treatment. On the other hand, despite the importance of the 3Rs principles for
experimental animals is well documented, no reports describe specific
methodologies for implementing "refinement" in practice. Here, we describe a new 
technique, the "Ohta Method" for caudal arthrocentesis in the pursuit of the 3Rs 
for animal experiments and the development of innovative methods for
investigating systemic organ arteries through minimally invasive procedures. This
procedure requires only a percutaneous puncture of the caudal artery without any 
injury to the limb or body trunk. In addition, it does not cut down the artery,
making hemostasis easier and recovering arterial damage easier. We will show
multiple organ artery angiographies in marmoset for the first time in the world. 
The principle described in this paper could also be applied to many other small
animals, such as rats. Moreover, using this method, multiple doses of the drug or
cells can be administered to the target organ at the time of therapeutic
intervention, thereby enabling the establishment of more sophisticated and
complex therapeutic intervention studies as translational research.

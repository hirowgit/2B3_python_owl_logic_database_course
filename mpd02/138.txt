Blunted reward responsivity is associated with anhedonia in humans and is a core 
feature of depression. This protocol describes how to train the common marmoset, 
Callithrix jacchus, on an appetitive Pavlovian conditioning paradigm to measure
behavioral and cardiovascular correlates of anticipatory and consummatory phases 
of reward processing. We describe how to use intracerebral infusions to
manipulate brain regions whose activity is relevant to impaired reward processing
in depression and how the paradigm can be used to test antidepressant efficacy.
For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to

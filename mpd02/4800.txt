Perseverative behaviour after amphetamine; dissociation of response tendency from
reward association.

Ridley RM, Baker HF, Haystead TA.

Low doses of amphetamine were found to alter the ability of marmosets to take
account of changes in reward values of object stimuli in a visual discrimination 
task. Under amphetamine, animals changed their motor responses and stimulus
choice in order to preserve the acquired reward value or meaning of certain
stimuli. These results suggest that the perseverative effect of amphetamine on
behaviour is due to impaired cognitive flexibility rather than to an enhancement 
of motor habit.

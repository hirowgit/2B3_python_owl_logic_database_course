Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in the common marmoset, a
small-bodied Neotropical primate, is a well-known and validated animal model for 
multiple sclerosis (MS). This model can be used for exploratory research, i.e.,
investigating the pathogenic mechanisms involved in MS, and applied research,
testing the efficacy of new potential drugs.In this chapter, we will describe a
method to induce EAE in the marmoset. In addition, we will explain the most
common immunological techniques involved in the marmoset EAE research, namely
isolation of mononuclear cells (MNC) from peripheral blood and lymphoid tissue,
assaying T cell proliferation by thymidine incorporation, MNC phenotyping by flow
cytometry, antibody measurement by ELISA, generation of B cell lines and
antigen-specific T cell lines, and assaying cytotoxic T cells.

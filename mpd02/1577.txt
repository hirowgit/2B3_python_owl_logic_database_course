MRI at high field can be sensitized to the magnetic properties of tissues, which 
introduces a signal dependence on the orientation of white matter (WM) fiber
bundles relative to the magnetic field. In addition, study of the NMR relaxation 
properties of this signal has indicated contributions from compartmentalized
water environments inside and outside the myelin sheath that may be separable.
Here we further investigated the effects of water compartmentalization on the MRI
signal with the goal of extracting compartment-specific information. By comparing
MRI measurements of human and marmoset brain at 7T with magnetic field modeling, 
we show that: (1) water between the myelin lipid bilayers, in the axonal, and in 
the interstitial space each experience characteristic magnetic field effects that
depend on fiber orientation (2) these field effects result in characteristic
relaxation properties and frequency shifts for these compartments; and (3)
compartmental contributions may be separated by multi-component fitting of the
MRI signal relaxation (i.e. decay) curve. We further show the potential
application of these findings to the direct mapping of myelin content and
assessment of WM fiber integrity with high field MRI.

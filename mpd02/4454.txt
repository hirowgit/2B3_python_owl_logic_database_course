The pars externa (PE) system of the anterior olfactory nucleus (AON) in a
primate, Callithrix jacchus, was defined by its architecture and by its
connection patterns with the main olfactory bulb (MOB) as revealed by tracing
techniques. Focal, unilateral injections of wheat germ agglutinin-conjugated
horseradish peroxidase into the MOB yielded ipsilaterally labelled afferent
neurons in all subdivisions of the AON, with the exception of a clearly
circumscribed area in the ventrolateral retrobulbar field of the basocaudal
frontal lobe; in the contralateral hemisphere, this same area contained intensely
stained neurons forming a horizontal flat plate of small neurons. This unique
commissural connection pattern parallels the organization of the PE to MOB
connection in sub-primates (Schoenfeld and Macrides, 1984, J. Comp. Neurol., 227:
121-135). Thus, despite earlier controversy (Crosby and Humphrey, 1939, J. Comp. 
Neurol., 71: 121-213), there appears to be a PE system in a microsmatic primate
whose organization is quite similar to that in sub-primates.

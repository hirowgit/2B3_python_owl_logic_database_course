The utility of the habituation-dishabituation procedure was examined in the
common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) and the owl monkeys (Aotus spp.). The same 
movies were repeatedly shown to monkeys during an habituation phase, followed by 
a test phase during which monkeys were presented with a different movie. The time
monkeys spent looking at the movie gradually decreased during the habituation
phase and then significantly increased when they were presented the new movie.
The limited findings indicate that these monkeys were sensitive to the
habituation-dishabituation paradigm, suggesting that this procedure might be used
to assess cognition and perception.

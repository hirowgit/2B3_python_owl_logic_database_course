In vitro cytotoxicity is an important virulence property of motile mesophilic
Aeromonas species. Cell-free supernatant prepared from 55 Aeromonas isolates
including one A. hydrophila type strain (MTCC 646) were examined for their
cytotoxic potential on four different cell lines (Vero, BHK-21, MDBK, B 95a).
Results of the study revealed cytotoxic potential in 92.72% of the isolates.
Analysis of data exposed significant variation among isolates in respect of their
cytotoxicity. Vero cells proved to be most sensitive to aeromonal toxins and B
95a cells showed significantly (P<0.01) lower response compared to other cell
lines. Sensitivities of BHK-21 and MDBK cell lines were in between Vero and B
95a.

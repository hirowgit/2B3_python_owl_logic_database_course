The fatty acid composition of marmoset monkey perirenal fat was examined after
long-term feeding of different lipid supplemented diets. Saturated fatty acid
supplementation significantly reduced linoleic acid; n-6 polyunsaturated fatty
acid (PUFA) supplementation decreased oleic acid but did not reduce the saturated
fatty acid content of perirenal fat. Dietary supplementation with fish oil also
reduced the level of linoleic acid but increased the level of palmitic acid as
well as that of the long-chain n-3 PUFAs. Perirenal fat levels of linoleic acid
and docosahexaenoic acid are reliable measures of n-6 and n-3 PUFA intake
respectively, but the levels of saturated fatty acids palmitic and stearic do not
accurately reflect the marmosets dietary intake.

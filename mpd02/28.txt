We provide here a current overview of marmoset (Callithrix) evolution,
hybridization, species biology, basic/biomedical research, and conservation
initiatives. Composed of 2 subgroups, the aurita group (C aurita and C flaviceps)
and the jacchus group (C geoffroyi, C jacchus, C kuhlii, and C penicillata), this
relatively young primate radiation is endemic to the Brazilian Cerrado, Caatinga,
and Atlantic Forest biomes. Significant impacts on Callithrix within these biomes
resulting from anthropogenic activity include (1) population declines,
particularly for the aurita group; (2) widespread geographic displacement,
biological invasions, and range expansions of C jacchus and C penicillata; (3)
anthropogenic hybridization; and (4) epizootic Yellow Fever and Zika viral
outbreaks. A number of Brazilian legal and conservation initiatives are now in
place to protect the threatened aurita group and increase research about them.
Due to their small size and rapid life history, marmosets are prized biomedical
models. As a result, there are increasingly sophisticated genomic Callithrix
resources available and burgeoning marmoset functional, immuno-, and epigenomic
research. In both the laboratory and the wild, marmosets have given us insight
into cognition, social group dynamics, human disease, and pregnancy. Callithrix
jacchus and C penicillata are emerging neotropical primate models for arbovirus
disease, including Dengue and Zika. Wild marmoset populations are helping us
understand sylvatic transmission and human spillover of Zika and Yellow Fever
viruses. All of these factors are positioning marmosets as preeminent models to
facilitate understanding of facets of evolution, hybridization, conservation,
human disease, and emerging infectious diseases.

Experimental animals including the ferret, marmoset, woodchuck, mini pig, and
tree shrew have been used in biomedical research. However, their gut microbiota
have not been fully investigated. In this study, the gut microbiota of these five
experimental animals were analyzed with 16S rRNA sequencing. The phyla
Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Fusobacteria were present in the gut microbiota of
all the species. Specific phyla were present in different animals: Proteobacteria
in the ferret, Tenericutes in the marmoset, and Spirochaetes in the mini pig.
Fusobacterium and unidentified Clostridiales were the dominant genera in the
ferret, whereas Libanicoccus, Lactobacillus, Porphyromonas, and Peptoclostridium 
were specific to marmoset, mini pig, woodchuck, and tree shrew, respectively. A
clustering analysis showed that the overall distribution of microbial species in 
the guts of these species mirrored their mammalian phylogeny, and the microbiota 
of the marmoset and tree shrew showed the closest bray_curtis distances to that
of humans. PICRUSt functional prediction separated the woodchuck from the other
species, which may reflect its herbivorous diet. In conclusion, both the
evolutionary phylogeny and daily diet affect the gut microbiota of these
experimental animals, which should not be neglected for their usage in biomedical
research.

Experimental primate embryology has been hampered by limited access to embryos.
In addition to surgical techniques, the less stressful non-surgical technique of 
uterine flushing has been developed but has had only limitedly used in recovering
pre-implantation embryos from marmoset monkeys. In this study, we introduce the
use of ultrasonography during marmoset non-surgical uterine flushing to make the 
cannulation easier, to further reduce stress, and to ensure thorough uterine
flushing. We were able to cannulate in 99% of the transcervical cannulation
attempts, repeat the flushing up to 17 times with the same animal, and recover up
to 90% of the ovulation products. We also found that 8-cell or earlier stage
embryos could be frequently obtained by non-surgical uterine flushing at 4 or 5
days after ovulation. The easiness and effectiveness of this novel
ultrasound-guided technique will enable more research groups to study marmoset
embryology and facilitate progress in this field.

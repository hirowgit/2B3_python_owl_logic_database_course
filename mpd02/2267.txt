Signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM) expression was inhibited in B95a 
cell line using siRNA and the effect of SLAM inhibition on peste des petits
ruminants virus (PPRV) replication and infectivity titre was studied. SLAM
suppression was assessed using real-time PCR and flow cytometry to confirm
suppression at the m-RNA and protein levels, respectively. Three chemically
synthesized siRNAs were transfected individually using oligofectamine into B95a
cell line. This resulted in SLAM suppression from 48 to 454-folds, in comparison 
to the untransfected B95a cell line. When the SLAM suppressed B95a cell line was 
infected with PPRV, replication was reduced by 12-143-folds and virus titre was
reduced from log10 1.09 to 2.28. siRNA 3 showed the most potent inhibition of
SLAM expression both at m-RNA and protein levels. This also caused the maximum
reduction of virus replication and virus titre. A 100-fold reduction in PPRV
titres was seen in anti-SLAM antibody neutralized B95a cell line. This further
confirms that SLAM is one of the (co) receptors for PPRV. However, the presence
of other putative virus receptor(s) is/are not ruled out.

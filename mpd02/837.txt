As the optogenetic field expands, the need for precise targeting of neocortical
circuits only grows more crucial. This work demonstrates a technique for using
SolidworksÂ® computer-aided design (CAD) and readily available stereotactic brain 
atlases to create a three-dimensional (3-D) model of the dorsal region of area
visual cortex 4 (V4D) of the macaque monkey (Macaca fascicularis) visual cortex. 
The 3-D CAD model of the brain was used to customize an [Formula: see text] Utah 
optrode array (UOA) after it was determined that a high-density ([Formula: see
text]) UOA caused extensive damage to marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) primary
visual cortex as assessed by electrophysiological recording of spiking activity
through a 1.5-mm-diameter through glass via. The [Formula: see text] UOA was
customized for optrode length ([Formula: see text]), optrode width ([Formula: see
text]), optrode pitch ([Formula: see text]), backplane thickness ([Formula: see
text]), and overall form factor ([Formula: see text]). Two [Formula: see text]
UOAs were inserted into layer VI of macaque V4D cortices with minimal damage as
assessed in fixed tissue cytochrome oxidase staining in nonrecoverable surgeries.
Additionally, two [Formula: see text] arrays were implanted in mice (Mus
musculus) motor cortices, providing early evidence for long-term tolerability
(over 6 months), and for the ability to integrate the UOA with a Holobundle light
delivery system toward patterned optogenetic stimulation of cortical networks.

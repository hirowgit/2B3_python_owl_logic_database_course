1. Pharmacokinetics of human cytochrome P450 probes (caffeine, racemic warfarin, 
omeprazole, metoprolol and midazolam) composite, after single intravenous and
oral administrations at doses of 0.20 and 1.0 mg kg(-1), respectively, to four
male common marmosets were investigated. 2. The plasma concentrations of caffeine
and warfarin decreased slowly in a monophasic manner but those of omeprazole,
metoprolol and midazolam decreased extensively after intravenous and oral
administrations, in a manner that approximated those as reported for
pharmacokinetics in humans. 3. Bioavailabilities were ∼100% for caffeine and
warfarin, but <25% for omeprazole and metoprolol. Bioavailability of midazolam
was 4% in marmosets, presumably because of contribution of marmoset P450 3A4
expressed in small intestine and liver, with a high catalytic efficiency for
midazolam 1'-hydroxylation as evident in the recombinant system. 4. These results
suggest that common marmosets, despite their rapid clearance of some human P450
probe substrates, could be an experimental model for humans and that marmoset
P450s have functional characteristics that differ from those of human and/or
cynomolgus monkey P450s in some aspects, indicating their importance in modeling 
in P450-dependent drug metabolism studies in marmosets and of further studies.

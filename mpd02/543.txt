The gut microbiome is known to play a significant role in human health but its
role in aging remains unclear. The objective of this study was to compare the gut
microbiome composition between young adult and geriatric non-human primates
(marmosets) as a model of human health and disease. Stool samples were collected 
from geriatric (8+ years) and young adult males (2-5 years). Stool 16S ribosomal 
RNA V4 sequences were amplified and sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq platform.
Sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units and classified via
Mothur's Bayesian classifier referenced against the Greengenes database. A total 
of 10 young adult and 10 geriatric marmosets were included. Geriatric marmosets
had a lower mean Shannon diversity compared with young marmosets (3.15 vs. 3.46; 
p = 0.0191). Geriatric marmosets had a significantly higher mean abundance of
Proteobacteria (0.22 vs. 0.09; p = 0.0233) and lower abundance of Firmicutes
(0.15 vs. 0.19; p = 0.0032) compared with young marmosets. Geriatric marmosets
had a significantly higher abundance of Succinivibrionaceae (0.16 vs. 0.01;
p = 0.0191) and lower abundance of Porphyromonadaceae (0.07 vs. 0.11;
p = 0.0494). In summary, geriatric marmosets had significantly altered microbiome
diversity and composition compared with young adult marmosets. Further studies
are needed to test microbiome-targeted therapies to improve healthspan and
lifespan.

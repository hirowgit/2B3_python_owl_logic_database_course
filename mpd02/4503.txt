Linear and angular measurements of young marmosets taken at three-month intervals
from a series of cephalograms are presented. They show that linear craniofacial
development was largely complete by six months of age, subsequent angular changes
being mainly related to dental development. No sexual dimorphism was apparent,
and there was substantial homogeneity in results for animals of the same age.
Thus, marmosets, with their low cost, ease of handling, and rapid maturation, may
provide a useful animal model for craniofacial research.

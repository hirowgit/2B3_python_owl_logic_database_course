The common marmoset, Callithrix jacchus, is a small New World monkey that has
recently gained attention as an important experimental animal model in the field 
of neuroscience as well in rehabilitative and regenerative medicine. This
attention reflects the closer phylogenetic relationship between humans and common
marmosets compared to that between humans and other experimental animals. When
studying the neuronal mechanism behind various types of neurological motor
disorders using the common marmoset, possible differences in muscle parameters
(e.g., the force-generating capacity of each of the muscles) between the common
marmoset and other animals must be taken into account to permit accurate
interpretation of observed motor behavior. Differences in the muscle
architectural properties are expected to affect biomechanics, and hence to affect
neuronal control of body movements. Therefore, we dissected the forelimbs and
hind limbs of two common marmosets, including systematic analysis of the muscle
mass, fascicle length, and physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA). Comparisons
of the mass fractions and PCSA fractions of the forelimb and hind limb
musculature among the common marmoset, human, Japanese macaque, and domestic cat 
demonstrated that the overall muscle architectural properties of the forelimbs
and hind limbs in the common marmoset are very similar to those of the Japanese
macaque, a typical quadrupedal primate. However, muscle architectural properties 
of the common marmoset differ from those of the domestic cat, which has
relatively larger hamstrings and pedal digital flexor muscles. Compared to
humans, the common marmoset exhibits relatively smaller shoulder protractor,
retractor, and abductor muscles and larger elbow extensor and rotator-cuff
muscles in the forelimb, and smaller plantarflexor muscles in the hind limb.
These differences in the muscle architectural properties must be taken into
account when interpreting motor behaviors such as locomotion and arm-reaching
movements in the common marmoset.

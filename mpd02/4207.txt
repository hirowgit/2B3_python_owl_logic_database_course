The accumulation of lipofuscin, an important phenomenon during aging, suggests
that the sexual maturity (puberty) of mammals is a starting point of the aging
process. The rate of cardiac lipofuscin accumulation was not correlated linearly 
with maximum life span of mammals, but the correlation was a power function of
the maximum life span. The rate of lipofuscin accumulation statistically
correlated with the specific metabolic rate, and inversely correlated with the
brain weight of mammals. The first appearance of lipofuscin showed a good
correlation with the brain weight. However, the slope of the line was different
between primates and domestic and laboratory animals. From these results, it is
suggested that the accumulation of cardiac lipofuscin is dependent on the
specific metabolic rate of mammals.

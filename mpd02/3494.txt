Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infects both B lymphocytes and squamous epithelial cells
in vitro, but the cell type(s) required to establish primary and persistent
infection in vivo has not been definitively elucidated. The aim of this study was
to investigate a group of individuals who lack mature B lymphocytes due to the
rare heritable disorder X-linked agammaglobulinemia in order to determine the
role of the B cell in the infection process. The results show that none of these 
individuals harbored EBV in their blood or throat washings. Furthermore, no
EBV-specific memory cytotoxic T lymphocytes were found, suggesting that they had 
not undergone infection in the past. In contrast, 50% of individuals were found
to carry human herpesvirus 6, showing that they are infectible by another
lymphotropic herpesvirus. These results add weight to the theory that B
lymphocytes, and not oropharyngeal epithelial cells, may be required for primary 
infection with EBV.

Disorders of dysregulated negative emotion such as depression and anxiety also
feature increased cardiovascular mortality and decreased heart-rate variability
(HRV). These disorders are correlated with dysfunction within areas 25 and 32 of 
the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), but a causal relationship between
dysregulation of these areas and such symptoms has not been demonstrated.
Furthermore, cross-species translation is limited by inconsistent findings
between rodent fear extinction and human neuroimaging studies of negative
emotion. To reconcile these literatures, we applied an investigative approach to 
the brain-body interactions at the core of negative emotional dysregulation. We
show that, in marmoset monkeys (a nonhuman primate that has far greater vmPFC
homology to humans than rodents), areas 25 and 32 have causal yet opposing roles 
in regulating the cardiovascular and behavioral correlates of negative emotion.
In novel Pavlovian fear conditioning and extinction paradigms, pharmacological
inactivation of area 25 decreased the autonomic and behavioral correlates of
negative emotion expectation, whereas inactivation of area 32 increased them via 
generalization. Area 25 inactivation also increased resting HRV. These findings
are inconsistent with current theories of rodent/primate prefrontal functional
similarity, and provide insight into the role of these brain regions in affective
disorders. They demonstrate that area 32 hypoactivity causes behavioral
generalization relevant to anxiety, and that area 25 is a causal node governing
the emotional and cardiovascular symptomatology relevant to anxiety and
depression.

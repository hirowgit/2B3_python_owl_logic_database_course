Common marmosets were given a subcutaneous injection of MPTP (1.25-2.5 mg/kg
twice a week) for 5 or 10 consecutive months and were sacrificed after a survival
time of 6 months or 15 days, respectively. The parkinsonian symptoms were not
very marked at the time of sacrifice but there was a strong decrease of dopamine 
and, to a lesser extent, of its metabolites in the striatum and in some
extrastriatal regions. There was also a profound loss of serotonin in the
striatum and in all of the extrastriatal regions analyzed, which was still highly
significant 6 months after discontinuation of MPTP treatment. The results suggest
that the selected dosage schedule produces a widespread and lasting neuronal
degeneration closely resembling the neurochemical pathology of Parkinson's
disease.

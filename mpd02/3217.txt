Mature T cells initially respond to Ag by activation and expansion, but high and 
repeated doses of Ag cause programmed cell death and can suppress T cell-mediated
diseases in rodents. We evaluated repeated systemic Ag administration in a
marmoset model of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis that closely resembles 
the human disease multiple sclerosis. We found that treatment with MP4, a
chimeric, recombinant polypeptide containing human myelin basic protein and human
proteolipid protein epitopes, prevented clinical symptoms and did not exacerbate 
disease. CNS lesions were also reduced as assessed in vivo by magnetic resonance 
imaging. Thus, specific Ag-directed therapy can be effective and nontoxic in
primates.

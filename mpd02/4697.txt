A comparison of tooth eruption patterns between two colonies of young marmosets
(Callithrix jacchus).

Goss AN.

The tooth eruption patterns of two large groups of young living marmosets were
compared. The eruption sequence was essentially similar and was consistent with
previous studies based on smaller numbers of dead animals. At nine mo, however,
one group was more advanced than the other, although their craniofacial growth
patterns were similar.

The aging of the population and environmental noise have contributed to high
rates of presbycusis, also known as age-related hearing loss (ARHL). Because mice
have a relatively short life span, murine models have not been suitable for
determining the mechanism of presbycusis development and methods of diagnosis.
Although the common marmoset, a non-human primate (NHP), is an ideal animal model
for studying age-related diseases, its auditory spectrum has not been
systematically studied. Auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) from 38 marmosets of 
different ages demonstrated that auditory function correlated with age. Hearing
loss in geriatric common marmosets started at ultra-high frequency (>16 kHz),
then extended to lower frequencies. Despite age-related deterioration of ABR
threshold and amplitude in marmosets, outer hair cell (OHC) function remained
stable at all ages. Spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs), which are the first auditory 
neurons in the auditory system, were found to degenerate distinctly in aged
common marmosets, indicating that neural degeneration caused presbycusis in these
animals. Similarly, age-associated ABR deterioration without loss of OHC function
was observed in another NHP, rhesus monkeys. Audiometry results from these two
species of NHP suggested that NHPs were ideal for studying ARHL and that neural
presbycusis at high frequency may be prevalent in primates.

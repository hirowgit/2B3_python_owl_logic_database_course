Human alphaherpesvirus 1 (HuAHV1) causes fatal neurologic infections in captive
New World primates. To determine risks for interspecies transmission, we examined
data for 13 free-ranging, black-tufted marmosets (Callithrix penicillata) that
died of HuAHV1 infection and had been in close contact with humans in anthropized
areas in Brazil during 2012-2019. We evaluated pathologic changes in the
marmosets, localized virus and antigen, and assessed epidemiologic features. The 
main clinical findings were neurologic signs, necrotizing meningoencephalitis,
and ulcerative glossitis; 1 animal had necrotizing hepatitis. Transmission
electron microscopy revealed intranuclear herpetic inclusions, and immunostaining
revealed HuAHV1 and herpesvirus particles in neurons, glial cells, tongue mucosal
epithelium, and hepatocytes. PCR confirmed HuAHV1 infection. These findings
illustrate how disruption of the One Health equilibrium in anthropized
environments poses risks for interspecies virus transmission with potential
spillover not only from animals to humans but also from humans to free-ranging
nonhuman primates or other animals.

Rapid inactivation of Ebola virus (EBOV) is crucial for high-throughput testing
of clinical samples in low-resource, outbreak scenarios. The EBOV inactivation
efficacy of Buffer AVL (Qiagen) was tested against marmoset serum (EBOV
concentration of 1 × 10(8) 50% tissue culture infective dose per milliliter
[TCID50 · ml(-1)]) and murine blood (EBOV concentration of 1 × 10(7) TCID50 ·
ml(-1)) at 4:1 vol/vol buffer/sample ratios. Posttreatment cell culture and
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analysis indicated that treatment with 
Buffer AVL did not inactivate EBOV in 67% of samples, indicating that Buffer AVL,
which is designed for RNA extraction and not virus inactivation, cannot be
guaranteed to inactivate EBOV in diagnostic samples. Murine blood samples treated
with ethanol (4:1 [vol/vol] ethanol/sample) or heat (60°C for 15 min) also showed
no viral inactivation in 67% or 100% of samples, respectively. However, combined 
Buffer AVL and ethanol or Buffer AVL and heat treatments showed total viral
inactivation in 100% of samples tested. The Buffer AVL plus ethanol and Buffer
AVL plus heat treatments were also shown not to affect the extraction of PCR
quality RNA from EBOV-spiked murine blood samples.

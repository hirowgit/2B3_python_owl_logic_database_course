The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is increasingly being utilised as a
nonhuman primate model for human disease, ranging from autoimmune to infectious
disease. In order to fully exploit these models, meaningful comparison to the
human host response is necessary. Commercially available reagents, primarily
targeted to human cells, were utilised to assess the phenotype and activation
status of key immune cell types and cytokines in naive and infected animals.
Single cell suspensions of blood, spleen, and lung were examined. Generally, the 
phenotype of cells was comparable between humans and marmosets, with
approximately 63% of all lymphocytes in the blood of marmosets being T cells, 25%
B-cells, and 12% NK cells. The percentage of neutrophils in marmoset blood were
more similar to human values than mouse values. Comparison of the activation
status of cells following experimental systemic or inhalational infection
exhibited different trends in different tissues, most obvious in cell types
active in the innate immune response. This work significantly enhances the
ability to understand the immune response in these animals and fortifies their
use as models of infectious disease.

Cytoarchitecture of the oculomotor nuclear complex and of the trochlear nucleus
in the marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).

Reis FP, Machado LM.

The cytoarchitecture of the oculomotor nuclear complex (ONC) and of the trochlear
nucleus (TN) was studied in the encephalon of 10 adult marmosets (Callithrix
jacchus). All the encephala were fixed with Bouin, embedded in paraffin and
submitted to 20-mum serial sections in the transversal, frontal and horizontal
directions. The following staining methods were employed: Nissl, Kluver-Barrera, 
and Pal-Weigert, modified by Erhart [1951]. Morphologically we delimited four
cell columns in the ONC of the marmoset, namely lateral, dorsal, anterior, and
dorsal central. The lateral and dorsal central columns comparatively correspond, 
in man, to the somatic portion. The others to the visceral portion. The trochlear
nucleus of the marmoset is compact, round in shape and can be divided in to
central cellular, dorsoventral and ventrolateral groups. The neurons of both the 
nuclei, of the multipolar type, predominantly have a round shape but it is also
possible to observe oval or triangular neurons. They have a central nucleus, the 
Nissl substance is not dense and is irregularly disposed. Some differences in the
size of neurons can be observed among the columns of the ONC.

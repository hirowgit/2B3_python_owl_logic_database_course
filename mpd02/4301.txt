Using specific polyclonal antibodies generated against a 13 Kd human testicular
inhibin, immunocytochemical localization was carried out in epididymis of intact 
and castrated marmoset monkey and rat epididymis. Inhibin was found to be present
in the cytoplasm of epithelial cells of caput, corpus and cauda epididymis. The
intensity of staining and pattern of distribution did not change following
castration. Further, the in vitro biosynthesis of inhibin studied by
incorporating 3H-leucine and precipitating it with specific antibody indicated
maximum biosynthesis in the corpus epididymis in case of marmosets and cauda in
case of rats. Following castration in rats, the epididymal tissue still retained 
the capacity to biosynthesize inhibin. These studies indicate that marmoset and
rat epididymis are capable of biosynthesizing/absorbing inhibin and whose
synthesis does not depend on androgens.

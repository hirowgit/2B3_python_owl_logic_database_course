The atypical antidepressant, bupropion, causes a partial reversal of motor
deficits in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-treated primates.
However, its monoamine uptake blocking actions are believed to be mediated by the
major metabolites, racemic
(-)-(2R,3R)-2-(3-chlorophenyl-3,5,5-trimethyl-2-morphinol) (R,R-hydroxybupropion)
and (+)-(2S,3S)-2-(3-chlorophenyl-3,5,5-trimethyl-2-morphinol)
(S,S-hydroxybupropion). Therefore, we have evaluated the ability of enantiomers
to improve locomotor activity and motor disability in
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-treated common marmosets. Bupropion 
produced a little increase in locomotor activity and a more pronounced
improvement in motor disability. The S,S-hydroxybupropion, but not the
R,R-hydroxybupropion, enantiomer dose-dependently increased both locomotor
activity and reversed motor disability. Combined administration of
S,S-hydroxybupropion and R,R-hydroxybupropion at the same dose (analogous to the 
racemate) again improved motor function and to the same extent as produced by
S,S-hydroxybupropion alone. The data suggest that the S,S-enantiomer of
hydroxybupropion may possess potential antiparkinsonian activity.

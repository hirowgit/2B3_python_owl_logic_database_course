In this study, we report the identification of a hitherto not reported direct
retinal projection to midline and intralaminar thalamic nuclei in the marmoset
brain. After unilateral intravitreal injections of cholera toxin subunit B (CTb),
anterogradely transported CTb-immunoreactive fibers and presumptive terminals
were seen in the following thalamic midline nuclei: paraventricular, rhomboid,
interanteromedial, and reuniens, and thalamic intralaminar nuclei: central
medial, central lateral, central dorsal, and parafascicular. Studies employing
sensitive tracers in other primate species are needed in order to verify the
possible universality of these projections. Some of the possible functional
correlates of the present data are briefly discussed. The present results may
contribute to the elucidation of the anatomical substrate of the functionally
demonstrated involvement of this midline/intralaminar thalamic nuclear complex in
several domains that include arousal and awareness, besides specific cognitive,
sensory, and motor functions.

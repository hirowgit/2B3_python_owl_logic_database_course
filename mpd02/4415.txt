Effects of male partners upon the expression of female proceptivity were examined
in two experiments using 16 ovariectomized marmosets. Experiment 1 showed that
the female's proceptive tongue-flicking display (PTF) is triggered specifically
by eye contact with the male. Stimulation of PTF by administration of
estradiol-17 beta (E2) to ovariectomized females depends in part upon the male's 
responsiveness to female displays, such as "staring" and "freezing," which may
serve to attract his attention and to establish eye contact. Experiment 2
provided evidence that females' proceptivity decreases if their male partners are
lesioned in the preoptic area/anterior hypothalamus. Such males are sexually
hypoactive and less responsive to the females' visual displays. However, E2 still
activates PTF if females succeed in initiating eye contact with males. Results
indicate that variability in effects of E2 upon proceptivity in marmosets may be 
influenced by subtle aspects of facial communication between the sexes as well as
by individual differences in hormonal sensitivity. Copulatory activity in males
is not essential for E2 to exert its stimulatory action upon proceptivity in
female marmosets.

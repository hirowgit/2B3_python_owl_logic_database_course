BACKGROUND: Barbiturate euthanasia solutions are a humane and approved means of
euthanasia. Overdosing causes significant tissue damage in a variety of
laboratory animals.
METHODS: One hundred seventeen non-human primates (NHP) representing 7 species
including 12 fetuses euthanized for humane and research reasons by various
vascular routes with Euthasol, Sodium Pentobarbital, Fatal Plus, Beuthanasia D,
or Euthanasia 5 were evaluated for euthanasia-induced tissue damage. Lungs and
livers were histologically graded for hemolysis, vascular damage, edema, and
necrosis. Severity of tissue damage was analyzed for differences on the basis of 
agent, age, sex, dose, and injection route.
RESULTS: Severity of tissue damage was directly related to dose and the
intracardiac injection route, but did not differ by species, sex, and agent used.
CONCLUSIONS: When the recommended dose of agent was used, tissue damage was
generally reduced, minimal, or undetectable. Barbiturate-induced artifacts in
NHPs are essentially the same as in other laboratory species.

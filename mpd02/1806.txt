Endotracheal intubation was carried out in 11 common marmosets (Callithrix
jacchus). A commercially available tilting stand and a Miller laryngoscope blade 
were used to visualize the larynx. Anaesthesia was induced with alphaxalone (10.6
± 1.6 mg/kg intramuscularly, followed by 3.2 ± 1.2 mg/kg intravenously). The
diameter of the proximal trachea easily fitted an endotracheal tube made from
readily available material (a 12 G 'over the needle' catheter). Once the tip of
the endotracheal tube was at the level of the vocal folds, the tube had to be
gently rotated through a 180° angle in order to pass through the larynx into the 
trachea. Assessment of the dimensions of the larynx and trachea, and comparison
with external anatomical features of the animals (n = 10) showed that the length 
of the trachea could be predicted by multiplying the craniosacral length of the
marmoset by a factor of 0.42.

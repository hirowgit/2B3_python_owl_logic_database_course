This study was designed to identify and characterize further Streptococcus
agalactiae isolated during routine diagnostics from three diseased dogs and a
cat, as well as from the inner organs of a monkey which died on a sepsis with
beta-haemolytic streptococci. The cultures could be identified as streptococci of
serological group B by cultural, biochemical and serological properties and by
restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of polymerase chain reaction
(PCR)-amplified 16S ribosomal DNA. A further characterization of the isolates by 
serotyping and by determination of antibiotic resistances revealed a close
relationship of these isolates to the human biotype of this species.

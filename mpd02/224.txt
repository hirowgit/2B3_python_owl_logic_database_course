BACKGROUND: The successive reports of Platynosomum illiciens in Neotropical
captive primates have increased interest in platynosomosis; however, its
treatment is little known.
METHODS: Callithrix penicillata (n = 10) naturally and chronically infected with 
P. illiciens were treated with praziquantel (25 mg/kg BW, three s.c. doses at
24 hours intervals), and coproparasitological tests performed over 67 days. The
proportions of primates with a reduction in fecal egg counts (FEC) or negative
results progressively increased after treatment, and at the last fecal tests,
marmosets were negative.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Although all primates tolerated the initial days of
study well, 40% (4/10) of them died between the 8th and 16th days after the onset
of treatment. Clinical signs and necropsies indicated the occurrence of hepatic
involvement, biliary obstruction, and cholangitis. Marmosets with a higher
previous FEC were more likely to die after treatment. Use of praziquantel should 
be considered carefully on a case-by-case basis.

Marmosets exchange two types of calls: phees and trills. We played back phees and
trills to investigate the temporal rules of vocal exchanges using ten captive
common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus). The marmosets usually emitted the same
type of vocalizations just after the stimulus playbacks, and similar regularities
were observed in the temporal intervals of phees and in trills. They vocalized
with shorter intervals when they responded with trills rather than phees, and,
after the first call, they repeatedly vocalized trills with shorter intervals
than phees. These results suggest that the temporal rules between phees and
trills are qualitatively similar but quantitatively different. These results
might be owing to the different distances over which these contact calls are
used.

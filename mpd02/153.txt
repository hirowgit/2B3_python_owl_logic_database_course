The excellent adaptability of Callithrix jacchus to life in captivity presents
advantages in comparison to other nonhuman primates that are used in experimental
models for biomedical research, which explains the increasing scientific interest
in investigating the anatomical characteristics of this species. Owing to the
relative scarcity of publications on the descriptive morphology of the heart of
C. jacchus, the aim of this study was to quantify the presence of collagen in the
left and right ventricular myocardium using modified picrosirius red and acid
fuchsine colorimetric assays. The myocardium of the right ventricle presented a
higher percentage of collagen than that of the left ventricle. No sex-related
differences were observed between the groups. Interestingly, the absolute values 
of collagen were different depending on the method used for quantification
(modified picrosirius red vs. acid fuchsine). The level of collagen
quantification observed in the ventricular myocardium of C. jacchus was similar
to that seen in other nonhuman primates traditionally used in experimental models
of cardiac diseases.

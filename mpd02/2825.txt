RNA silencing processes are guided by small RNAs that are derived from
double-stranded RNA. To probe for function of RNA silencing during infection of
human cells by a DNA virus, we recorded the small RNA profile of cells infected
by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). We show that EBV expresses several microRNA (miRNA) 
genes. Given that miRNAs function in RNA silencing pathways either by targeting
messenger RNAs for degradation or by repressing translation, we identified viral 
regulators of host and/or viral gene expression.

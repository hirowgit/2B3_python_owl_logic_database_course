Traditional retinal projections target three functionally complementary systems
in the brain of mammals: the primary visual system, the visuomotor integration
systems and the circadian timing system. In recent years, studies in several
animals have been conducted to investigate the retinal projections to these three
systems, despite some evidence of additional targets. The aim of this study was
to disclose a previously unknown connection between the retina and the
parabrachial complex of the common marmoset, by means of the intraocular
injection of cholera toxin subunit b. A few labeled retinal fibers/terminals that
are detected in the medial parabrachial portion of the marmoset brain show clear 
varicosities, suggesting terminal fields. Although the possible role of these
projections remains unknown, they may provide a modulation of the cholinergic
parabrachial neurons which project to the thalamic dorsal lateral geniculate
nucleus.

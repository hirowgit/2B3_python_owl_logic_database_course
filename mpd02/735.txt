Animal models have been critical in building evidence that the prenatal
experience and intrauterine environment are capable of exerting profound and
permanent effects on metabolic health through developmental programming of
obesity. However, despite physiological and evolutionary similarities, nonhuman
primate models are relatively rare. The common marmoset monkey ( Callithrix
jacchus) is a New World monkey that has been used as a biomedical model for well 
more than 50 years and has recently been framed as an appropriate model for
exploring early-life impacts on later health and disease. The spontaneous,
multifactorial, and early-life development of obesity in the common marmoset make
it a valuable research model for advancing our knowledge about the role of the
prenatal and placental mechanisms involved in developmental programming of
obesity. This paper provides a brief overview of obesity in the common marmoset, 
followed by a discussion of marmoset reproduction and placental characteristics. 
We then discuss the occurrence and utility of variable intrauterine environments 
in developmental programming in marmosets. Evidence of developmental programming 
of obesity will be given, and finally, we put forward future directions and
innovations for including the placenta in developmental programming of obesity in
the common marmoset.

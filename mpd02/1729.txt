Embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells (IPSCs) derived from mammalian
species are valuable tools for modeling human disease, including retinal
degenerative eye diseases that result in visual loss. Restoration of vision has
focused on transplantation of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and retinal
pigmented epithelium (RPE) to the retina. Here we used transgenic common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus) and human pluripotent stem cells carrying the enhanced green
fluorescent protein (eGFP) reporter as a model system for retinal
differentiation. Using suspension and subsequent adherent differentiation
cultures, we observed spontaneous in vitro differentiation that included NPCs and
cells with pigment granules characteristic of differentiated RPE. Retinal cells
derived from human and common marmoset pluripotent stem cells provide potentially
unlimited cell sources for testing safety and immune compatibility following
autologous or allogeneic transplantation using nonhuman primates in early
translational applications.

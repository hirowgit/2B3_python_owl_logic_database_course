A comparison of craniofacial growth between two colonies of marmosets (Callithrix
jacchus).

Townsend GC, White J, Goss AN.

General and craniofacial measurements from young marmosets in a recently
established Australian colony are presented and compared with similar data
published for a long-established colony in the United Kingdom. Statistically
significant differences between the colonies were those associated with large
error variances, suggesting difficulties in locating certain landmarks rather
than real differences in growth. Thus, direct comparison can be made between
craniofacial growth studies conducted at these two different marmoset colonies.

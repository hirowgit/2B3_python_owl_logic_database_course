During the last decade it has become clear that colour vision in platyrrhines
(New World monkeys) differs from the uniform trichromatic pattern normally found 
in catarrhines (Old World monkeys, apes and human). Colour vision in most
platyrrhine species is polymorphic, with many dichromatic individuals. The
comparison of response properties in retinal ganglion cells and lateral
geniculate cells between catarrhines and playrrhines elucidates how the evolution
of trichromatic colour vision influenced the post-receptoral processing. We find 
that spatial and temporal processing is very similar in the platyrrhine and
catarrhine retina, strongly suggesting that the retinal structure and function,
found in living anthropoids, was already present in their common ancestor.

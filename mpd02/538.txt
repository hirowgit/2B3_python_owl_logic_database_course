Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) was first identified as a potent mitogen for
mature hepatocytes, and has also gained attention as a strong neurotrophic factor
in the central nervous system. We found that during the acute phase of spinal
cord injury (SCI) in rats, c-Met, the specific receptor for HGF, increases
sharply, while the endogenous HGF up-regulation is relatively weak. Introducing
exogenous HGF into the spinal cord by injecting an HGF-expressing viral vector
significantly increased the neuron and oligodendrocyte survival, angiogenesis,
and axonal regeneration, to reduce the area of damage and to promote functional
recovery in rats after SCI. Other recent studies in rodents have shown that
exogenously administered HGF during the acute phase of SCI reduces astrocyte
activation to decrease glial scar formation, and exerts anti-inflammatory effects
to reduce leukocyte infiltration. We also reported that the intrathecal infusion 
of recombinant human HGF (intrathecal rhHGF) improves neurological hand function 
after cervical contusive SCI in the common marmoset, a non-human primate. Based
on these collective results, we conducted a phase I/II clinical trial of
intrathecal rhHGF for patients with acute cervical SCI who showed a modified
Frankel grade of A/B1/B2 72 h after injury onset, from June 2014 to May 2018.

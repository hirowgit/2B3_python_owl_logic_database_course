Determination of ovulation and pregnancy in the marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) by 
monitoring of urinary hydroxypregnanolone excretion.

Heger W, Neubert D.

In Callithrix jacchus the urinary excretion of hydroxypregnanolone (5
alpha-pregnane-3 alpha, 7 alpha-diol-20-one) shows a luteal rise during the
ovulatory cycle. This progesterone metabolite can therefore be used as an
indication of ovulation, implantation, and subsequently for the persistence of
the pregnancy. The excretion can be monitored by high performance thin-layer
chromatography (HPTLC) and postchromatographic derivatization after enzymatic
hydrolysis of the conjugate. Profiles of urinary hydroxypregnanolone levels are
presented and correlated with luteinizing hormone excretion. The method is
noninvasive and therefore suited for long-term studies in these monkeys.

It has been suggested that lower motor neurons containing calcium-binding
proteins (CBP) may be resistant to degeneration in motor neuron disease. The
testing of this hypothesis is hampered by lack of comprehensive information
regarding the presence of CBPs in motor neurons. To address this shortcoming, we 
investigated the distribution of the CBPs calbindin-D28K (CB), parvalbumin (PV)
and calretinin (CRT) in lower motor neurons in the normal human and two non-human
primates (rhesus monkey and common marmoset) using immunohistochemistry. A
variable proportion of motor neurons in cranial nerve motor nuclei contained
immunoreactivity for one or more CBPs. A subpopulation of spinal cord alpha-motor
neurons was also CBP-positive. Comparison of staining for choline
acetyltransferase (ChAT) and CBPs in the human spinal cord demonstrated that
approximately 63% of ventral horn motor neurons contained PV, 53% contained CRT
and 56% contained CB. CBP immunoreactivity within motor neurons was of variable
staining intensity. It remains to be established whether the presence of these
CBPs confers protection against the pathogenic mechanisms of motor neuron
disease.

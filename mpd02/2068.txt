BACKGROUND: Animals in captivity should receive adequate sunlight exposure for
sufficient generation of vitamin D [25(OH)D]. In the present study, 25(OH)D serum
levels of 84 Callithrix penicillata primates were evaluated.
OBJECTIVES: To determine 25(OH)D levels of those animals; to evaluate the
influence of gender and period of sunlight exposure on their 25(OH)D levels.
METHODS: Three groups were evaluated: group 1 (n = 29) on free sunlight exposure;
group 2 (n = 34) on partial sunlight exposure; group 3 (n = 21) without sunlight 
exposure.
RESULTS: The obtained 25(OH)D values were: group 1, 121.2 +/- 33.3 ng/ml; group
2, 115.2 +/- 32.2 ng/ml; group 3, 53.3 +/- 10.4 ng/ml. Significant statistical
differences were obtained between groups 1 and 3 (p < 0.001) and groups 2 and 3
(p < 0.001); no statistical difference was found between genders.
CONCLUSION: Direct sunlight exposure is essential for 25(OH)D sufficiency and it 
is proposed that the 25(OH)D normal range for captive Callithrix penicillata
would be from 104.8 to 137.1 ng/ml (CI = 95%).

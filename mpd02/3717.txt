General conformity was found concerning age-dependent changes in the major
subsets (CD4, CD8, CD2, CD20) and the adhesion molecules CD11a and CD29 on
peripheral blood lymphocytes in children and young marmosets (Callithrix
jacchus). Differences exist in the expression of the surface receptors CD45RA and
CD56. Taking the total number of white blood cells into account, an age-related
increase in the absolute numbers of peripheral blood lymphocytes was found in
marmosets whereas in children, an age-dependent decrease was observed. The
definition of reference ranges for different stages of maturation in children and
young marmosets may serve as a basis on which comparative risk assessment of
possible effects on lymphocyte subsets after pre- or perinatal drug exposure can 
be estimated.

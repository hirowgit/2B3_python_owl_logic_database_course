Giardia intestinalis is a common protozoan parasite that can infect many
laboratory animal primates, although its role as a contributor to the induction
of gastrointestinal disease remains unclear. This study sought to investigate the
prevalence of Giardia in a colony of common marmosets by using a Giardia
antigen-capture assay and to address the possible eradication of this infection
by using tinidazole, an antiprotozoal similar to metronidazole but requiring
fewer doses. Among 31 colony marmosets, 13 (42%) were positive for Giardia. Two
doses of oral tinidazole eliminated the infection in all animals. Repeat testing 
of the 13 Giardia-positive monkeys 1 y later showed that 11 remained negative and
that treated animals had a significant increase in weight at 1 y. Giardia antigen
is common in common marmoset feces, and treatment using oral tinidazole is
possible and highly effective.

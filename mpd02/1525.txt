BACKGROUND: The acute abdomen is any abdominal disorder resulting in pain, shock,
or sepsis. Although it has a multifactorial etiology, the primary cause is
gastrointestinal tract pathology. The aim of this study was to assess the
contribution of abdominal ultrasound as a complementary diagnostic tool in
non-human primates with an acute abdomen.
METHODS: Three different non-human primates with clinical signs of acute abdomen 
were evaluated as follows: a chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), a tufted capuchin
(Cebus apella), and a black-tufted marmoset (Callithrix penicillata).
RESULTS: Ultrasonographic examination assisted in the identification of a variety
of differential diagnoses and was used in decision-making for exploratory
laparotomy, which was performed in two animals. Ultrasound examination confirmed 
the source of the acute abdomen as the gastrointestinal tract in the three
animals studied.
CONCLUSIONS: Abdominal ultrasound is a useful technique for the investigation of 
signs of acute abdomen in non-human primates.

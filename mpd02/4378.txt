The ultrastructural features of the principal cell in the epididymal epithelium
of the marmosets are distinguished by an intercellular exchange of substances
contained within cytoplasmic vesicles and the presence of paracrystalline bodies.
The possibility of the exchange of substances constituting paracriny and the
paracrystalline inclusion having a role in steroidogenic activity is discussed.

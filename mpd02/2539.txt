A series of experiments investigating the degree of gaze understanding in common 
marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) is reported. Results show that marmosets follow
the gaze of a human experimenter readily and also use the gaze to locate food in 
a modified version of the object choice task if influences of chance
probabilities and prepotent response tendencies are controlled for. In addition, 
this new version of the task allows the assessment of the accuracy of gaze
following. Marmosets precisely extrapolate gaze direction, past distracting
objects and from considerable distances, thereby meeting the criteria of
so-called geometrical gaze following. The presence of this ability in common
marmosets suggests that higher forms of gaze following might be more widely
distributed among nonhuman primates than previously thought.

Neural stem cells (NSCs) are multipotent and self-renewing precursor cells that
give rise to all cell types of the central nervous system (CNS). They can be used
for modeling CNS in vitro, for developmental studies and for cell replacement
therapies. NSCs can be derived from pluripotent stem cells through
differentiation using specific growth factors. Nonhuman primates (NHP) are
critical preclinical models for translational research. Induced pluripotent stem 
cells (iPSCs) can be generated from NHP for the purposes of allogenic or
autologous cell replacement studies. Here, we describe the derivation of NSCs
from NHP iPSCs.

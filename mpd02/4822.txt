and response after EBV inoculation.

Healthy common marmosets from two separate colonies, one in England and one in
France, were found to have antibodies cross-reacting with Epstein-Barr virus
structural antigens (EBV-VCA). All seropositive animals were at least 2 years
old. Experimental EBV infection of marmosets of different ages led to
seroconversion of inoculated weanlings. Adult animals either developed antibody
for the first time or showed an increase in their existing titers. Both control
and infected animals developed a progressive interstitial nephritis. The
lymphocytic infiltration was more extensive, diffuse and immature in appearance
in inoculated animals, but no definite evidence of lymphoproliferative disease or
lymphoma was found.

We report a case of interspecies adoption of an infant marmoset (Callithrix
jacchus) by wild capuchin monkeys (Cebus libidinosus). The marmoset was an infant
when it was first observed in the capuchin group on 3 March 2004. Since it first 
appeared it has been observed informally and frequently. In January 2005
systematic observations were made of the marmoset and a capuchin of similar age. 
Throughout its period of adoption the marmoset appeared to be socially integrated
into the group, benefiting from nurturant behaviors exhibited by two successive
adoptive "mothers" and pronounced tolerance from all members of the group. This
case highlights the flexibility of both Callithrix and Cebus in accommodating
variable social behaviors and other characteristics (including size) of social
partners.

BACKGROUND: The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is of interest for
reproductive studies because of their high and variable fertility in captivity.
However, to understand this variability, much basic information still needs to be
gathered. This study is the first to characterize marmoset semen comparing a
German and a Brazilian colony.
METHODS: All animals were weighted, and semen samples were collected by penile
vibratory stimulation and analyzed according to standard criteria.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The German animals had a higher mean and maximum weight 
than the Brazilian. Further, sperm concentration tended to be higher with heavier
animals in the German population, but not in the Brazilian. Additionally, major
defects tended to be more frequent with higher weight but also only in German
sample. In spite of these differences, the total range and variability in sperm
concentration were similar in both populations, suggesting that this is
characteristic for the species.

The effects of single and repeated doses of trimethyltin (TMT) treatment on the
central nervous system (CNS) of the marmoset were investigated. For the
acute-dose experiment adult animals were administered 3 mg/kg of TMT chloride
(ip) and were then observed for changes in behavior. Within 24 hr postinjection
all animals developed tremors, ataxia, and unresponsiveness. Half of the animals 
had severe clinical deterioration and died at 2 to 3 days following treatment.
Surviving marmosets were sacrificed and the brain was subsequently
perfusion-fixed for light microscopic examination. Neuronal degeneration was
observed in many cells of the Ammon's horn and fascia dentata of the hippocampus.
For the chronic-dose experiment, adult marmosets received (ip) weekly doses of
0.75 mg/kg of TMT chloride for 24 weeks. No evident clinical signs or behavioral 
changes were observed in any of the treated animals. Histological examination
revealed neuropathological changes comparatively similar but less severe than
those observed in the acute-treated animals. The differences in toxicity effects 
between acute and chronic TMT administration are compared and discussed.

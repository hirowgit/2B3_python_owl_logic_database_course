Two sexually mature marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) showing clinical signs similar
to those seen in wasting marmoset syndrome (weight loss, decreased muscle mass,
and alopecia) were evaluated for clinical and anatomic pathologic changes. The
most prominent clinical pathologic alterations included macrocytic normochromic
anemia, hypoproteinemia, hypoalbuminemia, elevated serum aspartate
aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase levels, and previously unreported
changes of thrombocytosis. The principal gross and histopathologic finding was
chronic colitis, which appeared to be the most important contributing factor to
the development of wasting syndrome in these marmosets.

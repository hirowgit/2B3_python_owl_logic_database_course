Live, attenuated F' hepatitis A vaccine virus was studied in vivo in Saguinus
labiatus marmosets for possible reversion to virulence, for possible
establishment of persistent infection and for its capacity as a parenterally
administered vaccine to induce immunity to oral infection. Serial transmission of
the virus in S. labiatus, using infectious stool extracts for the second and
third passages, produced no evidence of reversion of the F' vaccine virus to
virulence. Monitoring for live HAV in stools over a 135-day period
post-inoculation of marmosets with the F' vaccine revealed no evidence of
persistent infection. Vaccinated animals were also shown to be resistant to
infection on challenge by the oral route as well as by the previously
demonstrated parenteral route.

The psychostimulant drug modafinil induces a reversal of motor deficits in MPTP
treated primates and prevents MPTP toxicity to substantia nigra but its mechanism
of action is not clear. In common marmosets acutely treated with MPTP in the
presence or absence of modafinil, we have studied changes in GABA(A) receptor
binding in the basal ganglia. MPTP treatment had no effect on
[(3)H]-flunitrazepam (FNZ) binding density in the striatum or external globus
pallidus (GPe) but increased [(3)H]-FNZ binding density in the internal globus
pallidus (GPi). Administration of modafinil (10-100 mg/kg) with MPTP did not
alter [(3)H]-FNZ binding density in the striatum or GPe. Low doses of modafinil
(10 and 30 mg/kg) had no effect on the increased [(3)H]-FNZ binding density in
the GPi but high dose modafinil (100 mg/kg) significantly decreased [(3)H]-FNZ
binding density in GPi. These findings suggest that modafinil can selectively
alter GABA binding density in the GPi either by preventing MPTP-induced toxicity 
or through an action on striatal output pathway related to its antiparkinsonian
activity and its ability to inhibit MPTP toxicity.

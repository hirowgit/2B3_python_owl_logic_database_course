The availability of a robust disease model is essential for the development of
countermeasures for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).
While a rhesus macaque model of MERS-CoV has been established, the lack of
uniform, severe disease in this model complicates the analysis of countermeasure 
studies. Modeling of the interaction between the MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein and 
its receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 predicted comparable interaction energies in 
common marmosets and humans. The suitability of the marmoset as a MERS-CoV model 
was tested by inoculation via combined intratracheal, intranasal, oral and ocular
routes. Most of the marmosets developed a progressive severe pneumonia leading to
euthanasia of some animals. Extensive lesions were evident in the lungs of all
animals necropsied at different time points post inoculation. Some animals were
also viremic; high viral loads were detected in the lungs of all infected
animals, and total RNAseq demonstrated the induction of immune and inflammatory
pathways. This is the first description of a severe, partially lethal, disease
model of MERS-CoV, and as such will have a major impact on the ability to assess 
the efficacy of vaccines and treatment strategies as well as allowing more
detailed pathogenesis studies.

The dopamine neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)
produces histological lesions in the hypothalamus of the common marmoset.

Gibb WR, Lees AJ, Jenner P, Marsden CD.

The administration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) to
marmosets resulted in parkinsonism and degeneration of the substantia nigra pars 
compacta. Examination of the hypothalamus showed neuronophagic-like rosettes of
glial cells and diffuse increase in glial numbers in areas of the dopaminergic
A11-A14 groups. These findings suggest that MPTP may be toxic to dopamine neurons
of the hypothalamus as well as to the substantia nigra.

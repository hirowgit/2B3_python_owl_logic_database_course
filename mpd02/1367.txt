Studies of social learning and tradition formation under field conditions have
recently gained momentum, but suffer from the limited control of socio-ecological
factors thought to be responsible for transmission patterns. The use of
artificial visual stimuli is a potentially powerful tool to overcome some of
these problems. Here, in a field experiment, we used video images of unfamiliar
conspecifics performing virtual demonstrations of foraging techniques. We tested 
12 family groups of wild common marmosets. Six groups received video
demonstrations (footage of conspecifics either pulling a drawer open or pushing a
lid upwards, in an 'artificial fruit'); the other six groups served as controls
(exposed to a static image of a conspecific next to the fruit). Subjects in video
groups were more manipulative and successful in opening the fruit than controls; 
they were also more likely to use the technique they had witnessed and thus could
serve as live models for other family members. To our knowledge, this is the
first study that used video demonstrations in the wild and demonstrated the
potent force of social learning, even from unfamiliar conspecifics, under field
conditions.

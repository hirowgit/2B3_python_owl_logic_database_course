:  Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania sp. are important protozoan parasites for
humans and animals in the Americas, causing Chagas disease and cutaneous or
visceral leishmaniasis, respectively. These vector-borne diseases affect
permanent and transient populations in developing tropical countries that exhibit
favorable conditions for the perpetuation of the parasite cycle. Our objective
was to investigate the occurrence of infection with these parasites in wild
animals from urban rainforest fragments in the city of Salvador, the largest city
in the northeast region of Brazil. Sixty-five wild animals were captured,
clinically examined, and sampled for parasite detection by PCR and culture. Ten
different mammalian genera were identified, being 58% (38/65) marsupials. The
prevalence of T. cruzi and Leishmania sp. infections was 13% and 43%,
respectively. Both parasites were detected by PCR in 11% (7/65), three of which
were also double infected as determined by culture. Among the 28 animals found
infected with at least one parasite (43%, 28/65), 68% (19/28) were marsupials,
two specimens were Callithrix sp. (7%), and one was Trinomys sp. (3%). Most
infected animals (89%) had no clinical signs of disease. We found that healthy
free-living animals from urban rainforest fragments harbored pathogenic
trypanosomatids and should be included in epidemiology studies of diseases in big
cities in tropical countries, as these cities grow and engulf rainforest
remnants.

Plasmodium knowlesi in the marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).

Langhorne J, Cohen S.

Common marmosets were shown to be susceptible to Plasmodium knowlesi malaria. The
morphology of the parasite was indistinguishable from the observed in the natural
host (Macaca fascicularis) and the common laboratory model (Macaca mulatta). A
differential susceptibility to P. knowlesi was observed in the 8 marmosets
studied. Multiplication rates of parasites were variable over 24 h periods. Five 
animals died of a fulminating infection within 12--17 days after challenge. Three
animals recovered spontaneously from infection and were subsequently resistant to
challenge with homologous and heterologous variants and strains of P. knowlesi.
This resistance was maintained for intervals up to 100 days between challenge
infections.

With the aim of further investigating the molecular evolution of beta defensin
genes, after having analysed beta defensin 1 (DEFB1) in humans and several
nonhuman primate species, we have studied the evolution of the beta defensin 2
gene (DEFB2), which codifies for a peptide with antimicrobial and chemoattractant
activity, in humans and 16 primate species. We have found evidence of positive
selection during the evolution of orthologous DEFB2 genes at two points on a
phylogenetic tree relating these primates: during the divergence of the
platyrrhines from the catarrhines and during the divergence of the
Cercopithecidae from the Hylobatidae, Great Apes and humans. Furthermore, amino
acid variations in Old World Monkeys seem to centre either on residues that are
involved in oligomerisation in the human molecule, or that are conserved (40-80%)
in beta-defensins in general. It is thus likely that these variations affect the 
biological function of the molecules and suggest that their synthesis and
functional analysis might reveal interesting new information as to their role in 
innate immunity.

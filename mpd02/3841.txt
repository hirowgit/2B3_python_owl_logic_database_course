Of 1,106 New World primates necropsied from the National Zoological Park
(Washington, D.C.) and the Department of Comparative Pathology, Johns Hopkins
University School of Medicine (Baltimore, Maryland) 22 (1.9%) animals were
identified with 27 neoplasms. Of this group, nine animals (two females, seven
males) had a total of 13 endocrine neoplasms. All animals were adults, with an
age range of 2.7-25 years (average, 12.1 years). Seven were Callitrichidae and
two were Cebidae. The adrenal gland was the most affected organ, with seven
(53.8%) neoplasms, followed by the pituitary and thyroid gland with two (15.4%)
cases each, and the pancreas and parathyroid gland with one tumor (7.7%) each.
All neoplastic disorders were benign. Immunocytochemistry assays for growth
hormone, adrenocorticotropic hormone, prolactin, follicle-stimulating hormone,
luteinizing hormone, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and chromogranin A were
performed on two pituitary neoplasms. Pheochromocytoma was the most frequent
neoplasm, representing 5 (38.4%) of the 13 neoplasms. The remaining were thyroid 
cystadenoma (two, 15.4%), corticotrophic cell pituitary adenoma (two, 15.4%),
adrenal ganglioneuroma (one, 7.7%), adrenal cortical adenoma (one, 7.7%),
parathyroid chief-cell adenoma (one, 7.7%), and pancreatic islet-cell adenoma
(one, 7.7%).

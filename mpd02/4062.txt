The design of effective prevention strategies for multiple sclerosis (MS) is
hampered by ignorance of the basic pathophysiology of the disease. An
understanding of specific immune mechanisms, the nature of genetic
susceptibility, and environmental triggers will permit rational decision making
from among the many proposed therapeutic directions available. It is reasonable
to hypothesize that inhibition of central nervous system inflammation will be of 
benefit in MS, regardless of the trigger (autoantigen, exogenous antigen, or
nonspecific trigger). Emerging concepts are reviewed to provide guideposts for
the design of rational therapy for MS.

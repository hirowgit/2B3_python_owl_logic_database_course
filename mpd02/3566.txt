The formation of fibrillar deposits of amyloid beta protein (Abeta) in the brain 
is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). A central question is
whether Abeta plays a direct role in the neurodegenerative process in AD. The
involvement of Abeta in the neurodegenerative process is suggested by the
neurotoxicity of the fibrillar form of Abeta in vitro. However, mice transgenic
for the Abeta precursor protein that develop amyloid deposits in the brain do not
show the degree of neuronal loss or tau phosphorylation found in AD. Here we show
that microinjection of plaque-equivalent concentrations of fibrillar, but not
soluble, Abeta in the aged rhesus monkey cerebral cortex results in profound
neuronal loss, tau phosphorylation and microglial proliferation. Fibrillar Abeta 
at plaque-equivalent concentrations is not toxic in the young adult rhesus brain.
Abeta toxicity in vivo is also highly species-specific; toxicity is greater in
aged rhesus monkeys than in aged marmoset monkeys, and is not significant in aged
rats. These results suggest that Abeta neurotoxicity in vivo is a pathological
response of the aging brain, which is most pronounced in higher order primates.
Thus, longevity may contribute to the unique susceptibility of humans to
Alzheimer's disease by rendering the brain vulnerable to Abeta neurotoxicity.

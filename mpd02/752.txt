In our previous study based on hsp60 PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism
and 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we stated that the bifidobacterial strains isolated
from the individual faecal samples of five baby common marmosets constituted
different phylogenetically isolated groups of the genus Bifidobacterium. In that 
study, we also proposed that these isolated groups potentially represented novel 
species of the genus Bifidobacterium. Out of them, Bifidobacterium aesculapii,
Bifidobacterium myosotis, Bifidobacterium tissieri and Bifidobacterium hapali,
have been described recently. Another strain, designated MRM 8.19T, has been
classified as member of the genus Bifidobacterium on the basis of positive
results for fructose-6-phosphate phosphoketolase activity and analysis of partial
16S rRNA, hsp60, clpC, dnaJ, dnaG and rpoB gene sequences. Analysis of 16S rRNA
and hsp60 gene sequences revealed that strain MRM 8.19T was related to B.
tissieri DSM 100201T (95.8 %) and to Bifidobacterium bifidum ATCC 29521T
(93.7 %), respectively. The DNA G+C composition was 63.7 mol% and the
peptidoglycan structure was l-Orn(Lys)-l-Ser. Based on the phylogenetic,
genotypic and phenotypic data reported, strain MRM 8.19T represents a novel taxon
within the genus Bifidobacterium for which the name Bifidobacterium catulorum sp.
nov. (type strain MRM 8.19T=DSM 103154T=JCM 31794T) is proposed.

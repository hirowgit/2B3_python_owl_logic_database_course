The reproductive patterns recorded in a free-ranging group of Callithrix
flaviceps were unique in a number of ways, including 4 females breeding
simultaneously, a non-breeding dominant female, and a well-defined birth season. 
In addition, all observed copulations involved extragroup individuals. The more
socially dominant breeding female had more births and more surviving offspring,
on average, than subordinate females, and was implicated in at least 1
infanticide. All 4 females carried their own infants for relatively long periods 
following the births, apparently as a defence mechanism related to the risk of
infanticide. It remains unclear whether the unusual number of breeding females in
the group represents a species-specific pattern, or the result of specific local 
circumstances.

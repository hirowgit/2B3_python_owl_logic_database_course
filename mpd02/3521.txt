Assessment of cage use by laboratory-bred common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus).

Ely A, Freer A, Windle C, Ridley RM.

The way in which breeding families of laboratory-born marmosets used the space
provided by their cages, and a small protruding 'veranda', was assessed in order 
to determine the popularity of the veranda as a form of environmental enrichment,
and the extent to which the marmosets confined themselves to only part of the
cage. The veranda was found to be of enduring interest to the marmosets whose
occupancy of this space was an order of magnitude greater than the rest of the
cage. The upper part of the cage was preferred to the bottom half. This
preference was greater in larger cages and decreased when larger cages were
temporarily reduced in size. It is unlikely, however, that the distribution of
the occupancy of different parts of the cage resulted primarily from a fear of
people in the holding room. The veranda, which was the most preferred place in
the cage, was the nearest part of the cage to people in the room. Occupancy of
the lower part of the cage increased when human observers sat on the floor,
suggesting that some of the marmosets' behaviour comprised approaching, rather
than avoiding, the observers, possibly for reasons of curiosity and social
interaction.

The genetic basis of red-green color vision of common marmoset (Callithrix
jacchus) is not fully understood. Here, we have cloned and characterized the
three alleles at a locus that encode the long to middle wavelength-sensitive
(LWS/MWS) visual pigments of this species. Using in situ hybridization, we
localized this locus to the telomeric region of the long arm of X chromosome. The
three visual pigments achieve the wavelengths of maximal absorption at 561, 553, 
and 539 nm and fully explain the red-green color vision of the common marmoset.
The 'tri-allelic single-locus X-chromosome' model operates under the unique
phenomenon, known as blood chimerism.

The birth of fraternal twins is a characteristic frequently observed in
callitrichids. Cytogenetic studies have demonstrated hematopoietic chimerism in
marmosets with the occurrence of two cell lines 2n=46,XX/46,XY in females and
males co-twins, without phenotypic changes. Amplification by PCR have also been
used to verify the presence of the SRY gene in female chimaeras. Our aim was to
verify the occurrence of chimerism in Callithrix sp. individuals considered as
hybrids according to their intermediate phenotypes between C. jacchus and C.
penicillata. Blood samples from 37 Callithrix sp. individuals were collected.
Hematopoietic chimerism 2n=46,XX/46,XY was detected by cytogenetic analysis in
five individuals, three males and two females. A fragment of approximately 200bp 
of the SRY gene was amplified in seven females with normal external genitalia.
The percentage of 32% of chimeric individuals detected in the present study is
similar to that observed for pure specimens of Callithrix. These data suggests
that hybridization probably does not interfere with the occurrence of twin
gestation, nor of chimerism. Although cytogenetics is the main tool to identify
the two cell lineages present in cases of chimerism, the amplification of the SRY
gene by PCR has proved to be more efficient to identify the Y chromosome in cases
of chimeric female marmoset.

Although the International Conference on Harmonization Guideline ICH M3 indicates
the use of nonrodents for some studies of pharmaceutical products, the specific
nonrodent species is not specified. Dogs are used most frequently; however, there
may be reasons why dogs are not the best model for a particular drug. Minipigs
are being used increasingly for evaluation of toxicity, especially for dermally
applied drugs, and for various efficacy models. Hamsters may be used for the
evaluation of intraoral drugs and for carcinogenicity studies. Less commonly,
pharmaceutical manufacturers may choose on their own to use marmosets, when a
nonhuman primate is considered critical to evaluation, or to use ferrets for
specific purposes. When nontraditional species are used, there may be less
historical information available and unique issues of their care, and differences
in physiology and anatomy and susceptibility to infection need to be understood. 
Nonmammalian test species, such as zebrafish and Caenorhabditis elegans may be
used by drug sponsors in screening assays, but are not yet ready for use in
pivotal toxicology studies because of the difficulty in extrapolating to
mammalian species. Use of nontraditional animal species may be proposed by a drug
sponsor to a reviewing division with supporting data and reasons for using a
particular species.

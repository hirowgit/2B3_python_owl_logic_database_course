Previous studies reported that Rho-associated kinase inhibitor Y27632 markedly
diminishes human embryonic stem cell and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)
dissociation-induced apoptosis and increases cloning efficiency in a feeder-free 
culture system. However, the mechanisms by which Y27632 protects pluripotent stem
cells from apoptosis remain unknown. In the present study, we tested the effects 
of Y27632 on single dissociated marmoset iPSCs in a feeder-free culture. The
results showed that Y27632 promoted the number of cells proliferating after
passage by single-cell dissociation in a dose-dependent manner. The
Rho-associated kinase inhibitor Y27632 markedly increased the cloning efficiency 
of marmoset iPSCs without affecting their karyotype and the expression of
pluripotency markers. Meanwhile, Y27632 markedly diminished apoptosis of the
marmoset iPSCs under even more severe conditions by suppressing the expression
and activity of caspase 3. Taken together, the present results suggest that this 
reagent is effective in improving the cultural system of primate iPSCs.

The localization and fine structure of C-cells of the thyroid glands from 31
marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) of different age groups (newborn to 11 years old) 
were investigated by electron microscopy and immunomorphology (APAAP,
calcitonin). Calcitonin-positive cells were found concentrated in the middle
third of the gland. Their localization in the follicular wall or in the
interstitial space could not clearly be demonstrated by light microscopy. In
adult animals, they were always located within the basal lamina, as revealed by
electron microscopy. In newborn animals, their localization was difficult because
of the dense cell packing. The fine structure of the C-cells with their 200 nm
electron-dense granules corresponded to that of other species. Two cell types
could be distinguished: (1) granule-rich cells in the storing phase and (2) cells
with fewer granules and well-developed rough endoplasmic reticulum in the
synthesis phase. The concentration of C-cells in the middle third of the marmoset
thyroid gland renders this species especially suitable for morphological
investigations and in vitro experiments.

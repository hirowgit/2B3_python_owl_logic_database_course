Engaging and disengaging recurrent inhibition coincides with sensing and
unsensing of a sensory stimulus.

Even simple sensory stimuli evoke neural responses that are dynamic and complex. 
Are the temporally patterned neural activities important for controlling the
behavioral output? Here, we investigated this issue. Our results reveal that in
the insect antennal lobe, due to circuit interactions, distinct neural ensembles 
are activated during and immediately following the termination of every odorant. 
Such non-overlapping response patterns are not observed even when the stimulus
intensity or identities were changed. In addition, we find that ON and OFF
ensemble neural activities differ in their ability to recruit recurrent
inhibition, entrain field-potential oscillations and more importantly in their
relevance to behaviour (initiate versus reset conditioned responses). Notably, we
find that a strikingly similar strategy is also used for encoding sound onsets
and offsets in the marmoset auditory cortex. In sum, our results suggest a
general approach where recurrent inhibition is associated with stimulus
'recognition' and 'derecognition'.

The study of local ecological knowledge (LEK) fosters a better understanding of
the relationship between humans and the environment. We assessed respondents'
ecological knowledge of primates in a rural community located near the Atlantic
Forest remnants in the state of Paraíba, Brazil. Populations of Alouatta belzebul
(red-handed howler monkeys), Sapajus flavius (blonde capuchins), and Callithrix
jacchus (the common marmoset) inhabit the region. We conducted 200
semi-structured interviews and applied thematic content analysis, with weighting,
to the responses to quantify the LEK. Respondents showed a low LEK, despite the
community's proximity to forest remnants. However, the LEK was significantly
higher among men, as well as among those who had a greater degree of contact with
the primates. Age did not influence LEK. The studied community apparently does
not intensively exploit the forest resources nor does it economically depend on
primates, which may explain these individuals' low levels of knowledge about
these animals. Such data may support future studies, as well as environmental
education and action plans, especially for A. belzebul and S. flavius, both of
which are endangered species and targets of the National Action Plan for the
Conservation of the Primates of the Northeast.

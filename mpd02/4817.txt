Miraglia T, Moura CS, Chezzi LA.

The gastric mucosa of marmosets is devoid of UDPG-GT; phosphorylases; G-6-PA;
F-1,6-PA; alanyl aminopeptidase and leucine aminopeptidase. Only the acid
phosphatase was seen with a stronger reactivity in the chief cells. The other
enzymes (LDH; G-6-PDH; 6-PGDH; NADPH2-TR; cis-aconitase; ICDH; SDH; MDH;
cytochrome oxidase; NADH2-TR; a-GPDH; b-OHBDH and nonspecific esterase) showed a 
stronger reactivity in the parietal cells.

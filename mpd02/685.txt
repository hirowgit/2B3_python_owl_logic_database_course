In the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) several factors within the macular
compared to peripheral regions cause differences in physiological aging. The
molecular mechanisms during aging in the context of topography are not well
known. The proteome of RPE of different aged macular-bearing primates Callithrix 
jacchus was thus analysed with ion mobility mass spectrometry. Macular and
periphery of neonate RPE were well differentiated from aged tissues as
demonstrated by principal component analysis. This finding was mainly due to
proteins involved in major developmental processes and the visual cycle. The
distinction of adult from senile tissue and macular from periphery was more
subtle. The hypotheses of inflammation increasing with age was supported. High
expression levels of proteins related to oxidative stress (e.g., cathepsin B) and
chaperones (e.g., HSP90) were detected in aged RPE as confirmed by Western blot
and immunohistochemical analysis. Decreased levels of proteins participating in
angiostatic properties (e.g., thrombospondin 1) and the integrity of tissue
basement membranes with age (e.g., nidogen 1) were in agreement with
neovascularization. This study presents targets for further investigations of the
mechanisms of the aging process with the aim to elucidate predictive factors for 
the conversion of physiological aging into pathological conditions. SIGNIFICANCE:
The current study characterized the different protein profiles of the retinal
pigment epithelium (RPE) of the macula-bearing, non-human primate Callithrix
jacchus during life-time. In addition, the subproteomes of macular and peripheral
RPE were investigated. Differently expressed proteins described developmental
processes in neonate tissue and destructive mechanisms in aged samples. Insights 
into the physiological aging process of the RPE and its conversion into
pathophysiological conditions were gained. They assist in designing therapeutical
approaches to counteract age-related diseases of the retina.

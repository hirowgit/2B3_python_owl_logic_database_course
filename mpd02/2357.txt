In rodents, the expression of a reward-conditioned place preference (CPP) is
regulated in a circadian pattern such that the preference is exhibited strongly
at the circadian time of prior training but not at other circadian times. Because
each animal is trained only at a single circadian phase, the concept of time as a
context cue is derived from a rhythmic internal state rather than learned
explicitly from the external cues. We now report that the same "time memory" is
expressed following context conditioning in the common marmoset (Callithrix
jacchus). Animals were trained at a specific time to discriminate between an
unpaired context and a context paired with food reward. Marmosets were then
tested for preference at circadian times that were either the same or different
from the training time. Preference was expressed only when training and testing
times matched. The results show that time of day learning can be generalized to
this new world primate implying that a similar circadian mechanism might regulate
craving for reward in diverse mammals including human beings.

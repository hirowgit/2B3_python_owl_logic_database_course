The corpus luteum (CL) is a transient endocrine organ, yet molecular mechanisms
resulting in its demise are not well known. The presence of phosphorylated mixed 
lineage kinase domain-like pseudokinase pMLKL(T357/S358) in human and nonhuman
primate CL samples (Macaca mulatta and Callithrix jacchus) implied that
necroptosis of luteal cells may be involved. In M. mulatta CL, pMLKL positive
staining became detectable only from the mid-late luteal phase onwards, pointing 
to necroptosis during regression of the CL. Cell death, including necroptosis,
was previously observed in cultures of human luteal granulosa cells (GCs), an apt
model for the study of the human CL. To explore mechanisms of necroptotic cell
death in GCs during culture, we performed a proteomic analysis. The levels of 50 
proteins were significantly altered after 5 days of culture. Interconnectivity
analysis and immunocytochemistry implicated specifically the ceramide salvage
pathway to be enhanced. M. mulatta CL transcriptome analysis indicated in vivo
relevance. Perturbing endogenous ceramide generation by fumonisin B1 (FB1) and
addition of soluble ceramide (C2-CER) yielded opposite actions on viability of
GCs and therefore supported the significance of the ceramide pathway.
Morphological changes indicated necrotic cell death in the C2-CER treated group. 
Studies with the pan caspase blocker zVAD-fmk or the necroptosis blocker
necrosulfonamid (NSA) further supported that C2-CER induced necroptosis. Our data
pinpoint necroptosis in a physiological process, namely CL regression. This
raises the possibility that the primate CL could be rescued by pharmacological
inhibition of necroptosis or by interaction with ceramide metabolism.

In New World monkeys of the family Callitrichidae (marmosets and tamarins),
females frequently give birth to dizygotic twins. Twins share a placental
circulation throughout fetal development and are hemopoietic chimeras. Despite
this, there is no masculinization (freemartinism) in females which develop next
to a male co-twin. It has been suggested that the organizing effects of
testicular androgen upon sexual differentiation of the brain occur mainly during 
early postnatal development in male callitrichids, rather than in utero. However,
this report demonstrates activation of masculine copulatory behavior by
testosterone propionate (TP) administered to adult male marmosets (N = 8) which
were castrated in infancy (between Days 1-7). Effects of neonatal castration upon
aggressive behavior during pair tests with females (high frequencies of
aggression) and intact adult males (low frequencies of aggression) were also
reversed by TP treatment in adulthood. While early postnatal androgen secretion
plays an important role in behavioral development in marmosets, it appears that a
substantial degree of neural sexual differentiation occurs in utero in males of
this callitrichid species.

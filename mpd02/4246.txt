Herpesvirus saimiri (HVS) is one of several primate viruses that carry genes for 
small RNAs. The five H. saimiri-encoded U RNAs (HSURs) are the most abundant
viral transcripts expressed in transformed marmoset T lymphocytes. They assemble 
with host proteins common to spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoproteins
(snRNPs). HSURs 1, 2, and 5 exhibit sequences at their 5' ends identical to the
AUUUA motif, which targets a number of protooncogene, cytokine, and lymphokine
mRNAs for rapid degradation. We show that a 32-kDa protein previously
demonstrated to bind to the 3' untranslated region of several unstable messages
can be UV crosslinked specifically to HSUR 1, 2, and 5 transcripts in vitro, as
well as to endogenous HSUR snRNPs. Our results suggest an unusual role for these 
viral snRNPs: HSURs may function to attenuate the rapid degradation of certain
cellular mRNAs, thereby facilitating viral transformation of host T lymphocytes.

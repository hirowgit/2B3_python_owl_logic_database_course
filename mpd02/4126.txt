Vasopressin and in particular its structural analogue dDAVP
(1-deamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin) can increase plasma concentrations of Factor
VIII and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) in some species of animals and in
humans. For this reason dDAVP is used therapeutically in the treatment of
bleeding episodes in patients suffering from haemophilia A and Von Willebrand's
disease. However, the high antidiuretic activity of dDAVP constitutes and
unwanted effect in this context. In the present study, a large number of
analogues of vasopressin were designed, synthesized and tested in monkeys with
the aim of producing compounds in which the Factor VIII-releasing activity was
selectively isolated from the vasopressor and antidiuretic actions of the
peptide. The results indicate that it is possible to separate these biological
activities; however, none of the analogues tested so far possessed Factor VIII
potencies comparable to that of dDAVP.

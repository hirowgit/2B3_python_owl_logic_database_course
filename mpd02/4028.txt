An automated device is described to test the exploratory and motor activity of
common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus). The device consists of four boxes
interconnected by PVC tubes. The presence of an animal in a box is detected by a 
photocell. Calibration takes place with an electric model train. Movements of the
animal from one box to another are detected by disappearance from one and
appearance in another box. The apparatus is linked to a PC. The effects of two
doses of methamphetamine and of pentobarbital are shown.

Common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is emerging as a clinically relevant
nonhuman primate model for various diseases, but is hindered by the availability 
of marmoset cell lines, which are critical for understanding the disease
pathogenesis and drug/toxicological screening prior to animal testing. Here we
describe the generation of immortalized marmoset hepatic progenitor cells (MHPCs)
by lentivirus-mediated transfer of the simian virus 40 large T antigen gene in
fetal liver polygonal cells. MHPCs proliferate indefinitely in vitro without
chromosomal alteration and telomere shortening. These cells possess hepatic
progenitor cell-specific gene expression profiles with potential to differentiate
into both hepatocytic and cholangiocytic lineages in vitro and in vivo and also
can be genetically modified. Importantly, injected MHPCs repopulated the injured 
liver of fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (Fah)-deficient mice with hepatocyte-like 
cells. MHPCs also engraft as cholangiocytes into bile ducts of
3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine (DDC)-induced bile ductular injured
mice. MHPCs provide a tool to enable efficient derivation and genetic
modification of both hepatocytes and cholangiocytes for use in disease modeling, 
tissue engineering, and drug screening.

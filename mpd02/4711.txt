Craniofacial growth in young marmosets (Callithrix jacchus).

Goss AN, White J, Townsend GC.

A cross-sectional study of craniofacial growth in young marmosets was performed. 
Selected linear craniofacial measurements were obtained from groups of 5 animals 
of each sex at 3 monthly intervals from birth to 1 year. These data provide a
baseline for comparison with other colonies and in the assessment of teratogens
on craniofacial development.

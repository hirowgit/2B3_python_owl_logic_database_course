A putative non-cholinergic mechanism in urinary bladders of New but not Old World
primates.

Craggs MD, Rushton DN, Stephenson JD.

The effects of atropine on bladder contractions evoked by sacral ventral root
stimulation were investigated in two species of New World monkey (marmoset and
cebus) and in paraplegic man. The findings were then compared to those previously
obtained for the cat and two species of Old World monkey (rhesus and baboon). The
results show the marmoset and cebus to represent a transitional stage between the
complete sensitivity of the bladders of Old World monkeys to atropine and the
relative insensitivity of the cat bladder. The bladder response is shown to
comprise two components, an atropine sensitive component which is slow in onset
and an atropine resistant component which is easily fatigued. The experiments in 
paraplegic people confirm that the parasympathetic innervation of the bladder of 
man is, like that of Old World monkeys, exclusively cholinergic. A behavioural
interpretation is tentatively offered to explain the two types of innervation.

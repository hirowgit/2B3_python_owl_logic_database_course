To investigate lymphoid cell Hantavirus (HV) interaction, we examined the
replication of the HV strains, Hantaan 76-118 (HTN), SR-11, and B-1 with the
B95a, LYM-1, CGM1, JM, Jurkat, MOLT-4, AT(L)5KY, BW5147, L1210, and Vero/E6
cells. HV-growth was determined by immunofluorescence and focus-forming assays.
LYM-1 and Vero/E6 supported the growth of all HV strains, and B95a only HTN,
while remaining cells did not sustain these strains. This is the first report to 
indicate the HV-replication in lymphoid cell lines. B95a and LYM-1 cells may be
useful for revealing the mechanism of HV-infection in animals.

Distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) were measured in a New World
primate, the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). We determined the optimal
primary-tone frequency ratio (f(2)/f(1)) to generate DPOAEs of maximal amplitude 
between 3 and 24 kHz. The optimal f(2)/f(1), determined by varying f(2)/f(1) from
1.02 to 1.40 using equilevel primary tones, decreased with increasing f(2)
frequency between 3 and 17 kHz, and increased at 24 kHz. The optimal f(2)/f(1)
ratio increased with increasing primary-tone levels from 50 to 74 dB SPL. When
all stimulus parameters were considered, the mean optimal f(2)/f(1) was
1.224-1.226. Additionally, we determined the effect of reducing L(2) below L(1). 
Decreasing L(2) below L(1) by 0, 5, and 10 dB (f(2)/f(1)=1.21) minimally affected
DPOAE strength. DPOAE levels were stronger in females than males and stronger in 
the right ear than the left, just as in humans. This study is the first to
measure OAEs in the marmoset, and the results indicate that the effect of varying
the frequency ratio and primary-tone level difference on marmoset DPOAEs is
similar to the reported effects in humans and Old World primates.

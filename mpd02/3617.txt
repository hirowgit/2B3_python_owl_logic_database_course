Ultrasonography was used in six saddle back tamarin females (Saguinus
fuscicollis) to diagnose pregnancy, monitor the patterns of uterine growth and
embryonic/foetal development and examine the incidence loss of single
embryos/foetuses. Pregnancy was reliably diagnosed 17 days after conception, 10
days earlier than by plasma progesterone measurement. The patterns of uterine and
embryonic/foetal growth paralleled those reported for the common marmoset,
including a delay in embryonic development. The results support the hypothesis of
retardation of organogenesis in most callitrichid species. Individual embryos
could be reliably identified from day 50 of pregnancy; a loss of single
embryos/foetuses after this stage did not occur. All pregnancies were carried to 
term, resulting in five times twins and one singleton. The smaller litter size
compared to the common marmoset may be due to loss of single embryos at earlier
stages of pregnancy or to a lower ovulation rate.

We measured responses to red-green color variation in parvocellular (PC) neurons 
in the lateral geniculate nucleus of dichromatic ("red-green color blind")
marmoset monkeys. Although these animals lack distinct visual pigments to
distinguish between wavelengths in this range, many of the colored stimuli
nevertheless produced robust responses in PC cells. We show that these responses,
which are restricted to high stimulus spatial frequencies (fine image details),
arise from chromatic aberrations in the eye. The neural signals produced by
chromatic aberrations are of comparable magnitude to signals produced by
high-frequency luminance (LUM) modulation and thus could influence cortical
pathways for processing of color and object recognition. The fact that
genetically "color-blind" primates are not necessarily blind to
wavelength-dependent contours in the visual world may have enabled red-green
color vision to become linked with high-acuity spatial vision during primate
evolution.

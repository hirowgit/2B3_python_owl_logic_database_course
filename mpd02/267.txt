Cortical lesions are a primary driver of disability in multiple sclerosis (MS).
However, noninvasive detection of cortical lesions with in vivo magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) remains challenging. Experimental autoimmune
encephalomyelitis (EAE) in the common marmoset is a relevant animal model of MS
for investigating the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to brain damage. This
study aimed to characterize cortical lesions in marmosets with EAE using
ultrahigh-field (7 T) MRI and histological analysis. Tissue preparation was
optimized to enable the acquisition of high-spatial resolution (50-μm isotropic) 
T2*-weighted images. A total of 14 animals were scanned in this study, and 70% of
the diseased animals presented at least one cortical lesion on postmortem
imaging. Cortical lesions identified on MRI were verified with myelin proteolipid
protein immunostaining. An optimized T2*-weighted sequence was developed for in
vivo imaging and shown to capture 65% of cortical lesions detected postmortem.
Immunostaining confirmed extensive demyelination with preserved neuronal somata
in several cortical areas of EAE animals. Overall, this study demonstrates the
relevance and feasibility of the marmoset EAE model to study cortical lesions,
among the most important yet least understood features of MS.

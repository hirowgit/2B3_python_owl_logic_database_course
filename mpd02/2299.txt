A fundamental feature of auditory perception is the constancy of sound
recognition over a large range of intensities. Although this invariance has been 
described in behavioral studies, the underlying neural mechanism is essentially
unknown. Here we show a putative level-invariant representation of sounds by
populations of neurons in primary auditory cortex (A1) that may provide a neural 
basis for the behavioral observations. Previous studies reported that pure-tone
frequency tuning of most A1 neurons widens with increasing sound level. In sharp 
contrast, we found that a large proportion of neurons in A1 of awake marmosets
were narrowly and separably tuned to both frequency and sound level. Tuning
characteristics and firing rates of the neural population were preserved across
all tested sound levels. These response properties lead to a level-invariant
representation of sounds over the population of A1 neurons. Such a representation
is an important step for robust feature recognition in natural environments.

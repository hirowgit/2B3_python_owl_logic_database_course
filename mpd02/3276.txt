CXCR4 gene homologues were isolated from an ape (gibbon), an Old World monkey
(African green monkey), and two New World monkeys (squirrel monkey and cotton-top
marmoset), and their DNA sequences determined. The squirrel monkey and cotton-top
marmoset CXCR4 sequences more closely resemble homologues from apes than Old
World monkeys, a pattern not seen for the related chemokine receptor CCR5. The
African green monkey CXCR4 gene is similar to its homologue in baboon, a pattern 
that has also been seen among CCR5 homologues. The gibbon CXCR4 contains the
first polymorphisms recognized in ape homologues, the human and chimpanzee CXCR4 
proteins being identical, and two of these three differences are also observed in
one or more Old World monkey homologues. While 18 positions within CXCR4 are now 
known to be polymorphic in primates, 7 of these polymorphisms have been observed 
in multiple examples and 11 have been observed only once.

Encapsulation of stem cells in alginate beads is promising as a sophisticated
drug delivery system in treatment of a wide range of acute and chronic diseases. 
However, common use of air flow encapsulation of cells in alginate beads fails to
produce beads with narrow size distribution, intact spherical structure and
controllable sizes that can be scaled up. Here we show that high voltage
encapsulation (≥ 15 kV) can be used to reproducibly generate spherical alginate
beads (200-400 μm) with narrow size distribution (± 5-7%) in a controlled manner 
under optimized process parameters. Flow rate of alginate solution ranged from
0.5 to 10 ml/h allowed producing alginate beads with a size of 320 and 350 μm
respectively, suggesting that this approach can be scaled up. Moreover, we found 
that applied voltages (15-25 kV) did not alter the viability and proliferation of
encapsulated mesenchymal stem cells post-encapsulation and cryopreservation as
compared to air flow. We are the first who employed a comparative analysis of
electro-spraying and air flow encapsulation to study the effect of high voltage
on alginate encapsulated cells. This report provides background in application of
high voltage to encapsulate living cells for further medical purposes. Long-term 
comparison and work on alginate-cell interaction within these structures will be 
forthcoming.

A pregnant common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) showed tachypnea, hypothermia,
and anorexia at close to the expected delivery date. Severe anemia and
thrombocytopenia, schistocytes, and high levels of LDH and D-dimer were observed.
Three days after the onset of clinical signs, a cesarean section was conducted
due to stillbirth. Marmoset immediately recovered after surgery, and the abnormal
CBC and blood chemistry parameters before surgery returned to the normal ranges. 
Diagnosis of pregnancy-associated thrombotic microangiopathy was made because
removal of infant and placenta is curative. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first case report of thrombotic microangiopathy in a marmoset with
preeclampsia.

Plasmodium knowlesi malaria is a newly described zoonosis in Southeast Asia.
Similarly to Plasmodium falciparum, P. knowlesi can reach high parasitaemia in
the human host and both species cause severe and fatal illness. Interpretation of
host-parasite interactions in studies of P. knowlesi malaria adds a counterpoint 
to studies on P. falciparum. However, there is no model system for testing the
resulting hypotheses on malaria pathophysiology or for developing new
interventions. Plasmodium knowlesi is amenable to genetic manipulation in vitro
and several nonhuman primate species are susceptible to experimental infection.
Here, we make a case for drawing on P. knowlesi as both a human pathogen and an
experimental model to lift the roadblock between malaria research and its
translation into human health benefits.

Plasma prolactin concentrations during the ovarian cycle and lactation and their 
relationship to return of fertility post partum in the common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus).

A heterologous double-antibody radioimmunoassay was used to measure plasma
prolactin concentrations in 27 marmosets. The assay was valid for the marmoset
because plasma levels of prolactin were increased in response to TRH and
metoclopramide and suppressed in response to bromocriptine treatment. During the 
cycle there were no consistent changes in plasma prolactin concentrations. During
lactation mothers suckling single or twin infants had higher prolactin levels
than did non-suckling females and levels were highest with twins. No
statistically significant delay in the resumption of ovulation post partum was
observed for the suckling and non-suckling females; conception occurred in all
but one marmoset by 70 days post partum. These results show that neither the
suckling stimulus nor high levels of prolactin post partum delay the return of
ovulation and fertility in the common marmoset, a result in contrast to that for 
all other primate species so far investigated.

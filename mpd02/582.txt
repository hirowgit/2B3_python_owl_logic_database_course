1. Propafenone, an antiarrhythmic drug, is a typical human cytochrome P450 (P450)
2D6 substrate used in preclinical studies. Here, propafenone oxidation by
mammalian liver microsomes was investigated in vitro. 2. Liver microsomes from
humans and marmosets preferentially mediated propafenone 5-hydroxylation,
minipig, rat and mouse livers primarily mediated 4'-hydroxylation, but cynomolgus
monkey and dog liver microsomes differently mediated N-despropylation. 3.
Quinine, ketoconazole or anti-P450 2D antibodies suppressed propafenone
4'/5-hydroxylation in human and rat liver microsomes. Pretreatments with
Î²-naphthoflavone or dexamethasone increased N-despropylation in rat livers. 4.
Recombinant rat P450 2D2 efficiently catalysed propafenone 4'-hydroxylation in a 
substrate inhibition manner, comparable to rat liver microsomes, while human P450
2D6 displayed propafenone 5-hydroxylation. Human and rat P450 1A, 2C and 3A
enzymes mediated propafenone N-despropylation with high capacities. 5. Carbon-4' 
of propafenone docked favourably into the active site of P450 2D2 based on an in 
silico model; in contrast, carbon-5 of propafenone docked into human P450 2D6. 6.
These results suggest that the major roles of individual P450 2D enzymes in
regioselective hydroxylations of propafenone differ between human and rat livers,
while the minor roles of P450 1A, 2C and 3A enzymes for propafenone
N-despropylation are similar in livers of both species.

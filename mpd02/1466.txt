The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a small New World primate; it
originally comes from the Atlantic coastal forests in northeastern Brazil. It has
been attracting much attention in the biomedical research field because of its
size, availability, and unique biological characteristics. Its endocrinological
and behavioral similarity to humans, comparative ease in handling, and high
reproductive efficiency are very advantageous for neuroscience research.
Recently, we developed transgenic common marmosets with germline transmission,
and this technological breakthrough provides a potential paradigm shift by
enabling researchers to investigate complex biological phenomena using
genetically-modified non-human primates. In this review, we summarize recent
progress in marmoset research, and also discuss a potential application of genome
editing tools that should be useful toward the generation of knock-out/knock-in
marmoset models.

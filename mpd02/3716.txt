Brain-stem auditory evoked potentials (BAEPs) were recorded in 10 common
marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) to investigate the effects of recording electrode 
configurations, stimulus rate, and stimulus frequency on BAEP wave forms and peak
latencies. Tone burst stimulations were used to evaluate the effects of pure tone
on BAEP wave forms. Five positive peaks superimposed on positive and negative
slow potentials were identified in the BAEP recorded at the linkage between the
vertex and the dorsal base of the ear ipsilateral to a monaural stimulus. When
the reference electrode was placed at the ipsilateral mastoid or the neck, the
amplitudes of positive and negative slow potentials and the incidence of wave I
increased. There were no significant changes in peak latencies of BAEP waves with
changes in stimulus rate from 5 to 20/s. It was possible to record the BAEPs in
response to tone burst stimulations at frequencies extending from 0.5 to 99 kHz. 
Wave I appeared apparently at high stimulus frequencies; while waves III to V, at
low frequencies. Wave II was recorded at frequencies ranging from 0.5 to 99 kHz
and comprised a superposition of 2 or 3 potentials.

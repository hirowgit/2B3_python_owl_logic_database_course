The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the localization of collagen types
IV, V and VI as well as the glycoprotein laminin in biopsies of healthy rat,
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) and human gingivae. The slices, after the use of
indirect immunofluorescence (incubation with antibodies against these
extracellular matrix components), showed the same distribution with the anti-type
IV and laminin antibodies on the basement membranes of the epithelium, blood
vessels and nerves. Collagen type V, as a filamentous, and collagen type VI, as
microfibrillar components, were localized in a similar pattern in the different
species. In contrast to the other species, collagen type VI could not be found
near the basement membranes of vessels and nerves of the marmoset gingiva. This
result shows differences between human and monkey tissues, but not between rat
and human gingivae, and conforms the heterogeneity of collagen type VI in the
various cell and tissue types.

Conventional methods of capturing marmosets and other small nonhuman primates
(NHPs) require prolonged physical contact between animals and their handlers.
This causes NHPs to become stressed and exhausted and can put both animals and
handlers at risk of injury or exposure to infectious diseases. The authors
designed a self-contained device for the capture and transport of small NHPs.
Food rewards encourage primates to enter the device independently, and handlers
can then easily access the animals for routine veterinary or experimental
procedures. Preliminary observations suggest that marmosets quickly become
accustomed to the device and that the device causes less stress than capture by
hand or by net.

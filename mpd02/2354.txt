Fatty acids in milk reflect the interplay between species-specific physiological 
mechanisms and maternal diet. Anthropoid primates (apes, Old and New World
monkeys) vary in patterns of growth and development and dietary strategies. Milk 
fatty acid profiles also are predicted to vary widely. This study investigates
milk fatty acid composition of five wild anthropoids (Alouatta palliata,
Callithrix jacchus, Gorilla beringei beringei, Leontopithecus rosalia, Macaca
sinica) to test the null hypothesis of a generalized anthropoid milk fatty acid
composition. Milk from New and Old World monkeys had significantly more 8:0 and
10:0 than milk from apes. The leaf eating species G. b. beringei and A. paliatta 
had a significantly higher proportion of milk 18:3n-3, a fatty acid found
primarily in plant lipids. Mean percent composition of 22:6n-3 was significantly 
different among monkeys and apes, but was similar to the lowest reported values
for human milk. Mountain gorillas were unique among anthropoids in the high
proportion of milk 20:4n-6. This seems to be unrelated to requirements of a
larger brain and may instead reflect species-specific metabolic processes or an
unknown source of this fatty acid in the mountain gorilla diet.

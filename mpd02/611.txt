Primate cortical evolution has been characterized by massive and disproportionate
expansion of a set of specific regions in the neocortex. The associated increase 
in neocortical neurons comes with a high metabolic cost, thus the functions
served by these regions must have conferred significant evolutionary advantage.
In the present series of analyses, we show that evolutionary high-expanding
cortex - as estimated from patterns of surface growth from several primate
species - shares functional connections with different brain networks in a
context-dependent manner. Specifically, we demonstrate that high-expanding cortex
is characterized by high internetwork functional connectivity; is recruited
flexibly over many different cognitive tasks; and changes its functional coupling
pattern between rest and a multimodal task-state. The capacity of high-expanding 
cortex to connect flexibly with various specialized brain networks depending on
particular cognitive requirements suggests that its selective growth and
sustainment in evolution may have been linked to an involvement in supramodal
cognition. In accordance with an evolutionary-developmental view, we find that
this observed ability of high-expanding regions - to flexibly modulate functional
connections as a function of cognitive state - emerges gradually through
childhood, with a prolonged developmental trajectory plateauing in young
adulthood.

Callitrichids, South American primates including marmosets and tamarins, have
evolved a unique physiology. Twins share a placenta during gestation and exchange
stem cells, resulting in naturally occurring chimeric adults. Our study used a
quantitative PCR-based assay to address whether this chimerism was restricted to 
blood and other cells of the hematopoietic lineage or whether it extended to
other somatic tissues. These studies help to characterize species that have
adapted evolutionarily to pervasive chimerism, with every individual healthy and 
unperturbed. This experiment of evolution offers insight into transplantation and
histocompatibility, reproductive biology and behavior, and innate and adaptive
immunity.

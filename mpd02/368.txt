Accumulating evidence suggests that dysregulation of placental DNA methylation
(DNAm) is a mechanism linking maternal weight during pregnancy to metabolic
programming outcomes. The common marmoset, Callithrix jaccus, is a platyrrhine
primate species that has provided much insight into studies of the primate
placenta, maternal condition, and metabolic programming, yet the relationships
between maternal weight and placental DNAm are unknown. Here, we report
genome-wide DNAm from term marmoset placentas using reduced representation
bisulfite sequencing. We identified 74 genes whose DNAm pattern is associated
with maternal weight during gestation. These genes are predominantly involved in 
energy metabolism and homeostasis, including the regulation of glycolytic and
lipid metabolic processes pathways.

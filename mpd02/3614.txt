Mutant forms of herpesvirus saimiri (HVS) subgroup C strain 488 with deletions in
either STP-C488 or Tip were constructed. The transforming potentials of the HVS
mutants were tested in cell culture and in common marmosets. Parental HVS
subgroup C strain 488 immortalized common marmoset T lymphocytes in vitro to
interleukin-2-independent growth, but neither of the deletion mutants produced
such growth transformation. Wild-type HVS produced fatal lymphoma within 19 to 20
days of experimental infection of common marmosets, while HVS deltaSTP-C488 and
HVS deltaTip were nononcogenic. Virus was repeatedly isolated from the peripheral
blood of marmosets infected with mutant virus for more than 5 months. These
results demonstrate that STP-C488 and Tip are not required for replication or
persistence, but each is essential for transformation in cell culture and for
lymphoma induction in common marmosets.

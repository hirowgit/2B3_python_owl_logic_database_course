The rapid, controlled and cyclical nature of angiogenesis in the female
reproductive tract suggests that interference with this process should provide a 
novel approach to manipulation of reproductive function. Many factors involved in
the regulation of angiogenesis have been identified, and the possibility of
stimulating or inhibiting these paracrine control mechanisms is being addressed
using current advances in the development of angiogenic and anti-angiogenic
compounds. Studies with animal models indicate that the normal processes of
folliculogenesis, ovulation and corpus luteum function in the ovary, and the
control of menstruation and implantation in the endometrium could be profoundly
influenced by manipulation of angiogenesis. Novel therapeutic agents targeted to 
the angiogenic pathway may also have a wide range of applications in pathological
processes in the reproductive tract such as cancer, endometriosis, fibroid
growth, and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome.

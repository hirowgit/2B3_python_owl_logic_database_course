A positive feedback effect of oestradiol on LH release in the male marmoset
monkey, Callithrix jacchus.

Hodges JK, Hearn JP.

Subcutaneous injections of oestradiol benzoate in oil, resulting in a sustained
elevation of circulating oestradiol levels, induced an initial suppression of LH 
secretion, followed by a positive discharge of LH in castrated male and female
and in intact male marmosets. Oestrogen-induced LH release (producing maximum LH 
concentrations 24 h after the injection) was observed in 75% of castrated males
and females. A positive discharge of LH occurred in 50% of intact males 28-36 h
after oestrogen administration.

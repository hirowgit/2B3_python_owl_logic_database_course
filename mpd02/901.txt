The circadian timing system (CTS) anticipates optimal physiological patterns in
response to environmental fluctuations, such as light-dark cycle. Since
age-related disruption of circadian synchronization is linked to several
pathological conditions, we characterized alterations of neurochemical
constituents and retinal projections to the major pacemaker of CTS, the
suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), in adult and aged marmosets. We used intraocular
injections of neural tracer Cholera toxin b (CTb) to report age-related
reductions in CTb, neuropeptide Y and serotonin immunoreactivities. Considering
these projections arise in SCN from nuclei that relay environmental information
to entrain the circadian clock, we provide important anatomical correlates to
age-associated physiological deficits.

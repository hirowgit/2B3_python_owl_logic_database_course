The palmaris longus is considered a phylogenetic degenerate metacarpophalangeal
joint flexor muscle in humans, a small vestigial forearm muscle; it is the most
variable muscle in humans, showing variation in position, duplication, slips and 
could be reverted. It is frequently studied in papers about human anatomical
variations in cadavers and in vivo, its variation has importance in medical
clinic, surgery, radiological analysis, in studies about high-performance
athletes, in genetics and anthropologic studies. Most studies about palmaris
longus in humans are associated to frequency or case studies, but comparative
anatomy in primates and comparative morphometry were not found in scientific
literature. Comparative anatomy associated to morphometry of palmaris longus
could explain the degeneration observed in this muscle in two of three of the
great apes. Hypothetically, the comparison of the relative length of tendons and 
belly could indicate the pathway of the degeneration of this muscle, that is, the
degeneration could be associated to increased tendon length and decreased belly
from more primitive primates to those most derivate, that is, great apes to
modern humans. In conclusion, in primates, the tendon of the palmaris longus
increase from Lemuriformes to modern humans, that is, from arboreal to
terrestrial primates and the muscle became weaker and tending to be missing.

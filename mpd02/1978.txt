Aging societies face an increasing prevalence of neurodegenerative disorders for 
which no cure exists. The paucity of relevant animal models that faithfully
reproduce clinical and pathogenic features of neurodegenerative diseases is a
major cause for the lack of effective therapies. Clinically distinct disorders,
such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, are driven by overlapping pathogenic
mechanisms that converge onto vulnerable neurons to ultimately cause abnormal
clinical outcomes. These similarities, particularly in the early phases of
neurodegeneration, might help identify appropriate animal model systems for
studying of cell pathology. While reviewing some of the cellular mechanisms of
disease progression, we discuss the MPTP-induced model of Parkinsonism in
marmoset monkeys as a model system for construct, face and predictive validity in
neurodegenerative studies.

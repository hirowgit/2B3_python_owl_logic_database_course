BACKGROUND: As common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) are frequently used
experimental animals, sensitive test systems are needed to evaluate impairment
and pain caused by procedures and diseases.
METHODS: A diurnal profile of healthy animals was obtained by videotaping.
Differences in social behavior and cognitive skills between marmosets with
established endometriosis and healthy monkeys were investigated using the
videotaping, the Wisconsin General Test Apparatus (WGTA), and a food tree.
RESULTS: The marmosets showed a mostly trimodal course of activity. Social
grooming and activity were significantly decreased in animals with endometriosis;
furthermore, the diseased monkeys habituated significantly worse to the cognitive
test settings. The food tree experiments offered no differences between diseased 
and control animals.
CONCLUSION: The videotaping and the WGTA are suitable methods to detect
disease-related impairments in common marmosets, which is essential for the
refinement of experiments.

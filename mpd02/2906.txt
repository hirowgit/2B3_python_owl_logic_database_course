Five young adult pet marmosets (Callithrix spp.) were presented with weight loss 
(5/5); fecal retention (3/5); diarrhea (2/5); impaired locomotion (3/5); anemia
(4/4); hypoproteinemia or hypoalbuminemia (3/4); elevations of creatine
phosphokinase, lactic dehydrogenase, and alanine aminotransferase (3/4); and
renal failure with hypercholesterolemia (2/4). All anemic marmosets had low serum
vitamin E levels. The anemia responded to vitamin E and selenium therapy in two
marmosets. One of the five marmosets died before presentation, and two others
died despite therapy. The two marmosets necropsied had degenerative myopathy,
pyogranulomatous pansteatitis, and increased erythrophagocytosis and
hemosiderosis. The striated muscle and adipose tissue of both marmosets were
negative for coxsackievirus ribonucleic acid by in situ hybridization. These
findings suggest that vitamin E deficiency may be involved in the development of 
anemia, myopathy, and steatitis in callitrichids; however, in some marmosets,
underlying diseases such as chronic colitis may have influenced the development
of anemia and impaired vitamin E status.

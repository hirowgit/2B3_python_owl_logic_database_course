With increasing attention on the developmental causes of neuropsychiatric
disorders, appropriate animal models are crucial to identifying causes and
assessing potential interventions. The common marmoset is an ideal model as it
has sophisticated social/emotional behavior, reaching adulthood within 2 years of
birth. Magnetic resonance imaging was used in an accelerated longitudinal cohort 
(n = 41; aged 3-27 months; scanned 2-7 times over 2 years). Splines were used to 
model nonlinear trajectories of grey matter volume development in 53 cortical
areas and 16 subcortical nuclei. Generally, volumes increased before puberty,
peaked, and declined into adulthood. We identified 3 milestones of grey matter
development: I) age at peak volume; II) age at onset of volume decline; and III) 
age at maximum rate of volume decline. These milestones differentiated growth
trajectories of primary sensory/motor cortical areas from those of association
cortex but also revealed distinct trajectories between association cortices.
Cluster analysis of trajectories showed that prefrontal cortex was the most
heterogenous of association regions, comprising areas with distinct milestones
and developmental trajectories. These results highlight the potential of
high-field structural MRI to define the dynamics of primate brain development and
importantly to identify when specific prefrontal circuits may be most vulnerable 
to environmental impact.

A new-born (8-day-old) male marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) was found dead in a
zoo. The littermate and parents had no clinical abnormalities. By gross
observations at necropsy, there were moderate to severe multiple necrotic foci in
the liver and heart. Histopathological examinations also revealed mild focal
necrosis with neutrophilic infiltration in the cerebral cortex. By Giemsa stained
sections, intracytoplasmic bundles of large bacilli were observed in the
hepatocytes, intestinal epithelial cells, cardiac myocytes and neuronal cells
around the necrotic lesions. Immunohistochemically, these bacilli were intensely 
positive for rabbit sera against Clostridium piliforme, RT and MSK strains.
Although Tyzzer's disease has been rarely reported in primates, the central
nervous system (CNS) lesions by Clostridium piliforme infections are very
unusual.

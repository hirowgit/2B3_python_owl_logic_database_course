BACKGROUND: Histone to protamine exchange, in man, is only 80% complete and
spermatozoal histones are highly acetylated suggesting that their associated
genes may be involved in early gene expression in the embryo.
METHODS: Using in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry, we analyzed
expression of protamine-1 and protamine-2, and histone H4 specifically acetylated
at lysine 5 (H4K5ac), 8 (H4K8ac), 12 (H4K12ac) and 16 (H4K16ac) in human (n = 22)
and marmoset (n = 6) testes and ejaculates.
RESULTS: Protamine-1 and protamine-2 mRNA was present in round and elongating
spermatids. All antibodies against acetylated histones revealed positive signals 
in these cells. Human spermatogonia showed positive signals for H4K8ac and
H4K16ac, whereas marmoset spermatogonia were positive for H4K8ac and H4K12ac. In 
man, H4K16ac already displayed a positive immunoreaction with pachytene
spermatocytes, starting at stage III of the seminiferous epithelial cycle. All
antibodies showed positive immunostaining in ejaculated spermatozoa of both
species.
CONCLUSIONS: The common marmoset represents a suitable animal model for studies
on nuclear protein expression during human spermatogenesis. The two species
exhibit a similar organization of seminiferous epithelium and an identical
expression pattern of protamine-1 and protamine-2 mRNA in round and elongating
spermatids. The presence of specifically acetylated histones H4 in testicular
spermatids and ejaculated spermatozoa demonstrates an incomplete histone to
protamine exchange in both species. As acetylated histones are known to be
associated with genes involved in gene expression, the common marmoset may, in
future, be used as a model for investigations on early embryo development which, 
in man, are not possible for ethical reasons.

The present study demonstrates that horse and marmoset monkey sperm can bind to
the human zona of salt-stored oocytes that failed to fertilize in vitro. Marmoset
monkey sperm are also able to penetrate the salt-stored human zona. In contrast, 
human sperm do not bind to the zona of either horse or marmoset monkey oocytes.
These results suggest that human sperm binding to the zona pellucida is more
strictly species-specific than it is for horse and marmoset monkey sperm. In
contrast, horse and marmoset monkey sperm contain receptors recognized by the
human zona.

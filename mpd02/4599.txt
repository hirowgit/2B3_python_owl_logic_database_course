The acute toxicity of sarin in marmosets (Callithrix jacchus): a behavioral
analysis.

D'Mello GD, Duffy EA.

In marmosets, the clinical signs of poisoning following the administration of
sarin and the effects of sarin upon performance in three behavioral test models
were investigated. The sensitivity of marmosets to the lethal action of sarin was
shown to be greater than that of rodent species and rabbits but very similar to
that of the rhesus monkey. Doses of sarin ranging from 33 to 55% LD50, resulting 
in erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase inhibitions of 88% or more, were shown to
disrupt the performance of a food-reinforced visually guided reaching response.
However, the pattern of disruption did not suggest a specific action of sarin
upon visuomotor coordination and could not be explained on the basis of an
indirect effect of this agent upon either feeding motivation or changes in gross 
mobility. It was suggested that possible changes in animals' perception of the
reaching task and/or their own drugged ability may be relevant to any
interpretation of sarin-induced changes in visuomotor coordination in this
species.

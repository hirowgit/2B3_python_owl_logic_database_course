Neuropathological lesions found in chronic human Minamata disease tend to be
localized in the calcarine cortex of occipital lobes, the pre- and postcentral
lobuli, and the temporal gyri. The mechanism for the selective vulnerability is
still not clear, though several hypotheses have been proposed. One hypothesis is 
vascular and postulates that the lesions are the result of ischemia secondary to 
compression of sulcal arteries from methylmercury-induced cerebral edema. To test
this hypothesis, we studied common marmosets because the cerebrum of marmosets
has 2 distinct deep sulci, the calcarine and Sylvian fissures. MRI analysis,
mercury assays of tissue specimens, histologic and histochemical studies of the
brain are reported and discussed. Brains sacrificed early after exposure to
methylmercury showed high contents of methylmercury and edema of the cerebral
white matter. These results may explain the selective cortical degeneration along
the deep cerebral fissures or sulci.

Common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) are small non-human primates that
genetically lack cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9). Polymorphic marmoset CYP2C19
compensates by mediating oxidations of typical human CYP2C9/19
substrates.Twenty-four probe substrates were intravenously administered in
combinations to marmosets assigned to extensive or poor metaboliser (PM) groups
by CYP2C19 genotyping. Eliminations from plasma of cilomilast, phenytoin,
repaglinide, tolbutamide, and S-warfarin in the CYP2C19â€‰PM group were
significantly slow; these drugs are known substrates of human CYP2C8/9/19.Human
total clearance values and volumes of distribution of the 24 test compounds were 
extrapolated using single-species allometric scaling with experimental data from 
marmosets and found to be mostly comparable with the reported values.Human total 
clearance values and volumes of distribution of 15 of the 24 test compounds
similarly extrapolated using reported data sets from cynomolgus or rhesus monkeys
were comparable to the present predicted results, especially to those based on
data from PM marmosets.These results suggest that single-species allometric
scaling using marmosets, being small, has advantages over multiple-species-based 
allometry and could be applicable for pharmacokinetic predictions at the
discovery stage of drug development.

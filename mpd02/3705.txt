Our research group is studying, in the primate (marmoset), the conditions of an
anatomical and functional reconstruction of the spinal cord and of its motor
connections, following a focal spinal lesion. In this attempt to repair the
damaged neuronal circuitry, we used long segments of autologous peripheral nerves
joining the injured cervical spinal cord to an aneural region of the denervated
biceps brachialis muscle (7 marmosets) or to the musculocutaneous nerve (6
marmosets). After retrograde tracing (HRP) and histochemical studies of the
muscle, we found that a great number of neurons, located mostly in the ventral
part of the grey matter extended axons into the peripheral nerve graft. Some of
these labelled neurons were motoneurons, which could established functionnal
neuromuscular junctions. The muscle regeneration was effective but slower than
already known in rat studies.

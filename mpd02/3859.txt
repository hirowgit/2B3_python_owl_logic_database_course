DARPP-32 (a dopamine and adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cAMP) regulated
phosphoprotein of M(r) 32 kDa) and I-1 (phosphatase inhibitor-1) are related
phosphoproteins that have distinct regional distributions in some specific
neuronal structures. To determine whether they are also expressed in different
types of neurons we investigated their distribution in the cerebellum, whose
cellular structure is well characterized. In the cerebellar cortex, antibodies to
DARPP-32 labeled Purkinje cells and antibodies to I-1 labeled granule cells. The 
two phosphoproteins were also in synaptic apposition in the deep cerebellar
nuclei as well as in nuclei that project to the cerebellum via the climbing fiber
and mossy fiber systems. This pattern was consistent in different mammalian
species, including the mouse, marmoset, rhesus monkey and the mutant mouse
reeler. We suggest that DARPP-32 and I-1 have distinct roles in regulating
neuronal excitability in the cerebellum and may play different parts in the
phenomenon of long-term depression (LTD).

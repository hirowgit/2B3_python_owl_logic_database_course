Although deep brain electrical stimulation can alleviate the motor symptoms of
Parkinson disease (PD), just a small fraction of patients with PD can take
advantage of this procedure due to its invasive nature. A significantly less
invasive method--epidural spinal cord stimulation (SCS)--has been suggested as an
alternative approach for symptomatic treatment of PD. However, the mechanisms
underlying motor improvements through SCS are unknown. Here, we show that SCS
reproducibly alleviates motor deficits in a primate model of PD. Simultaneous
neuronal recordings from multiple structures of the cortico-basal
ganglia-thalamic loop in parkinsonian monkeys revealed abnormal highly
synchronized neuronal activity within each of these structures and excessive
functional coupling among them. SCS disrupted this pathological circuit behavior 
in a manner that mimics the effects caused by pharmacological dopamine
replacement therapy or deep brain stimulation. These results suggest that SCS
should be considered as an additional treatment option for patients with PD.

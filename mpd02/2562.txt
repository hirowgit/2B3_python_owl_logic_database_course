Empirical data have recently begun to inform debates on the evolutionary origins 
of music. In this paper we discuss some of our recent findings and related
theoretical issues. We claim that theories of the origins of music will be
usefully constrained if we can determine which aspects of music perception are
innate, and, of those, which are uniquely human and specific to music.
Comparative research in nonhuman animals, particularly nonhuman primates, is thus
critical to the debate. In this paper we focus on the preferences that
characterize most humans' experience of music, testing whether similar
preferences exist in nonhuman primates. Our research suggests that many
rudimentary acoustic preferences, such as those for consonant over dissonant
intervals, may be unique to humans. If these preferences prove to be innate in
humans, they may be candidates for music-specific adaptations. To establish
whether such preferences are innate in humans, one important avenue for future
research will be the collection of data from different cultures. This may be
facilitated by studies conducted over the internet.

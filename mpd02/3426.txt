Multiple sclerosis is an inflammatory demyelinating CNS disease of putatively
autoimmune origin. Novel models of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis
(EAE) have demonstrated that T cells specific for various myelin and even
nonmyelin proteins are potentially encephalitogenic. The encephalitogenic T cell 
response directed against different CNS antigens not only determines the lesional
topography of CNS inflammation but also the composition of the inflammatory
infiltrates. The heterogeneity of the lesional distribution seen in EAE might
therefore be useful for the understanding of the various clinical subtypes seen
in MS. In this review the possible candidate autoantigens in MS are discussed
with special regard to the human T cell and B cell responses against various
myelin and nonmyelin proteins.

Background: Recently, the use of common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) has
increased in biomedical research as an animal model. This study aimed to test
fecal samples to monitor bacterial and parasite infections in common marmoset at 
the Laboratory Animal Center of Osong Medical Innovation Foundation in Korea.
Methods: To monitor bacteria and parasites in common marmoset, we tested 43 fecal
samples of 43 common marmosets by culture and parasitological test in 2014.
Infection by Chilomastix mesnili was determined by PCR method.
Results: We identified nonpathogenic bacteria such as Proteus mirabilis and
Escherichia coli in feces of normal common marmosets. Interestingly, C. mesnili
was isolated from a healthy common marmoset by fecal centrifugation concentration
and PCR. The monkey infected with C. mesnili was treated with metronidazole.
After the treatment, C. mesnili were not found in feces using fecal
centrifugation concentration and PCR.
Conclusion: This is the first case report of C. mesnili infection in common
marmoset. Treatment with metronidazole is found to be highly effective in
eradicating C. mesnili infection in common marmoset.

Conditions of captivity of primates used in biomedical research may have
deleterious effects on the welfare of the animals and consequently on the
reliability of the research. We investigated the effects of cage size and cage
complexity, two fundamental characteristics of captive conditions, on the
behaviour of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus jacchus). We found an
increase in the general level of activity and significant variation in the
frequencies of specific behaviours with an increase in cage size and also with
cage complexity. Stereotyped behaviours, which occurred in the small cages, were 
never exhibited in the large cages. The effect of the novelty of the changed
conditions was also assessed and found to be significant for some behaviours. We 
also measured the time taken to capture an animal, a task frequently performed by
the animal technician, under the various cage conditions. Capture time increased 
significantly in the larger cages, but the overall effect of the changes to the
marmosets' housing conditions on the animal technician's work was not regarded as
substantial. We conclude that the welfare of captive marmosets is enhanced by the
provision of larger and more complex cages, and that such cages do not
significantly affect the efficiency of the research laboratory.

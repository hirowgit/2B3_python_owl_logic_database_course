Immunocytochemical localization of FSH was carried out in various cell types of
marmoset testes during development using antisera generated against intact as
well as beta-subunit of human FSH. Significant differences in the intensity as
well as distribution of FSH in various cell types were observed in neonatal,
pubertal, and adult marmosets. Intensity of staining in Leydig cells was maximum 
at day 1 and in adults (1-3 years), whereas it was minimum at 3 months. In
seminiferous tubules (Sertoli cells), FSH was present in trace amount until
puberty and subsequently increased at maturity. Further studies demonstrate de
novo biosynthesis of FSH-like moiety in vitro by testicular tissue, which was age
dependent.

The subependymal layer (SEL) of the postnatal marmoset, a simian primate, has
been investigated by histological and electron microscopic techniques. Although
well documented in rodents, little is known about this layer in primates. The
distribution of the SEL in marmosets is most extensive at birth around the
anterior lateral ventricles, where the layer is generally 5-10 cells deep;
however, there is considerable regional variation. With age the size of the SEL
decreases dramatically, becoming very poorly demarcated in adult animals.
Ultrastructurally, many subependymal cells in neonatal and young brains display
the features of undifferentiated cells, although neurons and glia are also
present. Cells displaying features intermediate between astrocytes and
undifferentiated SEL cells are occasionally encountered. In adults
undifferentiated cells are seen rarely and the former SEL is composed primarily
of glial and neuronal processes. Thus the layer in primates probably represents a
site of continued cellular differentiation in the postnatal brain and as such
must play an important role in the final stages of cortical development.

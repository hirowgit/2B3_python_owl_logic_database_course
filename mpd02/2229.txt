Common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) males are bi-parental non-human primates
that show extensive paternal behaviour. Fathers are in direct sensory contact
with their infants during the natal period. We found that fathers exposed to
isolated scents of their infant displayed a significant drop in serum
testosterone levels within 20min after exposure, whereas parentally naive males
did not. These data suggest that infant's scent may have a causal role in
regulating paternal testosterone in their fathers. This is the first study to
demonstrate that olfactory cues have an acute effect on paternal care.

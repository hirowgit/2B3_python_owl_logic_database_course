PURPOSE: To describe the pre-surgical, surgical, and post-surgical considerations
for phacoemulsification in non-human primates.
METHODS: Records of non-human primates that underwent phacoemulsification by the 
Ophthalmology Services of FHCV-UAB and HCV-UM, between 2003 and 2009 were
reviewed.
RESULTS: Five primates were represented: one gorilla, one chimpanzee, one pygmy
marmoset, one orangutan, and one chacma baboon. Three were males and two females,
of a median age of 16.8 years. Four primates presented bilateral cataracts and
one unilateral (n = 9 eyes). Cataracts were immature in two eyes, mature in four 
and hypermature in 3. One-handed phacoemulsification was used in seven eyes and a
two-handed technique in 2. Intraocular lenses (IOLs), with optic powers between
+19.0 and +21.5D, were implanted in the four large-sized primates. All the
primates were more active and social after the surgery.
CONCLUSION: Phacoemulsification in non-human primates is highly successful and
associated with an overall good visual outcome. Nevertheless, specific
considerations should be applied in these species.

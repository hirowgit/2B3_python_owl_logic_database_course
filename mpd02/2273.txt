80 kDaHSA has been demonstrated to be responsible for inducing immunoinfertility.
Synthetic peptides NT, 1, 2 and 4 of 80 kDaHSA are immunogenic and
immunobiologically mimic the native protein. Peptides 1 and NT being highly
immunogenic their potential for contraceptive vaccine development was evaluated. 
Active immunization of male rabbits with peptide-1 and -NT induced reversible
infertility in 100% and 60% of animals, respectively and subsequently active
immunization of non-human primate model, male marmosets with peptide-1 induced
reversible infertility in six out of seven high antibody titer animals. The
present study suggests the potential of peptide-1 of 80 kDaHSA for the
development of contraceptive vaccine.

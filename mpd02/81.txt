Animal welfare is critical to buffer stress in captive animals and to ensure the 
reliability of data from studies. The most usual environmental enrichment
technique (EE) for social non-human primates is the social enrichment. However,
some experimental protocols require keeping individuals isolated, thus demanding 
other types of EE. We tested in six adult Callithrix jacchus females, single
housed for experimental purpose, the stress buffering efficacy of a structural
enrichment protocol (SEP) and SEP in combination with a foraging enrichment
(FSEP) using  fecal cortisol and behaviors to infer stress levels. Both types of 
EE improved welfare in different ways, while cortisol levels decreased with both 
EE as compared to the baseline, autogrooming, and piloerection increased after
FSEP probably due to the new foods. Therefore, these findings support alternative
practices of EE when social animals are living in isolation and reinforce the
positive role of structural and food enrichment for decreasing stress markers. It
also encourages studies on welfare with females, since its use as an animal model
has increased.

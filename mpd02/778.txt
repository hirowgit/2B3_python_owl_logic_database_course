Pheromones are crucial for eliciting innate responses and inducing social and
sexual behaviors in mammals. The vomeronasal receptor 1 genes, V1Rs, encode
members of a pheromone receptor family that are mainly expressed in the
vomeronasal organ (VNO). The V1R family shows extraordinary variety in gene
number among vertebrates owing to successive gene gains and losses during
evolution. Such diversity is believed to reflect a degree of dependence on the
VNO. We investigated V1R evolution in primate lineages closely related to humans 
because these VNOs show a trend toward degeneration. We performed extensive
phylogenetic analyses for V1Rs from a broad range of primate species. Although
the decline of intact genes was evident in anthropoids (hominoids, Old World
monkeys and New World monkeys), we found that a certain number of intact genes
persist in New World monkeys. In one New World monkey species, the common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), we examined seven putatively functional V1Rs using
in situ hybridization and reverse transcription-PCR. Based on their mRNA
expression patterns in the VNO and other organs, two types of V1Rs emerged: the
canonical class with VNO-specific expression, and a second group having more
ubiquitous expression in various organs as well as VNO. Furthermore, phylogenetic
analysis revealed that the class with the more widespread expression had been
retained longer in evolution than the VNO-specific type. We propose that the
acquisition of a novel non-VNO-related function(s) may have led to the survival
of a small but persistent number of V1Rs in anthropoid primates.

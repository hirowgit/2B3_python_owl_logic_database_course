An immunohistochemical study of the middle ear muscles of some carnivores and
primates, with special reference to the IIM and slow-tonic fibre types.

The middle ear muscles of several species of carnivores (cat, dog, fox, ferret
and stone-marten) and some New World monkeys (Callithrix, Saimiri) and Old World 
monkeys (Cercopithecus, Macaca) were examined. The fibre type compositions of
these muscles were determined by a combination of the standard histochemical
myofibrillar ATPase method, and immunohistochemical techniques using
myosintype-specific antisera. Immunohistochemically slow-tonic fibres were found 
in the stapedius muscles of only two carnivores, the ferret and stone-marten. In 
all the carnivores and the New World monkeys, tensor tympani muscle contained
IIM, slow-tonic and slow-twitch fibres, but in the Old World monkeys it resembled
stapedius muscle, and contained only Type I (slow-twitch) and IIA fibres. Thus,
because all the species examined had IIM fibres in the jaw-closer muscles, this
means that the common embryological origin of tensor tympani muscle and the
jaw-closers does not necessarily result in tensor tympani muscle containing this 
fibre type even though IIM fibres occur only in first branchial arch muscles.
This fact, together with other species differences in the fibre type composition 
of these muscles, shows that there is no typical composition of middle ear
muscles in general, and suggests that the differences are related to very
different functional requirements.

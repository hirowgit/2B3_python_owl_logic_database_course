Like other simian primates, the New World monkey Callithrix jacchus, marmoset,
and Saguinus fuscicollis, tamarin, require ascorbic acid as an essential
nutrient. For adult marmosets, a daily intake of 15 mg/kg metabolic body weight
was found to be necessary to obtain a serum level above the kidney threshold. A
survey of the serum ascorbic acid level of marmosets and tamarins in a breeding
colony resulted in a vast divergence between the two species, indicating a higher
ascorbic acid requirement for tamarins. Unaccustomed trial conditions or
additional stressors resulted in a higher catabolism of ascorbic acid to CO2 in
both species, measured with 14C labeled material, compared to a higher rate of
renal excretion when the animals were accustomed to the metabolic cage. These
isotope excretion studies suggest a different metabolic behavior of ascorbic acid
in the two species. This is supposedly caused by a higher sensitivity of the
tamarins when subjected to the same conditions as marmosets.

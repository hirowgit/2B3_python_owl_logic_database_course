There has been a surge of interest in the structure and function of the mammalian
claustrum in recent years. However, most anatomical and physiological studies
treat the claustrum as a relatively homogenous structure. Relatively little
attention has been directed toward possible compartmentalization of the claustrum
complex into anatomical subdivisions, and how this compartmentalization is
reflected in claustrum connections with other brain structures. In this study, we
examined the cyto- and myelo-architecture of the claustrum of the common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus), to determine whether the claustrum contains internal
anatomical structures or compartments, which could facilitate studies focused on 
understanding its role in brain function. NeuN, Nissl, calbindin, parvalbumin,
and myelin-stained sections from eight adult marmosets were studied using light
microscopy and serial reconstruction to identify potential internal compartments.
Ultra high resolution (9.4T) post-mortem magnetic resonance imaging was employed 
to identify tractographic differences between identified claustrum
subcompartments by diffusion-weighted tractography. Our results indicate that the
classically defined marmoset claustrum includes at least two major subdivisions, 
which correspond to the dorsal endopiriform and insular claustrum nuclei, as
described in other species, and that the dorsal endopiriform nucleus (DEnD)
contains architecturally distinct compartments. Furthermore, the dorsal
subdivision of the DEnD is tractographically distinguishable from the insular
claustrum with respect to cortical connections.

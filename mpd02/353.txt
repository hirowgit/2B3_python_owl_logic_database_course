Aging Western societies are facing an increasing prevalence of chronic
autoimmune-mediated inflammatory disorders (AIMIDs) for which treatments that are
safe and effective are scarce. One of the main reasons for this situation is the 
lack of animal models, which accurately replicate clinical and pathological
aspects of the human diseases. One important AIMID is the neuroinflammatory
disease multiple sclerosis (MS), for which the mouse experimental autoimmune
encephalomyelitis (EAE) model has been frequently used in preclinical research.
Despite some successes, there is a long list of experimental treatments that have
failed to reproduce promising effects observed in murine EAE models when they
were tested in the clinic. This frustrating situation indicates a wide validity
gap between mouse EAE and MS. This monography describes the development of an EAE
model in nonhuman primates, which may help to bridge the gap.

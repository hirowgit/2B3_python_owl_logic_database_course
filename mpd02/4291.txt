FCE 23884, a newly synthetized ergoline derivative, shows dopamine (DA) agonist
or antagonist properties depending on the functional state of the biological
substrate. The compound behaves as a full DA antagonist in normal animals, but
shows full agonist properties in denervated models in the same dose range. In
normal animals, FCE 23884 impairs Sidmans avoidance in rats, reduces spontaneous 
locomotion in mice and monkeys and antagonizes apomorphine-induced climbing
behavior in mice, yawning in rats, emesis in dogs and amphetamine-induced
toxicity in grouped mice. After experimental procedures resulting in severe DA
depletion, FCE 23884 behaves as a powerful DA-agonist mainly at D-1 receptors.
FCE 23884 induces contralateral turning behavior in 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned
rats and reverses 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-induced akinesia
in monkeys and reserpine-induced hypokinesia in mice. These results indicate that
the antagonist or agonist activity of FCE 23884 is substrate-dependent and mostly
related to the presence or absence of DA. This leads to the apparently
paradoxical suggestion that the compound could be useful both in psychotic states
and extrapyramidal diseases, i.e., in clinical conditions characterized by either
excessive or impaired DAergic neurotransmission.

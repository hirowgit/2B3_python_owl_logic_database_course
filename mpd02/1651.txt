Study of avian and piscine species has shown that animals with stronger
lateralization of the brain are able to perform two tasks presented
simultaneously better than can animals with weaker lateralization. We
investigated whether this might apply also to primates by testing common
marmosets to see whether there is a relationship between the strength of hand
preference, as an indicator of strength of brain lateralization, and the ability 
to carry out two tasks simultaneously. A model predator was introduced into the
testing room while the marmoset was foraging. Marmosets with stronger hand
preferences detected the 'predator' after shorter latency than those with weaker 
hand preferences. Furthermore, the marmosets with stronger hand preferences
produced more mobbing (tsik) vocalizations when they reacted to the predators
than did those with weaker hand preferences. There was no such association
between hand preference and either latency to respond to the predator or mobbing 
reaction when the marmosets were not foraging at the time the predator was
introduced. Hence, strength of lateralization is associated with the ability to
perform foraging and predator detection simultaneously. These results are
discussed with reference to the evolution of brain lateralization.

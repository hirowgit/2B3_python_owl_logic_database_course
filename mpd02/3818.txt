A cytosolic 23kDa protein was initially purified from bovine brain and shown to
bind phosphatidylethanolamine. Later, it was also characterized in rat and human 
brain, and it is now known to be widespread, having been found in numerous
tissues in several species. Here, we report the high level of mRNA and
phosphatidyl ethanolamine binding protein expression in rat testis and to a
lesser extent in mouse testis. In human testis, although it was not detectable by
Northern blot analysis, the mRNA was shown to be present when PCR amplification
was performed. Immunohistochemical experiments revealed that the testicular
phosphatidylethanolamine binding protein (tPBP) is principally expressed in the
elongated spermatids of both rat and mouse testis. This finding, and the
association of tPBP with cellular membranes, suggest its possible implication in 
membrane remodelling during spermatid maturation.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a small New World non-human primate
indigenous to northeastern Brazil. This species has been attracting the attention
of biomedical researchers and neuroscientists for its ease of handling and colony
maintenance, unique behavioral characteristics, and several human-like traits,
such as enriched social vocal communication and strong relationships between
parents and offspring. Its high reproductive efficiency makes it particularly
amenable for use in the development of transgenic and genome editing technologies
in a non-human primate model. Our group has recently generated transgenic
marmosets with germ line transmission, opening new avenues in primate research.
In this chapter, we describe recent advances in neuroscience and disease research
using common marmosets, and we outline potential uses of genome editing in
non-human primates toward the development of knock-in/knock-out marmosets.

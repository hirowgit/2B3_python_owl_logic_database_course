Sphingolipids and enzymes of the sphingolipid rheostat determine synaptic
appearance and signaling in the brain, but sphingolipid contribution to normal
behavioral plasticity is little understood. Here we asked how the sphingolipid
rheostat contributes to learning and memory of various dimensions. We
investigated the role of these lipids in the mechanisms of two different types of
memory, such as appetitively and aversively motivated memory, which are
considered to be mediated by different neural mechanisms. We found an association
between superior performance in short- and long-term appetitively motivated
learning and regionally enhanced neutral sphingomyelinase (NSM) activity. An
opposite interaction was observed in an aversively motivated task. A
valence-dissociating role of NSM in learning was confirmed in mice with
genetically reduced NSM activity. This role may be mediated by the NSM control of
N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor subunit expression. In a translational approach, we
confirmed a positive association of serum NSM activity with long-term
appetitively motivated memory in nonhuman primates and in healthy humans.
Altogether, these data suggest a new sphingolipid mechanism of de-novo learning
and memory, which is based on NSM activity.

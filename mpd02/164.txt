POU class 5 homeobox 1 (POU5F1, also known as OCT4) is critical for maintenance
of pluripotency, germ cell fate, reprogramming into a pluripotent state, and
early embryogenesis. We generated an embryonic stem cell (ESC) line of the common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) harboring a heterozygous knock-in allele of
OCT4-P2A-mCerulean-T2A-pac. The ESC line (CMES40-OC) will be valuable for
investigation of primed/naïve pluripotency and germ cell fate. Homozygous OCT4
knock-in clones were generated but could not be sustained in an undifferentiated 
state in long-term culture. The OCT4 knock-in system facilitated simultaneous
knock-in of a reporter construct at another locus, DDX4 (VASA).

We describe a cost- and time-efficient method for designing new microsatellite
markers in any species with substantial genomic DNA sequence data available.
Using this technique, we report 14 new polymorphic dinucleotide microsatellite
loci isolated from the common marmoset. The relative yield of new polymorphisms
was higher with less labor than described in previous marmoset studies. Of 20
loci initially evaluated, 14 were polymorphic and amplified reliably (70% success
rate). The number of alleles ranged from 3 to 9 with heterozygosity varying from 
0.48 to 0.83.

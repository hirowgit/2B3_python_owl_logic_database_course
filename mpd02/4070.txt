The behaviour and cognitive abilities of marmosets with bilateral ablations of
either the archicortex on the mediodorsal surface or the paleocortex on the
ventrolateral surface of the frontal lobes were assessed in terms of the types of
information being handled, the mode of action (inhibitory versus productive
mechanisms), and the level of functioning of these frontal areas. Although there 
was a tendency for the ventrolateral ablation to produce a greater impairment on 
object than on spatial discrimination in comparison to the mediodorsal ablation, 
the differences between the two groups was not marked in this respect. The effect
of ablations of either of these areas was more marked on tasks which required the
inhibition of prepotent responses than on tasks where novel or arbitrary
responses were appropriate. The major effect of both lesions was the production
of perseverative behaviour which occurred at the level of motor output in the
first few days after surgery but was then observed at the level of choice
behaviour and attentional set in formal cognitive tests. Impairments were also
seen on postoperative retention of tasks learnt prior to surgery. It is suggested
that all these impairments arise from an inability to use or modify stored
information.

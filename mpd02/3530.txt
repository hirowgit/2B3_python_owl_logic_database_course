Five hundred forty-three blood samples from 15 populations of the four genera of 
callitrichin primates were studied electrophoretically. Polymorphism and genetic 
distances were estimated for 20 loci, 13 of which were polymorphic. The lion
tamarin (Leontopithecus) studied here exhibited the least variability for these
loci, while the monospecific Cebuella showed the most. The genetic distances
observed between Callithrix and Cebuella genera support previous evidence
indicating a close taxonomic relationship between them. Genetic distance values
obtained in this study also support the synonimyzation of the kuhli form with
Callithrix jacchus penicillata.

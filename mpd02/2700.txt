Monkeys with crossed unilateral lesions of the dorsomedial thalamus and
contralateral ablations of the inferotemporal cortex were mildly impaired on
acquisition and retention of visual conditional tasks requiring the integration
of information about objects and their positions in space. They were not impaired
on other conditional and nonconditional tasks. This impairment pattern resembles,
qualitatively, that found following crossed unilateral lesions of the anterior
thalamus and the inferotemporal cortex or bilateral lesions of the anterior and
mediodorsal thalamic nuclei. Although the flow of visual information from the
inferotemporal cortex through the hippocampal-fornix-anterior thalamic circuit
plays a major part in memory for objects in places, the flow of information
between inferotemporal cortex and mediodorsal thalamus, possibly by means of the 
frontal cortex, also makes some contribution.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a New World primate that is used in
biomedical research due to its small size and relative ease of handling compared 
with larger primates. Although bone disease in common marmosets is well
recognized, there are very few detailed descriptions in the literature that cover
the range of lesions seen in these animals. For all animals used to model human
disease, it is important to be aware of background lesions that may affect the
interpretation of study findings. This retrospective study details bone diseases 
encountered in marmoset breeding colonies at 2 different institutions. Affected
marmosets at Johns Hopkins University had lesions compatible with diagnoses of
rickets, fibrous osteodystrophy and osteopenia. Affected marmosets at the
Wisconsin National Primate Research Center exhibited severe lesions of
osteoclastic bone resorption and remodeling that had an unusual distribution and 
were not easily categorized into a known disease entity. The purpose of this
report is to document these naturally occurring skeletal lesions of common
marmosets and suggest an approach to evaluating skeletal disease in prospective
studies of these animals that will allow the most accurate diagnoses.

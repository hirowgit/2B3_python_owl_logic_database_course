Epigenetic processes have been implicated in neuronal plasticity following
repeated cocaine application. Here we measured DNA methylation at promoter CpG
sites of the dopamine transporter (DAT1) and serotonin transporter (SERT) and
neurokinin3-receptor (NK3-R)-receptor (TACR3) coding genes in marmoset monkeys
after repeated cocaine injections in a conditioned place preference paradigm. We 
found a decrease in DNA methylation at a specific CpG site in TACR3, but not DAT1
or SERT. Thus, TACR3 is a locus for DNA methylation changes in response to
repeated cocaine administration and its establishment as a reinforcer, in support
of other evidence implicating the NK3-R in reinforcement- and addiction-related
processes.

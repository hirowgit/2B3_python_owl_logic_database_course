INTRODUCTION: The morphological study of wild animals serves as a base for more
advanced studies in clinical medicine, surgery, and pathology. Due to an urgent
need and demand for professionals specialized in this area, studies of this
nature have become indispensable and so the objective of the present study was to
describe the heart morphology of Callithrix jacchus.
METHODS: Ten anatomic pieces of common marmoset were used. The hearts were
removed and dissected for better visualization and thus to makes a detailed
description of the structures of the organ of the C jacchus species.
RESULTS: The C jacchus heart is similar to that of other mammals, with small
anatomical modifications such as division of the apex by the interventricular
grooves, shallow fossa ovalis, and less salient intervenous tubercle.
CONCLUSIONS: This study may serve as taxonomic base for research and also as a
basis for clinical and surgical procedures with the C jacchus.

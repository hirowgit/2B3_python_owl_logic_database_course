Vasopressin (AVP) and oxytocin (OT) immunoreactive (ir) neurons and fibers were
examined in the forebrain of male and female common marmosets (Callithrix
jacchus). As expected from previous studies of cell distribution in the rodent
and primate brain, AVP-ir cells were most evident in the paraventricularis,
supraopticus, and suprachiasmaticus of the hypothalamus. AVP-ir cells were also
widely distributed in the lateral hypothalamus and the bed nucleus of the stria
terminalis. A sexually dimorphic pattern of AVP-ir cells was found in the bed
nucleus of the stria terminalis, in which males had more AVP-ir cells than
females. OT-ir cells were found in the paraventricularis and supraopticus of the 
hypothalamus as well as in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and the medial
amygdala. Male and female marmosets did not differ in the distribution of OT-ir
cells. Fibers for both AVP and OT were evident outside of the
hypothalamic-neurohypophyseal tract, but a plexus of AVP-ir fibers in the lateral
septum or lateral habenular nucleus, as seen in the rat brain, could not be
detected for either peptide.

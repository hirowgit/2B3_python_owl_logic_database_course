The home range of one group of the Geoffroy's marmoset (Callithrix geoffroyi) was
studied in a fragment of the Atlantic Forest in south-eastern Brazil, between
February 1993 and January 1994. The total home range was 23.3 ha and the area
used in the dry season was significantly larger than that of the wet season. The 
smallest distance travelled by group was 480 m/day in May and the longest was
1,980 m/day in March, but with no significant differences between seasons. The
total home range used for this species agrees with the ecological grouping of the
genus Callithrix proposed by Rylands & Faria (1993) and may be associated with
the habitat structure, the limit of the fragment and the inexistence of
neighbouring groups.

Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonists have been shown to be
efficacious as abortive migraine therapeutics with the absence of cardiovascular 
liabilities that are associated with triptans. Herein, we report the discovery of
a highly potent CGRP receptor antagonist, BMS-742413, with the potential to
provide rapid onset of action through intranasal delivery. The compound displays 
excellent aqueous solubility, oxidative stability, and toxicological profile.
BMS-742413 has good intranasal bioavailability in the rabbit and shows a robust, 
dose-dependent inhibition of CGRP-induced increases in marmoset facial blood
flow.

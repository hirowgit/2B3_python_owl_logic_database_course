Undifferentiated carcinoma of the nasal tissues in the common marmoset.

Baskerville M, Baskerville A, Manktelow BW.

The occurrence of undifferentiated carcinoma of the nasal tissues in 3 adult
marmosets is described. The tumours appeared to arise from the respiratory
epithelium of the turbinate bones and nasal septum. They were poorly
differentiated, invaded the paranasal sinuses and hard palate and metastasized to
the lungs or liver.

Mn- and Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD) cDNAs of eight primate species, Pan
troglodytes, Pongo pygmaeus, Hylobates lar, Macaca fuscata, Macaca fascicularis, 
Macaca mulatta, Cebus apella, and Callithrix jacchus, were cloned. The whole
protein-coding sequences were covered, comparing 198 and 153 (or 154) amino
acids, for Mn- and Cu,Zn-SODs, respectively. Residues forming metal ligands were 
completely conserved in the two primate SODs and nucleotide/amino acid
substitutions were more frequent in Cu,Zn-SODs than in Mn-SODs. Molecular
evolutionary analyses showed Mn-SOD to have evolved at a constant rate and its
phylogenetic tree well reflected primate phylogeny. Cu,Zn-SOD was shown to have
evolved differently between primate lineages. The significant high ratio of a
non-synonymous/synonymous rate was found in the lineage leading to great apes and
humans, showing that this lineage underwent positive Darwinian selection.
Southern hybridization suggested that the genes for primate Mn- and Cu,Zn-SOD
exist as single copies. Northern analysis in various Japanese monkey tissues
showed Mn- and Cu,Zn-SOD expression to be high in the liver, kidneys, and adrenal
glands.

BACKGROUND: Marmosets are a powerful, emerging model for human behavior and
neurological disorders. However, longitudinal imaging modalities that visualize
both cellular structure and function within the cortex are not available in this 
animal model. Hence, we implemented an approach to quantify vascular topology,
hemodynamics, and neural activity in awake marmosets using two-photon microscopy 
(2PM).
NEW METHOD: Marmosets were acclimated to a custom stereotaxic system.
AAV1-GCaMP5G was injected into somatosensory cortex to optically indicate neural 
activity, and a cranial chamber was implanted.
RESULTS: Longitudinal 2PM revealed vasculature and neurons 500Î¼m below the
cortical surface. Vascular response and neural activity during sensory
stimulation were preserved over 5 and 3 months, respectively, before optical
quality deteriorated. Vascular remodeling including increased tortuosity and
branching was quantified. However, capillary connectivity from arterioles to
venules remained unchanged. Further, behavioral assessment before and after
surgery demonstrated no impact on cognitive and motor function.
Immunohistochemistry confirmed minimal astrocyte activation with no focal damage.
Over 6 months, total cortical depth visualized decreased. When under anesthesia, 
the most prominent isoflurane-induced vasodilation occurred in capillaries and
smaller arterioles.
COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHOD(S): These results demonstrate the capability to
repeatedly observe cortical physiology in awake marmosets over months.
CONCLUSIONS: This work provides a novel and insightful technique to investigate
critical mechanisms in neurological disorders in awake marmosets without
introducing confounds from anesthesia.

Programmed electrical stimulation was used to examine the ability of long-term
dietary lipid modulation to influence myocardial vulnerability to the induction
of ventricular fibrillation in adult marmoset monkeys (Callithrix jacchus).
Marmosets fed diets supplemented (to a total of 28.5% of the energy as fat) with 
polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)-rich tuna fish oil or sunflower seed oil had
significantly elevated mean ventricular fibrillation threshold compared with
those fed a saturated animal fat supplemented diet or a reference diet not
supplemented with fat (11.2% of the energy as fat). Fibrillation threshold was
reduced during acute myocardial ischemia induced by coronary artery occlusion but
still remained higher in the PUFA-fed animals than either the control or the
ischemic threshold in reference or saturated fat supplemented animals. Dietary
tuna fish oil was associated with a low incidence of sustained fibrillation
episodes and no fatalities. These results indicate that myocardial substrate
vulnerability to arrhythmic stimuli is increased during ischemia in a nonhuman
primate model but dietary PUFA can reduce vulnerability under both normal and
ischemic conditions. Reduced dietary fat intake alone was without effect.

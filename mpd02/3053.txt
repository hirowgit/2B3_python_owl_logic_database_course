Common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) form extended families, and several cohorts
of young may reside together. Play is shown extensively among the offspring. We
hypothesized that opiate activity modulates social play, and predicted that
administration of morphine (0.5 mg/kg) would facilitate social play, whereas
pretreatment with naloxone (0.5 mg/kg) would block morphine's effects. Morphine
administration was associated with significantly increased social play, and the
effect of morphine was attributable to the focal subject, since play initiated by
others was unaffected by treatment. Non-social categories of play, such as object
manipulation and locomotor play, and affiliative behaviors, such as time spent
huddled, were unaffected by treatment. Twittering and play face, behaviors used
by young during play, also increased after morphine administration. Pretreatment 
with naloxone blocked morphine's effects. Total activity was significantly
increased by morphine administration. We conclude that social play is
specifically facilitated by opiate activation, whereas other categories of play
behavior and social behavior were unaffected by morphine. Thus, social play
represents a distinct category of social behavior in juvenile common marmosets
with regulatory processes that are unique from other types of social behavior.

Botulism is a well-known intoxication that affects humans and animals. The
disease is endemic in cattle in Brazil and recently emerged as an important
disease in commercial laying hens and broiler chickens in Europe. Dogs and other 
animal species can also be affected. Although antitoxins are commonly
administered to humans diagnosed with botulism, in animals this is rarely the
case and the treatment of botulism is still based only on support therapy. In the
present work, we report an outbreak of type C botulism in Brazil that
simultaneously affected domestic chickens, dogs and a black-pencilled marmoset
(Callithrix penicillata). The successful use of Clostridium botulinum types C and
D antitoxin for the treatment of an affected dog is also described.

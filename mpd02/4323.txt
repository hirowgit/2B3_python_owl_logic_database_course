It is reported on four cases of pseudotuberculosis in 2 Saimiri sciureus, 1
Callithrix jacchus/penicillata hybrid and 1 S. oedipus. The animals came from two
different groups, one being infected with Y. pseudotuberculosis serotype I, the
other with Y. pseudotuberculosis serotype II. All cases showed intestinal
infection of thermophile Campylobacter. Remarkable were severe haemorrhagic
components and the distinct RHS-proliferation, especially in the mesenteric
lymphatic nodes.

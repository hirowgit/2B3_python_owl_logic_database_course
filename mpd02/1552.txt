Allometric studies in primates have shown that the cerebral cortex, cerebellum,
and remaining brain structures increase in size as a linear function of their
numbers of neurons and nonneuronal cells across primates. Whether such scaling
rules also apply to functionally related structures such as those of the auditory
system is unknown. Here, we investigate the scaling of brain structures in the
auditory pathway of six primate species and the closely related tree shrew. Using
the isotropic fractionator method to estimate the numbers of neurons and
nonneuronal cells in the inferior colliculus, medial geniculate nucleus, and
auditory cortex (Ac), we assessed how they scaled across species and examined the
relative scaling relationships among them. As expected, each auditory structure
scales in mass as a linear function of its number of neurons, with no significant
changes in neuronal density across species. The Ac scales proportionately with
the cerebral cortex as a whole, maintaining a relative mass of approximately 1%
and a relative number of neurons of 0.7%. However, the Ac gains neurons faster
than both subcortical structures examined. As a result, larger primate brains
have increased ratios of cortical to subcortical neurons involved in processing
auditory information.

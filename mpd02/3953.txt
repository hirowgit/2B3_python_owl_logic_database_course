The ultrastructural and histochemical alterations during different stages of
spontaneously occurring IgM nephropathy in Callitrichidae were determined.
Callitrichid IgM nephropathy was classified according to the light microscopic
sequence of the mesangial lesions in the individual glomeruli. In minimal disease
and axial proliferation mesangial cells and mesangial matrix were symmetrically
increased, whereas in panmesangial disease matrix deposition exceeded the
cellular responses. However, ultrastructural matrix changes such as deposition of
electron-dense particles, dilatation of the matrix channel system, and slightly
increased collagen fiber expression were present also in minimal disease and
axial proliferation. Histochemically collagen I and III phenotypes could only be 
verified in glomerular sclerosis, at that time accompanied by diminution of
collagen IV. The mesangial cellular lesions, in contrast, were very limited. The 
numerical increase in mesangial cells was associated with increased bleb
formation and increased heterolysosome contents, whereas the amount of
microfilaments was never increased.

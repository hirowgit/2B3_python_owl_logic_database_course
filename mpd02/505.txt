Reciprocity and cooperation are fundamental to human society and are observed in 
nonhuman primates. Primates are not only sensitive to direct reciprocity and its 
violation but also indirect reciprocity. Recent studies demonstrated that some
primate species adjusted their behavior by observing others' interactions.
Capuchin, marmoset, and squirrel monkeys avoided taking food from human actors
who behaved nonreciprocally; however, no such empirical evidence among Old World 
monkeys is available. Here, we show that common marmosets, which are a highly
prosocial species, discriminated between human actors who reciprocated in social 
exchanges and those who did not; however, Japanese monkeys, who are renowned for 
despotic social relationships, did not. In the reciprocal condition, 2 human
actors exchanged food equally, whereas in the nonreciprocal condition, 1 actor
(nonreciprocator) ended up with all the food and the other actor with none. The
common marmosets avoided receiving food from the nonreciprocator in the
nonreciprocal condition. Nevertheless, the Japanese monkeys did not show
differential preferences in either condition. These results suggest a crucial
role for prosocial tendencies in monkeys' responses to asymmetric exchanges and
indicate that third-party social evaluations are not homologous among primates.
Further comparative studies with direct comparisons will be required to explore
the underlying mechanism of third-party social evaluations. (PsycINFO Database

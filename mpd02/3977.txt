To assess the effects of inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system at different 
levels on plasma concentrations of components of the system and on renin and
angiotensinogen gene expression, marmosets on a low-sodium diet were treated for 
1 wk by continuous intraperitoneal infusion with either the renin inhibitor
CGP-29287, the ACE inhibitor benazeprilat, the angiotensin II antagonist
valsartan, the renin inhibitory monoclonal antibody R-3-36-16, or vehicle. Plasma
total immunoreactive renin increased (14- to 20-fold) after all three modes of
interference. Plasma angiotensinogen was significantly reduced in the
benazeprilat- and valsartan-treated marmosets but not in the CGP-29287-treated
animals. Plasma concentration of angiotensin II was significantly decreased in
the benazeprilat-, CGP-29287-, and R-3-36-16-treated marmosets and was increased 
in the valsartan-treated marmosets. Kidney renin mRNA level increased 8- to
15-fold in all groups. Hepatic angiotensinogen mRNA level increased with
CGP-29287 treatment but decreased with the other treatments. Kidney
angiotensinogen mRNA level was not affected by any treatment. Different modes of 
inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system have different effects on plasma
components of the system and liver angiotensinogen expression.

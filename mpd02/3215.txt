Infant marmosets were fitted with zero-powered (plano) soft contact lenses from 4
to 8 weeks of age worn either continuously (24 h per day) (n = 4), for 12 h (n = 
4), or for 8 h (n = 3) per day to determine whether limiting the daily duration
of lens-wear could significantly reduce or eliminate the effects of continuous
lens-wear on ocular growth and refractive state. As in macaques (Hung, L. F., &
Smith, E. L. (1996). Extended-wear, soft, contact lenses produce hyperopia in
young monkeys. Optometry and Vision Science, 73, 579-584), eyes fitted with
contact lenses worn continuously developed more hyperopic refractions (mean +3.22
+/- 1.49 D SE) compared to their fellow untreated eyes, inconsistent changes in
vitreous chamber depth (-0.02 +/- 0.09 mm SE) and flatter corneas (mean decrease 
in corneal power 4.22 +/- 0.39 D SE). Eyes wearing lenses for only 12 h per day
showed similar but reduced effects compared to the 24-h group. Most importantly, 
ocular growth, corneal power and refraction were unaffected in the 8-h group.
Future studies using contact lenses in infant primates should employ a reduced
daily duration of lens-wear to eliminate the undesirable effect of contact
lens-wear per se on ocular development.

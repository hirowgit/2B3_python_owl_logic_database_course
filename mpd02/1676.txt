The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a small New World primate, has been
attracting much attention in the research field of biomedical science and
neuroscience, based on its (i) cross-reactivity with human cytokines or hormones,
(ii) comparative ease in handling due to its small size, (iii) high reproductive 
efficiency, (iv) establishment of basic research tools, and (v) advantages of its
unique behavioral and cognitive characters. Various neurological disease models
have been developed in the common marmoset, including Parkinson's disease,
Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, stroke, multiple sclerosis and spinal 
cord injury. We recently developed transgenic common marmoset with germline
transmission, which is expected to provide a new animal model for the study of
human diseases. In this review, we summarize the recent progress of biomedical
research and neuroscience using common marmoset as an excellent model system.

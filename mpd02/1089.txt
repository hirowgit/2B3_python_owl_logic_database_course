White matter abnormalities in the CNS have been reported recently in various
neurological and psychiatric disorders. Quantitation of non-Gaussianity for water
diffusion by q-space diffusional MRI (QSI) renders biological diffusion barriers 
such as myelin sheaths; however, the time-consuming nature of this method hinders
its clinical application. In the current study, we aimed to refine QSI protocols 
to enable their clinical application and to visualize myelin signals in a
clinical setting. For this purpose, animal studies were first performed to
optimize the acquisition protocol of a non-Gaussian QSI metric. The heat map of
standardized kurtosis values derived from optimal QSI (myelin map) was then
created. Histological validation of the myelin map was performed in
myelin-deficient mice and in a nonhuman primate by monitoring its variation
during demyelination and remyelination after chemical spinal cord injury. The
results demonstrated that it was sensitive enough to depict dysmyelination,
demyelination, and remyelination in animal models. Finally, its utility in
clinical practice was assessed by a pilot clinical study in a selected group of
patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). The human myelin map could be obtained
within 10 min with a 3 T MR scanner. Use of the myelin map was practical for
visualizing white matter and it sensitively detected reappearance of myelin
signals after demyelination, possibly reflecting remyelination in MS patients.
Our results together suggest that the myelin map, a kurtosis-related heat map
obtainable with time-saving QSI, may be a novel and clinically useful means of
visualizing myelin in the human CNS.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Myelin abnormalities 
in the CNS have been gaining increasing attention in various neurological and
psychiatric diseases. However, appropriate methods with which to monitor CNS
myelin in daily clinical practice have been lacking. In the current study, we
introduced a novel MRI modality that produces the "myelin map." The myelin map
accurately depicted myelin status in mice and nonhuman primates and in a pilot
clinical study of multiple sclerosis patients, suggesting that it is useful in
detecting possibly remyelinated lesions. A myelin map of the human brain could be
obtained in <10 min using a 3 T scanner and it therefore promises to be a
powerful tool for researchers and clinicians examining myelin-related diseases.

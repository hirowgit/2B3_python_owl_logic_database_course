Quantitative data on the gut proportions of the recently-described black-headed
marmoset (Callithrix nigriceps) from western Brazilian Amazonian are presented.
Like other marmosets, C. nigriceps exhibits a relatively large caecum and colon
associated with adaptations for gummivory. The degree of gut specialisation
recorded is greater than that for any other platyrrhine for which quantitative
data are available. Gum was found in the stomach contents of all four individuals
examined, although the fruit/seeds of as many as seven different plant taxa were 
also encountered, in addition to insects of six different orders. Gut proportions
of two Saguinus labiatus from the same region were typical of the more
frugivorous tamarins, and stomach contents included only fruit and insects.
Relative gut proportions of both species were closely similar to those of
congeners from the same region.

Non-invasive methods for routine monitoring of reproductive states and
reproduction control in large colonies of captive Callithrix jacchus have been
developed. Immunoactive urinary oestrone-3-conjugates (E1C) were measured during 
non-conception cycles (n = 5) and pregnancy (n = 7). Using plasma progesterone
levels to time ovulation, ovulation was quantitatively estimated by a)
calculating the first E1C rise and b) by establishing an E1C threshold. Ovulation
was thus defined as taking place 4 days preceding a) the first rise of E1C above 
follicular-phase levels, or b) a concentration > or = 4.5 micrograms E1C/mg
creatinine. Early pregnancy could be determined after day 20 by continued
luteal-phase levels of E1C. Secondly, the luteolytic effect of cloprostenol,
injected over a wide range of doses and between days 1 and 64 after
ovulation/conception, was analysed. Luteolysis was achieved when cloprostenol was
administered after day 5 post-ovulation; the luteolytic effect was found not to
be dose-dependent. The success of cloprostenol treatment was 87% as confirmed by 
endocrine monitoring. The methods described are effective and minimize
intervention, and are therefore suitable for long-term applications, particularly
in combination with behavioural studies.

Using multiple measures of hand preference, the authors investigated
lateralization at an individual level in 21 common marmosets. Despite showing
group biases for sensory and communication functions, these same marmosets did
not show a group bias in direction of lateralized hand use. Hand preferences were
recorded on four novel reaching tasks requiring different levels of visual
guidance and postural control. As found for simple food holding (with the same
subjects), they displayed strong individual hand preferences but no group bias
indicative of handedness. The strength of hand preference was influenced by task 
demands: stronger preferences were expressed when subjects adopted a suspended
posture, and when "successful" versus "unsuccessful" foraging strategies were
compared. Comparisons between visuospatial reaching and simple food holding
preferences also revealed that half of the subjects displayed a division of
function between the hands/hemispheres; subjects displayed opposing preferences
in simple and visuospatial reaching, which would be beneficial for the
performance of coordinated bimanual tasks. Given the apparent absence of a
selective advantage for handedness, the authors suggest that hand preferences may
reflect hemispheric dominance of other cognitive domains (i.e., temperament).

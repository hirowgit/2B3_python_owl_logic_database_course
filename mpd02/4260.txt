Visual areas V1, V2 and MT (V5) were identified through myeloarchitectonic
criteria and their sizes estimated in a flattened map of caudal cerebral cortex
in the marmoset Callithrix penicillata. The ratio MT/V1 in this species is
similar to values reported for other species of primates, but the ratio V2/V1 in 
Callithrix penicillata is smaller than that in macaques and larger than that in
Aotus. The possible implications of these results are discussed.

Multiple sclerosis is a serious neurological disease that affects 1 in 1000 young
adults in Europe and the USA. The development of an effective therapy for this
enigmatic disease is plagued by the failure of many treatments to reproduce in
patients the promising effects observed in animal models. This review describes a
new preclinical model in a non-human primate that might help to bridge the gap
between currently used animal models and the patients.

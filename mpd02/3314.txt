Multiple sclerosis is a demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system
(CNS), in which an immune attack directed against myelin constituents causes
myelin destruction and death of oligodendrocytes, the myelin-producing cells.
Here, the efficacy of nerve growth factor (NGF), a growth factor for neurons and 
oligodendrocytes, in promoting myelin repair was evaluated using the
demyelinating model of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) in the
common marmoset. Surprisingly, we found that NGF delayed the onset of clinical
EAE and, pathologically, prevented the full development of EAE lesions. We
demonstrate by immunocytochemistry that NGF exerts its antiinflammatory effect by
downregulating the production of interferon gamma by T cells infiltrating the
CNS, and upregulating the production of interleukin 10 by glial cells in both
inflammatory lesions of EAE and normal-appearing CNS white matter. Thus, NGF,
currently under investigation in human clinical trials as a neuronal trophic
factor, may be an attractive candidate for therapy of autoimmune demyelinating
disorders.

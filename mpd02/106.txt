This study was aimed at establishing the subcorticals substrates of the cognitive
and visceromotor circuits of the A32 and A25 cortices of the medial prefrontal
cortex and their projections and interactions with subcortical complexes in the
common marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus). The study was primarily restricted
to the nuclei of the diencephalon and amygdala. The common marmoset is a
neotropical primate of the new world, and the absence of telencephalic gyrus
favors the mapping of neuronal fibers. The biotinylated dextran amine was
employed as an anterograde tracer. There was an evident pattern of rostrocaudal
distribution of fibers within the subcortical nuclei, with medial orientation.
Considering this distribution, fibers originating from the A25 cortex were found 
to be more clustered in the diencephalon and amygdala than those originating in
the A32 cortex. Most areas of the amygdala received fibers from both cortices. In
the diencephalon, all regions received projections from the A32, while the A25
fibers were restricted to the thalamus, hypothalamus, and epithalamus at
different densities. Precise deposits of neuronal tracers provided here may
significantly contribute to expand our understanding of specific connectivity
among the medial prefrontal cortex with limbic regions and diencephalic areas,
key elements to the viscerocognitive process.

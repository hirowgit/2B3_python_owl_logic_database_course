The effects of iodine deficiency on general and craniofacial growth were
determined in young common marmosets. Examinations, including direct measurement,
cephalometric radiology, and dental examination, were performed at three-month
intervals from birth to 1 year on a cross-sectional sample of three groups of
marmosets. The groups were those on a normal diet, n = 50; an iodine-deficient
diet during gestation and for 1 year postnatally, n = 26; and an iodine-deficient
diet only during gestation (returned to a normal diet at 1 month after birth), n 
= 18. The iodine-deficient animals were smaller in all dimensions, compared with 
controls, but they did not have typical cretin facies. Animals that were iodine
deficient during gestation but subsequently fed a normal diet were small
initially but displayed compensatory growth, so that by 1 year they were nearly
normal in size.

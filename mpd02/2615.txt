This chapter describes methods used to investigate implantation in the common
marmoset monkey, Callithrix jacchus. A reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain
reaction-strategy with which to detect transcripts for steroid receptors and
enzymes involved in estradiol biosynthesis is described, and an
immunohistochemistry approach for detecting proteins within the implantation site
is presented.

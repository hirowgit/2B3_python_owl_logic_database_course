Social mammals with more numerous and stronger social relationships live longer, 
healthier lives. Despite the established importance of social relationships, our 
understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms by which they are pursued,
formed, and maintained in primates remains largely confined to highly controlled 
laboratory settings which do not allow natural, dynamic social interactions to
unfold. In this review, we argue that the neurobiological study of primate social
behavior would benefit from adopting a neuroethological approach, that is, a
perspective grounded in natural, species-typical behavior, with careful selection
of animal models according to the scientific question at hand. We highlight
macaques and marmosets as key animal models for human social behavior and
summarize recent findings in the social domain for both species. We then review
pioneering studies of dynamic social behaviors in small animals, which can
inspire studies in larger primates where the technological landscape is now ripe 
for an ethological overhaul.

OBJECTIVE: To report normal tear production of healthy adult black-tufted
marmosets and propose a novel alternative for the measurement of the aqueous
portion of tear production in animals with small eyes.
ANIMAL STUDIED: Black-tufted marmosets (Callithrix penicillata).
PROCEDURES: Tear production of 19 animals was evaluated by the following methods:
modified Schirmer's I, phenol red thread and the novel use of standardized
endodontic absorbent paper points. These methods and results were compared.
Additionally, blink frequency and palpebral fissure length were measured.
RESULTS: Modified Schirmer's test I, mean = -0.46 ± 3.41 mm/min; Phenol red
thread, mean = 13.27 ± 5.41 mm/15 s.; Standardized endodontic paper points, size 
30, mean = 9.32 ± 3.09 mm/min; Mean palpebral fissure length = 7.83 ± 0.72 mm.
Blink frequency, mean = 20.27 ± 5.92/5 min.
CONCLUSIONS: Normal parameters for blink frequency, palpebral fissure length and 
tear production measurement are presented. The palpebral fissure of black-tufted 
marmoset is very small and tear production is one of the lowest reported for all 
animal species. A novel and practical alternative for tear production measurement
using standardized endodontic absorbent paper points is presented and is
indicated for animals with small eyes.

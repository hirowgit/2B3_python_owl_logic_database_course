Visualization and biopsy of the colon in tamarins and marmosets by endoscopy.

Clapp NK, McArthur AH, Carson RL, Henke MA, Peck OC, Wood JD.

Endoscopic visualization and biopsy have been performed under anesthesia in more 
than 65 tamarins and marmosets to study the pathogenesis of colitis and cancer of
the colon. This procedure allows examination of the large bowel from the anus to 
the cecum and has been repeated at 2-6 month intervals with few complications.
However, care must be exercised not to perforate the colon. Successful use of
this technique will permit study of the pathogenesis of colonic diseases
throughout the life of the animal and should provide cause-effect information
about colitis and colon cancer in tamarins that may apply to the human diseases.

This study describes the concentrations of melatonin in plasma samples taken from
marmoset monkeys (Callithrix jacchus) every 4 h over three 24-h periods. A
circadian pattern of secretion was apparent, with higher levels recorded at night
(20.00-08.00 h) than during the day (08.00-20.00 h) and a peak concentration at
20.00 h. There was a significant difference in the mean day and night
concentrations (32.5 ± 4.5 pg/ml versus 49.0 ± 6.9 pg/ml, respectively) with
individual concentrations ranging between<10-60 pg/ml in the day and 15-200 pg/ml
at night. Circadian plasma melatonin concentrations were similar over the three
24-h periods, in male (n = 3) and female (n = 3) monkeys, and in dominant
(cyclic, n = 5) and subordinate (acyclic, n = 4) females. The results show a less
pronounced circadian profile in the marmoset than is seen in the human but a
similar profile to that in the seasonally breeding rhesus monkey.

Isolates of Bordetella bronchiseptica associated with different animal hosts were
analysed by fim3 and flaA genotyping by temporal temperature gradient gel
electrophoresis (TTGE). All the isolates from cats (n = 138), dogs (n = 42) and
pigs (n = 13) could be assigned to one of two fim3 and one of three flaA TTGE
sequence types, respectively. Two avian isolates and a marmoset isolate exhibited
novel fim3 sequence types. Dominant but different TTGE sequence types were
apparent in isolates from dogs and pigs for both fim3 (87.5% and 100%,
respectively, of isolates were the dominant type) and flaA (95% and 92%,
respectively, of isolates were the dominant type). There was a wider distribution
of TTGE sequence types amongst cat isolates. As both fimbriae and flagella have
been implicated in adherence of bordetellae to host cells, sequence variations in
fimbrial proteins and FlaA may have a role to play in host preferences.

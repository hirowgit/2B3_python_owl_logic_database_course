Nonspecific monoamine reuptake inhibitors reverse motor abnormalities in
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated marmosets without
evoking established dyskinesia. However, it is not known whether dopamine
reuptake inhibition alone explains these actions or whether noradrenaline and/or 
serotonin reuptake blockade also contributes. L-DOPA (12.5 mg/kg, p.o.) rapidly
reversed the baseline locomotor deficits and motor disabilities, but evoked
dyskinesia (especially limb chorea) in MPTP-treated common marmosets primed to
exhibit involuntary movements. In contrast, the selective dopamine reuptake
inhibitor 1-(2-(bis-(4-fluorophenyl)-methoxy)ethyl)-4-(3-phenylpropyl) piperazine
dihydrochloride (GBR 12909) reversed motor deficits in a dose-dependent manner
but, unlike L-DOPA, did not evoke established dyskinesia in these animals.
Therefore, inhibition of dopamine reuptake does not evoke established dyskinesia 
in MPTP-treated primates.

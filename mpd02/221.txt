While task-dependent changes have been demonstrated in auditory cortex for a
number of behavioral paradigms and mammalian species, less is known about how
behavioral state can influence neural coding in the midbrain areas that provide
auditory information to cortex. We measured single-unit activity in the inferior 
colliculus (IC) of common marmosets of both sexes while they performed a
tone-in-noise detection task and during passive presentation of identical task
stimuli. In contrast to our previous study in the ferret IC, task engagement had 
little effect on sound-evoked activity in central (lemniscal) IC of the marmoset.
However, activity was significantly modulated in noncentral fields, where
responses were selectively enhanced for the target tone relative to the
distractor noise. This led to an increase in neural discriminability between
target and distractors. The results confirm that task engagement can modulate
sound coding in the auditory midbrain, and support a hypothesis that subcortical 
pathways can mediate highly trained auditory behaviors.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT
While the cerebral cortex is widely viewed as playing an essential role in the
learning and performance of complex auditory behaviors, relatively little
attention has been paid to the role of brainstem and midbrain areas that process 
sound information before it reaches cortex. This study demonstrates that the
auditory midbrain is also modulated during behavior. These modulations amplify
task-relevant sensory information, a process that is traditionally attributed to 
cortex.

BACKGROUND: Many human diseases are modulated by intrauterine environment, which 
is called prenatal programming. This study investigated effects of prenatal
glucocorticoids on the lipid metabolism of three filial generations of common
marmosets.
METHODS: Pregnant primates were treated with dexamethasone during pregnancy. Body
weight and blood lipid parameters of adult female offspring (F1: n = 5, F2: n =
6, F3: n = 3) were compared with age-related female controls (n = 12).
RESULTS: F1, F2, and F3 offspring showed significantly lower percentage of plasma
n3 fatty acids than controls. F2 and F3 presented higher cholesterol levels, with
significantly more LDL cholesterol, significantly less HDL triglycerides and an
enhanced cholesterol/HDL cholesterol ratio. Body weight was not significantly
affected.
CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal dexamethasone led to higher amounts of cardiovascular risk 
factors and less protective parameters in female F1-F3 offspring. The
intergenerational consequences suggest prenatal programming through epigenetic
effects.

The neurotoxin MPTP induces nigral dopaminergic cell death in primates and
produces a partial model of Parkinson's disease (PD). Pramipexole is a D2/D3
dopamine receptor agonist used in the symptomatic treatment of PD, and which also
protects neuronal cells against dopaminergic toxins in vitro. We now demonstrate 
that pramipexole partially prevents MPTP toxicity in vivo in a primate species.
Common marmosets were repeatedly treated with pramipexole either before,
coincidentally with, or after low-dose MPTP treatment designed to induce a
partial lesion of the substantia nigra. Animals pretreated with pramipexole had a
significantly greater number of surviving tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) positive
neurones in the pars compacta of the substantia nigra. Pramipexole pretreatment
also prevented degeneration of striatal dopamine terminals. Treatment with
pramipexole concurrently with MPTP or following MPTP did not prevent TH-positive 
cell loss. Pramipexole pretreatment appears to induce adaptive changes that
protect against dopaminergic cell loss in primates.

Disruption of microbial communities within human hosts has been associated with
infection, obesity, cognitive decline, cancer risk and frailty, suggesting that
microbiome-targeted therapies may be an option for improving healthspan and
lifespan. The objectives of this study were to determine the feasibility of
delivering fecal microbiota transplants (FMTs) to marmosets via oral gavage and
to evaluate if alteration of the gut microbiome post-FMT could be achieved. This 
was a prospective study of marmosets housed at the Barshop Institute for
Longevity and Aging Studies in San Antonio, Texas. Eligible animals included
healthy young adult males (age 2-5 years) with no recent medication use. Stool
from two donors was combined and administered in 0.5 ml doses to five young
recipients once weekly for 3 weeks. Safety outcomes and alterations in the gut
microbiome composition via 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing were compared at baseline
and monthly up to 6 months post-FMT. Overall, significant differences in the
percent relative abundance was seen in FMT recipients at the phylum and family
levels from baseline to 1 month and baseline to 6 months post-FMT. In
permutational multivariate analysis of variance analyses, treatment status (donor
vs. recipient) (p = .056) and time course (p = .019) predicted β diversity
(p = .056). The FMT recipients did not experience any negative health outcomes
over the course of the treatment. FMT via oral gavage was safe to administer to
young adult marmosets. The marmoset microbiome may be altered by FMT; however,
progressive changes in the microbiome are strongly driven by the host and its
baseline microbiome composition.

Subchronic pretreatment with physostigmine (PHY) (0.0125 mg/kg/h) leading to a
blood acetylcholinesterase inhibition of about 30% caused no side effects when
applied to marmoset monkeys. This was evident on behavioral parameters and on EEG
and cortical visual evoked response. Furthermore, this treatment regime, followed
by atropine as postintoxication therapy, protected the marmosets against
lethality after a 2 x LD50 dose of soman with negligible postintoxication
incapacitation. These findings suggest that a symptom-free pretreatment with
subchronic PHY could protect man sufficiently against severe soman intoxication.

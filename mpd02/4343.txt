Pheromonal signals from the dominant female marmoset monkey were implicated in
maintaining the suppression of LH secretion and ovulation in socially subordinate
females. When subordinate, and reproductively suppressed, female marmoset monkeys
were removed from their group without scent contact with their dominant females, 
subordinate females in control group 1 (N = 8) and control group 2 (N = 5),
ovulated 10.8 +/- 1.4 days and 10.4 +/- 0.8 days respectively (mean +/- s.e.m.)
after separation. Subordinate females (N = 8) removed from their dominant female 
and group, but maintained in scent contact only with their dominant females,
showed a delay in the onset of ovulation (31.0 +/- 6.4 days) compared with
control groups 1 and 2. Plasma LH concentrations of subordinate females during
the scent transfer phase were lower than in controls without scent transfer and
comparable to those seen whilst the females were subordinates in groups. Contact 
of subordinate females with olfactory stimuli from dominant females therefore
maintains the suppression of both LH secretion and ovulation in socially
subordinate female marmosets. Such pheromonal cues provide evidence of a
quantifiable link between dominant female marmosets and the maintenance of
physiological suppression of reproduction in their female subordinates.

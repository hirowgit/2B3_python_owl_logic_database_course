Proper care of callitrichids (marmosets and tamarins) requires a thorough
understanding of the natural history, nutritional requirements, and husbandry
requirements of these small delicate monkeys. This article provides information
to formulate appropriate diets, to bottle-feed a rejected infant, to learn normal
behaviors, to give an overview of nutritionally related diseases and treatments, 
provide information about husbandry, and to provide an overview of infectious
diseases. Veterinarians will be better able to assist callitrichid owners in
their proper care with the information provided in this article.

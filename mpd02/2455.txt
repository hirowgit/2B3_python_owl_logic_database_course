The phylogenetic affinities of the neotropical Goeldi's monkey (Callimico
goeldii) have long been a matter of debate. Whereas most morphological evidence
appears to place Callimico in a sister group position relative to the
Callitrichidae, genetic studies place C. goeldii within the Callitrichidae and
suggest that it is more closely related to marmosets than to tamarins. The
present study presents the first radiographic analysis comparing the secondary
limb bone ossification of newborn C. goeldii with representatives of the
marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) and tamarins (Saguinus oedipus). The state of
secondary ossification of the epiphysis and short bones is classified into three 
different ontogenetic stages. Our results reveal that in terms of the number of
ossification centers, C. goeldii is significantly closer to C. jacchus than to S.
oedipus. This is the first morphological study to support the findings of
molecular studies, and the results suggest that C. goeldii is more closely
related to marmosets than to tamarins.

OBJECTIVE: Increasing prevalence of childhood obesity and associated risks of
adult type disease have led to worldwide concern. It remains unclear how genetic 
predisposition, environmental exposure to obesogenic food, and developmental
programming interact to lead to overweight and obese children. The development of
a nonhuman primate model of obesity, and particularly juvenile obesity, is an
important step to elucidating the factors associated with obesity and evaluating 
intervention strategies.
DESIGN AND METHODS: Infant marmosets were followed from birth to 12 months of
age. Feeding phenotypes were determined through the use of behavioral
observation, solid food intake trials, and liquid feeding trials monitored via
lickometer.
RESULTS: Marmosets found to be obese at 12 months of age (more than 14% body fat)
start consuming solid food sooner and initiate more time off of care givers.
These individuals developed stable feeding phenotypes that included being more
efficient consumers during liquid intake trials, drinking more grams of diet per 
contact with the licksit.
CONCLUSIONS: The weaning process appears to be particularly important in the
development of feeding phenotypes and the development of juvenile obesity for the
marmosets, and thus this is the time that should be focused upon for intervention
testing in both nonhuman primates and children.

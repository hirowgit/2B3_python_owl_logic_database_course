The advantages of living in a group include feeding benefits and/or predation
avoidance, while the disadvantages are typically related to competition. One way 
to avoid competition while maintaining the benefits of living in a group is to
form interspecific associations with species with relatively little dietary
overlap. Here we report a stable association between a male golden-headed lion
tamarin (GHLT), Leontopithecus chrysomelas, and a group of Wied's
black-tufted-ear marmosets (WBTMs), Callithrix kuhlii. We collected ecological
and behavioral data on a duo of GHLTs from May to August 2008, totaling 62 h of
observations. On 19 August 2008, the radio-collared GHLT dispersed alone and was 
located on 28 August in association with WBTMs. To examine possible changes in
GHLT ecology and behavior, we monitored the mixed-species group between September
and December 2008, totaling 122 h of observations. We found that the GHLT's home 
range and daily path length decreased by about ten and three times, respectively,
after joining the WBTM group, suggesting adaptations to the WBTMs' use of space. 
All non-agonistic behaviors recorded in the mixed group were directed from GHLT
to the WBMTs, whereas all agonistic interactions were directed from the WBMTs to 
the GHLT, indicating a subordinate position of GHLT in the mixed group. In golden
lion tamarins, reproductive success of subordinate adult males that remain in the
group is higher than that of those that disperse and "prospect" for a breeding
opportunity. If dispersing individuals are unable to find a mate and defend a
territory, they will likely die within a year. The dispersing GHLT in this study 
assumed a subordinate role in a mixed-species group outside a GHLT territory.
Apparently, the benefits of waiting for a dispersing female in a relatively safe 
situation may exceed the costs of prospecting elsewhere or being a subordinate.

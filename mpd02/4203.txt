Cephalosporins with new catechol substituents at C-3' have been synthesized,
including novel compounds with C-3' carbon-carbon bonds. Many of these compounds 
have high potency against Gram-negative bacteria, in particular against resistant
strains like Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Structure-activity relationships are
discussed in terms of their dependence on the pKa of the C-3' catechol and also
in terms of steric and conformational factors of the C-3' substituent. The best
overall properties were found in compounds with a bulky and/or conformationally
restricted acidic C-3' catechol.

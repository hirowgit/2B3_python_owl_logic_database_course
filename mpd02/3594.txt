Treatment of Parkinson's disease with L-dopa therapy leads to long-term
complications, including loss of drug efficacy and the onset of dyskinesia.
Adenosine A2A receptors in striatum are selectively localized to GABAergic output
neurons of the striato-pallidal pathway and may avoid such problems. The novel
adenosine A2A receptor antagonist KW-6002 has been examined for antiparkinsonian 
activity in MPTP-treated primates. Oral administration of KW-6002 reversed motor 
disability in MPTP-treated common marmosets in a dose-dependent manner. However, 
KW-6002 only modestly increased overall locomotor activity and did not cause
abnormal movement, such as stereotypy. The ability of KW-6002 to reverse motor
disability was maintained on repeated daily administration for 21 days, and no
tolerance was observed. KW-6002 induced little or no dyskinesia in MPTP-treated
primates previously primed to exhibit dyskinesia by prior exposure to L-dopa.
These results suggest that selective adenosine A2A receptor antagonists represent
a new class of antiparkinsonian agents that improve disability without producing 
hyperactivity and without inducing dyskinesia.

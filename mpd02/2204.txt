Cortical asymmetries are well established in humans for language and motor
regions and correlate with handedness. Here the authors investigate structural
differences in the hemispheres of left- and right-handed common marmosets using
surface photography and histology. The hand preferences of 11 marmosets were
assessed over their adult life span using a simple reaching task. A significant
correlation was found between the length of the right lateral sulcus/brain weight
and the % right-hand preference (r = .86, p = .001). Cortical thickness on the
superior bank of the right lateral sulcus posteriorly was also positively
correlated with % right-hand preference (r = .69, p = .025). Comparison of this
site with previously published functional maps of the marmoset cortex show this
area corresponds to SII, a region involved in tactile processing and
somatosensory discriminations. It is suggested that the correlation between SII
thickness and right-hand preference would be consistent with the fact that
right-handed marmosets are more proactive than left-handers in exploring novel
objects by touch. Enlargement of a cortical area involved tactile discriminations
could be a precursor to the evolution of right-handedness as a population bias.

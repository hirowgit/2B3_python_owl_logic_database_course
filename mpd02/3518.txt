Most genera of New World primates exhibit a compensated form of resistance to
steroid hormones produced by the adrenal gland, gonads, and kidney. Estrogen
resistance in New World primate cells is associated with the relative
overexpression of a nonreceptor-related estrogen response element-binding protein
(ERE-BP) that competes with estrogen receptor for ERE binding. Using the
concatamerized ERE half-site (AGGTCAcag) in DNA affinity chromatography, we
purified to homogeneity a 40-42-kDa ERE-BP. The affinity-purified ERE-BP bound
specifically to either single- or double-stranded DNA bearing the consensus ERE
half-site motif AGGTCA. Four distinct internal tryptic peptides from this protein
were generated and shown to exhibit sequence similarity to proteins in the
heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein family. These tryptic peptide fragments
were used to generate a series of degenerate oligonucleotides that were
successfully employed in isolating a full-length ERE-BP cDNA by polymerase chain 
reaction. Although a member of a family of proteins generally recognized for
their ability to bind single strand RNA, the estrogen resistance-associated
protein ERE-BP can effectively bind double strand DNA and competitively squelch
estrogen receptor-directed transactivation.

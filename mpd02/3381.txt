Tumor necrosis factor alpha convertase (TACE), the enzyme responsible for the
processing of pro-TNFalpha to TNFalpha, has been reported to be a
metalloproteinase closely related to matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Current
inhibitors of TACE such as succinate-based hydroxamic acids exemplified by
Marimastat (TACE IC(50): 3.8 nM; blood IC(50): 7 microM) and BB1101 (TACE IC(50):
0.2 nM; blood IC(50): 2.3 microM) suffer from modest potency in blood and poor in
vivo properties. The introduction of new bulky alpha-substituents into these
succinate-based hydroxamic acids was studied. Substituents such as thioethers,
sulfonamides, and ethers showed improved potency against TACE when compared with 
Marimastat. Although this improvement did not translate into better blood potency
for thioether or ether substituents, the sulfonamide series exhibited improved
potency both against TACE and in blood when compared with Marimastat.
Optimization of this sulfonamide series has culminated in the identification of
heterocyclic bicyclic sulfonamides such as 3t (TACE IC(50): 0.57 nM; blood
IC(50): 0.28 microM).

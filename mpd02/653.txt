To understand brain circuits of cognitive behaviors under natural conditions, we 
developed techniques for imaging neuronal activities from large neuronal
populations in the deep layer cortex of the naturally behaving common marmoset.
Animals retrieved food pellets or climbed ladders as a miniature fluorescence
microscope monitored hundreds of calcium indicator-expressing cortical neurons in
the right primary motor cortex. This technique, which can be adapted to other
brain regions, can deepen our understanding of brain circuits by facilitating
longitudinal population analyses of neuronal representation associated with
cognitive naturalistic behaviors and their pathophysiological processes.

Idiopathic myelofibrosis (agnogenic myeloid metaplasia) in a marmoset (Callithrix
jacchus): hematologic and histopathologic changes.

Khan KN, Logan AC, Blomquist EM.

Idiopathic myelofibrosis (IMF), or agnogenic myeloid metaplasia, was diagnosed in
a sexually mature male marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) based on the results of
hematology and histopathologic evaluation of the bone marrow. The hematologic
changes included pancytopenia, leukoerythroblastosis, anisocytosis,
poikilocytosis, and giant platelets. Histopathologic evaluation of the bone
marrow showed marked widespread fibrosis replacing hematopoietic cells and the
presence of atypical megakaryocytes. In addition, slight multifocal osteolysis
with an increase in serum alkaline phosphatase activity was observed. We believe 
this is the first report of IMF in a nonhuman primate species.

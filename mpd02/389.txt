The hippocampus comprises two neural signals-place cells and θ oscillations-that 
contribute to facets of spatial navigation. Although their complementary
relationship has been well established in rodents, their respective contributions
in the primate brain during free navigation remains unclear. Here, we recorded
neural activity in the hippocampus of freely moving marmosets as they naturally
explored a spatial environment to more explicitly investigate this issue. We
report place cells in marmoset hippocampus during free navigation that exhibit
remarkable parallels to analogous neurons in other mammalian species. Although θ 
oscillations were prevalent in the marmoset hippocampus, the patterns of activity
were notably different than in other taxa. This local field potential oscillation
occurred in short bouts (approximately .4 s)-rather than continuously-and was
neither significantly modulated by locomotion nor consistently coupled to
place-cell activity. These findings suggest that the relationship between
place-cell activity and θ oscillations in primate hippocampus during free
navigation differs substantially from rodents and paint an intriguing comparative
picture regarding the neural basis of spatial navigation across mammals.

Aerial and terrestrial visual scanning were investigated in captive black
tufted-ear marmosets, Callithrix penicillata, exposed to a novel environment.
Naive adult subjects (n=24) were individually exposed to a figure-eight maze
during seven 30-min trials, 48 h apart. Habituation to the maze was observed, as 
indicated by the significant decrease in locomotion. The frequency of aerial
scanning, however, remained elevated throughout the 7 trials, while its duration 
rapidly increased to high levels. Frequency and duration of terrestrial scanning 
persisted at constant low rates, differing significantly from aerial scanning.
Males and females did not differ significantly. The different impact of aerial
versus terrestrial predators could have a significant influence on vigilant
behaviour in this species. Thus, visual scanning is an important and highly
organized antipredation strategy in marmosets.

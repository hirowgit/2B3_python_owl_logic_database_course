A marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) with atypical external genitalia was
phenotypically and genetically characterized. Testosterone concentration
correlated with that of female marmosets. Externally, there was only one opening 
for the urethra. Internal genitalia were characteristic of those of female
marmosets, and consisted of ovaries, with follicles in various developmental
stages, and uterus. Microscopically, a normal vaginal structure was found. An
XX/XY chimerism and high steroid hormone values are normally found in common
marmosets. Genetic analysis was used for in vivo determination of sex. The
Y-linked zinc finger protein gene (ZFY) last intron, and sex-determining region Y
gene (SRY) exon were found by use of polymerase chain reaction and posterior
sequencing analyses, indicating that this marmoset had Y-linked chromosome
sequences. Normal SRY exons can, therefore, be associated with female internal
sexual organs in marmosets; this may be the first XY female described in
non-human primates.

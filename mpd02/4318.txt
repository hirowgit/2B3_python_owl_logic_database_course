Immunohistochemical knowledge of the distribution of the collagen types in the
cementum and periodontal ligament were reported in this paper. Because of the
different localization of each of these collagenous components in the two
periodontal tissues its function in the matrix was explored. It was also possible
to clarify the role of collagen in healthy periodontium as well as in
regeneration and wound healing mechanisms.

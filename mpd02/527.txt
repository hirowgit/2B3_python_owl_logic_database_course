Platy-1 elements are Platyrrhine-specific, short interspersed elements originally
discovered in the Callithrix jacchus (common marmoset) genome. To date, only the 
marmoset genome has been analyzed for Platy-1 repeat content. Here, we report
full-length Platy-1 insertions in other New World monkey (NWM) genomes (Saimiri
boliviensis, squirrel monkey; Cebus imitator, capuchin monkey; and Aotus
nancymaae, owl monkey) and analyze the amplification dynamics of lineage-specific
Platy-1 insertions. A relatively small number of full-length and lineage-specific
Platy-1 elements were found in the squirrel, capuchin, and owl monkey genomes
compared with the marmoset genome. In addition, only a few older Platy-1
subfamilies were recovered in this study, with no Platy-1 subfamilies younger
than Platy-1-6. By contrast, 62 Platy-1 subfamilies were discovered in the
marmoset genome. All of the lineage-specific insertions found in the squirrel and
capuchin monkeys were fixed present. However, ∼15% of the lineage-specific
Platy-1 loci in Aotus were polymorphic for insertion presence/absence. In
addition, two new Platy-1 subfamilies were identified in the owl monkey genome
with low nucleotide divergences compared with their respective consensus
sequences, suggesting minimal ongoing retrotransposition in the Aotus genus and
no current activity in the Saimiri, Cebus, and Sapajus genera. These comparative 
analyses highlight the finding that the high number of Platy-1 elements
discovered in the marmoset genome is an exception among NWM analyzed thus far,
rather than the rule. Future studies are needed to expand upon our knowledge of
Platy-1 amplification in other NWM genomes.

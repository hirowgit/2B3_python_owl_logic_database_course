To analyze decision making under uncertainty of monkeys, common marmosets were
trained to choose and remove one of two colored caps on wells arranged side by
side. Each well contained constant reward (3 grains of puffed rice) or risky
reward (0 or 6 grains; probability, 50%:50%). For each marmoset, white or black
color was assigned randomly as a symbol of non-risky or risky choice. Arrangement
of white and black caps was determined randomly in each trial. After 200 trials
(5 trials per day), the marmosets were classified according to the pattern of
their choice. Eight of 18 marmosets (44.4%) were risk-aversive, whereas 5
marmosets (27.8%) were risk-prone. The remaining 5 marmosets (27.8%) preferred to
choose one side (left n=4, right n=1). These results showed individual
differences in decision making of marmosets. An additional task with reduction in
the expected value of the preferred choice revealed that risk-aversive marmosets 
were slower to adjust their choices to such reductions than risk-prone animals.

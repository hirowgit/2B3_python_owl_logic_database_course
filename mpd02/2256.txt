Food transfer is considered to provide infants with additional nutrients during
weaning, and in fact, its frequency peaks around this time. However, the
mechanisms underlying such food transfer remain unclear. In this study, we
investigated whether adult common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) change their
tolerance to offspring begging for food depending on the offspring's age. We used
four families consisting of breeding pairs, older offspring (29-49 weeks old),
and younger offspring (7-15 weeks old). To directly compare the responses of a
parent with its older and younger offspring, we placed one parent and one
offspring in a testing space at one time. We presented foods where only the
parent could reach them to ensure that the foods were transferred from the parent
to offspring. Younger offspring showed more interest in food being held by the
parents than older offspring. Parents refused older offspring more frequently
than younger offspring and transferred food more often to younger offspring than 
to older offspring. There was no difference in all behavioral categories between 
fathers and mothers. These results suggest that both fathers and mothers are more
tolerant to weanlings, but their tolerance decreases as offspring mature.

In this report, a method is presented for gaining direct access to cortical areas
within the lateral fissure of primates for neuroanatomical tracer injections and 
electrode array implantation. Compared to areas on the surface of the brain, the 
anatomical and physiological properties of areas within the fissure are poorly
understood. Typically, access to these areas is indirectly achieved by ablating
or passing through intervening areas. To enable direct experimental access, a
neurosurgical technique was developed in primates whereby the banks of the
lateral fissure were retracted with sparing of the vascular network and
intervening areas. In some animals, anatomical tracers were directly injected
into target fields without contamination of other areas. In others, multichannel 
electrode arrays were implanted into target areas for chronic recording of neural
activity. Since, these techniques could be adapted for exploration of areas
within other sulci, the approach represents an important advance in efforts to
elucidate the functional organization of the primate cerebral cortex.

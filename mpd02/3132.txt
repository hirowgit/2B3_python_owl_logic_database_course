Because auditory cortical neurons have limited stimulus-synchronized responses,
cortical representations of more rapidly occurring but still perceivable stimuli 
remain unclear. Here we show that there are two largely distinct populations of
neurons in the auditory cortex of awake primates: one with stimulus-synchronized 
discharges that, with a temporal code, explicitly represented slowly occurring
sound sequences and the other with non-stimulus-synchronized discharges that,
with a rate code, implicitly represented rapidly occurring events. Furthermore,
neurons of both populations displayed selectivity in their discharge rates to
temporal features within a short time-window. Our results suggest that the
combination of temporal and rate codes in the auditory cortex provides a possible
neural basis for the wide perceptual range of temporal information.

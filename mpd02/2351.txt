A novel nerve bundle containing thin muscle fibers in the posterior
cricoarytenoid muscle of the marmoset.

Desaki J, Nishida N.

We examined a novel nerve bundle in the posterior cricoarytenoid muscle of the
marmoset. This intramuscular nerve bundle contained two thin muscle fibers about 
10 microm in diameter, like intrafusal muscle fibers in the muscle spindle. These
thin muscle fibers were individually surrounded by nerve bundles consisting of
numerous nonmyelinated nerve fibers. Individual nerve axons contained clear
synaptic vesicles and large granulated vesicles, being possibly cholinergic
(parasympathetic) in nature. These nerve axons were often in contact with the
muscle fiber with and without an interposing basal lamina. Two thin muscle fibers
gradually terminated in the endoneural connective tissue around myelinated and
nonmyelinated nerve fibers during their course. The innervation of thin muscle
fibers in the novel nerve bundle is briefly discussed.

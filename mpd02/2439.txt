Grooming as a reward? Social function of grooming between females in
cooperatively breeding marmosets.

Lazaro-Perea C, DE FÃ¡tima Arruda M, Snowdon CT.

Classical models of grooming predict that subordinate primates will direct
grooming towards dominants to receive coalitionary support from them. In
contrast, recent reviews suggest that grooming asymmetries can change with social
system and ecological conditions and should reflect asymmetries in services
provided by different members of the dyad. We studied grooming patterns between
females in six wild groups of common marmosets, Callithrix jacchus, to
investigate the relation between social structure and grooming between females in
a cooperatively breeding species. We observed grooming frequently and
consistently in all study groups. Breeding females groomed nonbreeding females
more than vice versa, and grooming between breeding and nonbreeding females was
not related to agonistic behaviour. Our results provide some support to the
hypothesis that grooming asymmetries are related to differences in services
provided by different group members. We suggest that, in cooperatively breeding
systems, breeding females may use grooming as an incentive for helper females to 
stay in the group.

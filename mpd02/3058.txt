In view of the increasing need for laboratory primates in biomedical research it 
is desirable to develop appropriate primate-specific cell culture models that
could prevent or significantly reduce the increasing use of primary cultures and 
experiments with living animals. Follicular granulosa and theca cells are
essential for the control of hormone-dependent processes such as the ovarian
cycle and pregnancy, but also for the occurrence of hormone-dependent diseases.
For this reason it is of great interest to know more about control mechanisms
existing in these follicular cell types and the effect of pharmacological or
toxicological agents on them. An immortalisation protocol for the two ovarian
cell types of the marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus) has been developed. All
cell lines established so far were examined with regard to the maintenance of
known, tissue-specific features (e.g. hormone responsiveness and enzyme
expression). The results obtained indicate that it is worth while cloning and
characterising the cell lines in more detail so that they could be used after an 
adequate validation as a defined test system both for basic research as well as
for pharmacological or toxicological screening.

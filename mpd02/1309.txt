Protocol for metagenomic virus detection in clinical specimens.

Sixty percent of emerging viruses have a zoonotic origin, making transmission
from animals a major threat to public health. Prompt identification and analysis 
of these pathogens are indispensable to taking action toward prevention and
protection of the affected population. We quantifiably compared classical and
modern approaches of virus purification and enrichment in theory and experiments.
Eventually, we established an unbiased protocol for detection of known and novel 
emerging viruses from organ tissues (tissue-based universal virus detection for
viral metagenomics [TUViD-VM]). The final TUViD-VM protocol was extensively
validated by using real-time PCR and next-generation sequencing. We could
increase the amount of detectable virus nucleic acids and improved the detection 
of viruses <75,000-fold compared with other tested approaches. This TUViD-VM
protocol can be used in metagenomic and virome studies to increase the likelihood
of detecting viruses from any biological source.

Advanced magnetic resonance (MR) neuroimaging analysis techniques based on
voxel-wise statistics, such as voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and functional MRI, 
are widely applied to cognitive brain research in both human subjects and in
non-human primates. Recent developments in imaging have enabled the evaluation of
smaller animal models with sufficient spatial resolution. The common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus), a small New World primate species, has been widely used in 
neuroscience research, to which voxel-wise statistics could be extended with a
species-specific brain template. Here, we report, for the first time, a
tissue-segmented, population-averaged standard template of the common marmoset
brain. This template was created by using anatomical T(1)-weighted images from 22
adult marmosets with a high-resolution isotropic voxel size of (0.2 mm)(3) at
7-Tesla and DARTEL algorithm in SPM8. Whole brain templates are available at
International Neuroinformatics Japan Node website,

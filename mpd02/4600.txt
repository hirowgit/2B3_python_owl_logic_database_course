Forelimb anatomy of New World monkeys: myology and the interpretation of
primitive anthropoid models.

Dunlap SS, Thorington RW Jr, Aziz MA.

The forelimbs of 12 genera of New World monkeys, two genera of Old World monkeys,
and a gibbon were dissected. Of the 54 muscles examined, 19 exhibited significant
intergeneric variation. We present arguments for which morphologies are primitive
and which are derived within platyrrhines and within anthropoids. We conclude
that the forelimbs of Cebus apella and Callicebus moloch represent good models of
the ancestral anthropoid morphology. Thus among living anthropoids they are most 
appropriate for comparisons with early fossil anthropoids. They are also useful
for determining whether myological anomalies of human aneuploids are atavistic.
Wagner tree analyses were conducted to assess the value of these myological
characters in phylogenetic studies of platyrrhines. In most respects the Wagner
trees were consonant with phylogenies previously proposed, although some
hypothesized trees are less parsimonious than others in explaining our data.
There is an unexpected number of derived features shared by Aotus and the
Atelines. There are marked dissimilarities in forelimb musculature between Aotus 
and Callicebus.

The embryology of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).

Phillips IR.

Earlier studies have noted the unusual placental anatomy of marmosets and the
high frequency of biovular, synchorial twinning. The maintenance of a captive
colony of Callithrix jacchus has enabled further studies to be made of embryonic 
development in this species. Thirty-six embryos from seventeen pregnancies were
examined in detail and assigned to horizons on the basis of Streeter's
classification of external form and internal structure. The specimens represented
tha major part of the embryonic period and, with few exceptions, the structural
development of the marmoset closely resembled that of the other primates that
have been described. Marmoset embryos of a given horizon were consistently
shorter than those of man. The timing of morphogenesis in C. jacchus was
different from that observed in man and other primates. There was a considerable 
delay in early embryogenesis in the marmoset, although subsequent to stage XI,
development proceeded at approximately the same rate as other primates. The
available evidence suggested that this anomaly was not due to delayed
implantation or embryonic diapause but to a generally slower rate of early
development. The evolution of synchorial twinning is considered as a possible
reason for this mode of development.

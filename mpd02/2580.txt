The subjects of the study were 1,249 primates of different species, kept in a
nursery in the city of Adler. The subjects varied in age, were either clinically 
healthy, diseased, or dead (the death had been caused by an acute intestinal
disease). Biological, molecular-genetic (PCR), and immunological (coagglutination
reaction) methods were used in diagnostics of campilobacter infections. The study
found campilobacter in 20.9% of healthy animals on the average; this number
varied depending on the species and age. The frequency of campilobacter infection
in diseased and dead animals was higher than that in healthy ones (40.1% and
20.9%, respectively.) Two types of Campilobacter were identified: C. jejuni
(73.4% of cases), and C. coli (14.2%). Clinical and pathomorphological
manifestations of campilobacteriosis in primates and humans are similar. The
portion of campilobacteriosis in acute intestinal diseases of primates is 40.1%.

Microelectrode implants are an important tool in neuroscience research and in
developing brain⁻machine interfaces. Data from rodents have consistently shown
that astrocytes are recruited to the area surrounding implants, forming a glial
scar that increases electrode impedance and reduces chronic utility. However,
studies in non-human primates are scarce, with none to date in marmosets. We used
glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunostaining to characterize the acute
and chronic response of the marmoset brain to microelectrodes. By using
densitometry, we showed that marmoset astrocytes surround brain implants and that
a glial scar is formed over time, with significant increase in the chronic
condition relative to the acute condition animal.

There are few papers about physiological indices in Callithrix penicillata, an
increasing primate model in biomedicine. We investigated levels of plasmatic
cortisol, plasmatic glucose, free fatty acids, blood cells, tympanic temperature,
rectal temperature in C. penicllata, under a fast restraint. Measures of body and
weight were accomplished. Males and females were not different regarding any
measurements. Body measurements indicated differences between adults and
juveniles. Adults showed higher hematocrit and a tendency for higher free fatty
acids than juveniles. Right tympanic temperature was higher in adults than
juveniles. This result suggests a higher reaction metabolism in adults than
juveniles under a restraint stress. Due to the short-time of collecting the data,
plasmatic cortisol did not influence physiological parameters. Therefore, we
suggest that present results could be considered referential values of C.
penicillata physiology.

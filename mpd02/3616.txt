Hand preference in two adult C. jacchus (one male and one female) and five C.
penicillata (three adult females and two 70-day-old male and female infants) was 
examined in this study. Animals were housed in large wire mesh cages and daily
tested twice during 40 consecutive days in 15-minute experimental sessions. Tests
were carried out with dog food pellets and were as follows: 1) food taking from a
glass cylinder (12 cm long x 5 cm diameter), 2) food taking from an opaque
plastic flask (11 cm long x 9.5 cm diameter) behind wire mesh, 3) food taking
under the cage floor and 4) spontaneous activity (food manipulation,
self-grooming and scratching behavior, and grasping wire mesh). It was observed
that 1) subjects exhibit a high manual ability in all testing conditions, 2) hand
biases occurred, but the subjects either reversed hand preference or the
preference was ambiguous as the performances are examined in a longitudinal
perspective, 3) hand biases were clearly more visible in test 1, which may be due
to the complexity of this task itself, 4) hand biases were not similar in all
testing conditions--i.e., subjects were left--in one test and right-handed in
another-, and 5) the main results were very similar in both C. jacchus and C.
penicillata and seem to be not dependent on either sex or age.

Oculomotor areas involved in the parasympathetic control of accommodation and
pupil size in the marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).

Clarke RJ, Coimbra CJ, Alessio ML.

The motoneurons of the oculomotor complex responsible for controlling
accommodation and pupil size of the marmoset were identified by injecting
horseradish peroxidase (HRP) into the ciliary ganglion. The anatomical
organization of accommodation and pupil constrictor motoneurons was determined
using electrical stimulation techniques. HRP-labelled cells were found through
the whole length of the Edinger-Westphal nucleus (EW) and also just ventral to
this nucleus in caudal sections. A projection from the antero-median nucleus to
the ciliary ganglion could not be demonstrated. Electrical stimulation data
showed that currents of less than 1 microampere applied inside the EW evoked
accommodation responses. Pupil constriction responses, on the other hand, were
evoked with weak currents at sites ventral to those in the EW generating
accommodation at caudal and central levels. It was concluded that the EW was
responsible for accommodation and areas containing HRP-labelled cells ventral to 
the caudal part of the EW were responsible for pupil constriction.

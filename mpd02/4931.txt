Hyperthermia as a teratogenic agent.

Poswillo D, Nunnerley H, Sopher D, Keith J.

The common cotton-eared marmoset, a nonhuman primate with a narrow zone of
thermoneutrality, was used in an experiment to assess the effects of hyperthermia
as a teratogenic agent. Mild heat stress conditions were used. The results of
this preliminary study justify further investigation of the effect of
hyperthermia on the primate embryo during morphogenesis.

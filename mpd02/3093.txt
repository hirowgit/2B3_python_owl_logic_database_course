Non-human primates exhibit similar physiological and behavioral responses to
anxiety-inducing situations as humans and have, in fact, been successfully
employed in both conditioned (i.e. conflict paradigms) and ethologically based
tests of fear/anxiety (i.e. involuntary isolation, social interaction, human
threat, predator confrontation). In the last decade, a renewed and growing
interest in non-human primate models has resulted from the use of the small
callitrichid species in behavioral pharmacology and neuroscience. This review
focuses on the available non-human primate models for investigating fear/anxiety,
addressing their advantages, shortcomings, and conceptual framework on which they
are based. Lastly, a new ethologically based model to study anxiety and
fear-induced avoidance in callitrichids--the marmoset predator confrontation
test--is discussed.

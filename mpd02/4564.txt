Herpesvirus saimiri strain 11 immortalizes a restricted marmoset T8 lymphocyte
subpopulation in vitro.

Kiyotaki M, Desrosiers RC, Letvin NL.

Herpesvirus saimiri induces a fatal lymphoproliferative syndrome in a variety of 
New World primate species. We now show that cell lines derived from PBL of the
common marmoset by in vitro-immortalization with H. saimiri strain 11 represent a
remarkably restricted lymphocyte population. These cell lines have NK cell
function, phenotypically express both suppressor/cytotoxic (T8) and NK cell
(NKH1)-associated antigens, and express a T cell receptor. This subpopulation of 
lymphocytes is a very minor population of cells in the peripheral blood of common
marmosets (less than or equal to 3%). The specificity in the interaction between 
H. saimiri strain 11 and a subpopulation of common marmoset lymphocytes
represents an example of a restricted viral lymphotropism and may have important 
implications for the disease induced by this virus in New World monkeys.

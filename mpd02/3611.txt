The recent isolation of GB viruses A and B from GB agent infected tamarins and
their lack of involvement in human hepatitis has sparked interest in the origin
of these viruses. Several healthy non-human primate species have been shown to
harbour sequences 52-79% identical to the GBV-A 5' nontranslated region. In this 
paper we report the near genome length sequence of GBV-Amx 70047 and GBV-Atri
1122. These sequences support previous observations about the genomic
organization of GBV-A and provide insight into the genomic variability within
this virus genus. Although the GBV-A variant polyproteins possess many motifs
conserved between other members of the Flaviviridae, they do not encode a basic
core-like protein. Amino acid sequence comparisons and phylogenetic analysis
demonstrate variability within the GBV-A genus similar to that observed between
hepatitis C virus (HCV) types. However, genomic organization and disease
association demonstrate a closer evolutionary relationship to GBV-C than to HCV.

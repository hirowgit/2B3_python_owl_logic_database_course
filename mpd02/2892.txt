The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a small, nonendangered New World
primate that is native to Brazil and has been used extensively in biomedical
research. Historically the common marmoset has been used in neuroscience,
reproductive biology, infectious disease, and behavioral research. Recently, the 
species has been used increasingly in drug development and safety assessment.
Advantages relate to size, cost, husbandry, and biosafety issues as well as
unique physiologic differences that may be used in model development.
Availability and ease of breeding in captivity suggest that they may represent an
alternative species to more traditional nonhuman primates. The marmoset models
commonly used in biomedical research are presented, with emphasis on those that
may provide an alternative to traditional nonhuman primate species.

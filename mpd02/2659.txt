The recent discovery of an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-related lymphocryptovirus
(LCV) naturally infecting common marmosets demonstrated that gamma-1
herpesviruses are not limited to human and Old World nonhuman primate hosts. We
developed serologic assays to detect serum antibodies against lytic- and
latent-infection marmoset LCV antigens in order to perform the first
seroepidemiologic study of LCV infection in New World primates. In three
different domestic colonies and in animals recently captured from the wild, we
found that the seroprevalence of marmoset LCV infection was not as ubiquitous as 
with EBV or Old World LCV. These biologic differences in LCV infection of New
World versus human and Old World primate hosts correlate with the evolution of
the LCV viral gene repertoire.

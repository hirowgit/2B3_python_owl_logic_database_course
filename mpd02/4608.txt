Palatability and digestibility of soya- and milk proteins in Callithricidae.

Flurer C, Krombach F, Zucker H.

4 protein sources were tested for palatability, digestibility, influence on
bodyweight and consistency of faeces in Callithrix jacchus and Saguinus
fuscicollis. The protein sources were incorporated at crude protein levels of 12,
17 and 22% in a pelleted diet. A banana supplement was also fed which reduced the
total protein content to 10.7, 14.7 and 18.3%. The test diets, fed for 3 weeks,
were well accepted with the milk proteins being slightly preferred. Consumption
of the 12% protein pellets was greater than their 22% equivalents. True protein
digestibility was calculated to be 97% for lactalbumin, 96% for casein, 90% for
soy protein concentrate and 83% for soyabean meal. Changes in bodyweight were
negligible. Dry matter of faeces varied between 25% (lactalbumin diets) and 28%
(casein diets), but did not change with increasing protein intake. Increasing
levels of cellulose, from 2.4 to 7.2% total crude fibre lowered the apparent
protein digestibility from 84.3 to 79.2% and the digestibility of dry matter from
82.2 to 76.5%.

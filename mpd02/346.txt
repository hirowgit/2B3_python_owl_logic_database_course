BLIMP1 (PRDM1) and VASA (DDX4) play pivotal roles in the development of the germ 
cell linage. Importantly, these genes are specifically expressed in germ cells;
BLIMP1 in primordial germ cells (PGCs) to early-stage gonocytes, and VASA in
migration-stage PGCs to mature gametes. The high reproductive efficiency of
common marmosets (marmosets; Callithrix jacchus) makes them advantageous for use 
in germ cell research. We herein report the generation of a male marmoset
embryonic stem cell (ESC) line harboring BLIMP1 and DDX4 double reporters. This
ESC line will be a useful tool for investigating male gametogenesis in non-human 
primates.

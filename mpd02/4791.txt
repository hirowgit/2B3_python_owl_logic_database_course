Bone marrow, lymphoid, and peripheral blood cells from the common marmoset and
rhesus monkey have been tested with a panel of heterologous and monoclonal
antibodies, and their reactivity pattern has been compared with that of blood and
bone marrow cells from human donors. Conventional antibodies reveal extensive
cross-reactivity within the B cell, T cell, and granulocytic systems in all three
species, however, some important differences have been exposed. Only the
monoclonal antibodies to HLA-A,B,C and Ia-like antigens react with marmoset
cells, and we have exploited this finding to show that the vast majority of
colony-forming units (CFU-c) in the marmoset bone marrow (as in man) are Ia
positive. The use of the common marmoset as a suitable model for human bone
marrow transplantation is discussed in the light of these findings.

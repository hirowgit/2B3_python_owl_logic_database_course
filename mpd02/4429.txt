Marmosets were given either a hepatotoxin, carbon tetrachloride, orally or an
i.m. injection of a mytoxin, chlorpromazine. Although muscle damage alone caused 
small increases in the plasma levels of lactate dehydrogenase, alanine
aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase and isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH),
only the isoenzyme analysis of ICDH can differentiate definitely between liver
and muscle damage. Only very severe muscle damage can increase the plasma
concentration of this enzyme but, in this case, the elevation of plasma
creatinine kinase levels helps differentiation. It is recommended that the
elevation of ICDH is the most specific indicator of hepatic damage in the
marmoset.

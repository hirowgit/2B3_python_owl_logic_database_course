Blood pressure effects of renin inhibition by human renin antiserum in
normotensive marmosets.

The effects on blood pressure of an antiserum against pure human kidney renin
were studied in conscious and anesthetized (pentobarbital, 24 mg X kg-1 i.p.)
small new world monkeys (common marmosets). The antiserum inhibited the enzymatic
activity of renin by 50% in a dilution of 1:45,000 in marmoset and 1:50,000 in
human plasma. The antiserum (0.2 ml i.v.) decreased blood pressure in conscious
marmosets on normal sodium intake by 15 +/- 5 (SD) mmHg and after salt depletion 
by 31 +/- 13 mmHg. A converting enzyme inhibitor (teprotide, 2 mg X kg-1 i.v.)
induced a comparable fall in blood pressure: -16 +/- 10 and -30 +/- 10 mmHg,
respectively. Similar effects were observed on blood pressure of anesthetized
marmosets. The correlation between pretreatment plasma renin concentration and
the maximum fall in blood pressure was significant and identical for the
experiments with antiserum and teprotide. These results demonstrate that antisera
against human renin can be used for the specific blockade of the
renin-angiotensin system in primates. In normotensive marmosets the
renin-angiotensin system participates in the maintenance of blood pressure, to a 
degree depending on the state of sodium balance.

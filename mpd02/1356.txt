BACKGROUND: Nonhuman primates are important for both biomedical studies and
understanding human evolution. Although research in these areas has mostly
focused on Old World primates, such as the rhesus macaque, the common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus), a New World primate, offers important advantages in
comparison to other primates, such as an accelerated lifespan. To conduct Next
Generation expression studies or to study primate evolution, a high quality
annotation of the marmoset genome is required. The availability of marmoset
transcriptome data from five tissues, including both raw sequences and assembled 
transcripts, will aid in the annotation of the newly released marmoset assembly.
FINDINGS: RNA WAS EXTRACTED FROM FIVE TISSUES: skeletal muscle, bladder and
hippocampus from a male common marmoset, and cerebral cortex and cerebellum from 
a female common marmoset. All five RNA samples were sequenced on the Illumina
HiSeq 2000 platform. Sequences were deposited in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive. 
Transcripts were assembled, annotated and deposited in the NCBI Transcriptome
Shotgun Assembly database.
CONCLUSIONS: We have provided a high quality annotation of 51,163 transcripts
with full-length coding sequence. This set represented a total of 10,833 unique
genes. In addition to providing empirical support for the existence of these
10,833 genes, we also provide sequence information for 2,422 genes that were not 
previously identified in the Ensembl annotation of the marmoset genome.

Mixtures of Np, Pu and Am were administered to primates (C. jacchus) by gastric
intubation to measure their fractional gastrointestinal absorption (f1 values).
The values obtained were about 2 x 10(-3) and 1 x 10(-3), respectively, for Np
and Pu administered as the citrate, and 2 x 10(-3) and 6 x 10(-4), respectively, 
for Pu and Am in potato. The significance of these values in terms of absorption 
in humans is discussed.

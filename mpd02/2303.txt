This study was designed to characterize seizures induced with pentylenetetrazol
(PTZ) in marmosets. Thirteen adult marmosets (Callithrix sp.) received 20, 30, or
40 mg/kg of PTZ intraperitoneally. PTZ caused all animals to switch their natural
behavioral repertoire to early convulsive behavior. Seizure scores were low at
lower PTZ doses, whereas the highest dose of PTZ led to seizure scores IV and V
(according to Racine's scale) in 69% of animals. To further characterize the
model we performed a preliminary evaluation of the efficacy of three
antiepileptic drugs: phenobarbital, phenytoin, and carbamazepine. Phenobarbital
prevented PTZ-induced seizures in 100% of trials. As expected, phenytoin and
carbamazepine were not effective against PTZ-induced seizures. The present study 
describes the PTZ model of seizures in marmosets with a drug-response profile
similar to that of the rodent model, thus bringing to a well-known model (PTZ in 
rodents) the complexity of a nonhuman primate brain.

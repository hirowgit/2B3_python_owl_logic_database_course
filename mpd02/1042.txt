The main objective of this study was to evaluate sperm morphology in four
neotropical primate species to compare the sperm morphological traits and the
sperm morphometric parameters as a basis for establishing normative sperm
standards for each species. Data from 80 ejaculates collected from four primate
species, Callithrix jacchus, Callimico goeldii, Alouatta caraya and Ateles
geoffroyi, were analysed for detection of sperm morphological alterations using
subjective World Health Organization (WHO-2010) standards and Sperm Deformity
Index (SDI) criteria, objective computer-assisted sperm morphometry analysis
(CASMA) and subpopulation sperm determination (SSD) methods. There were multiple 
differences (p < 0.01) observed among primate species in values obtained from
WHO-2010, SDI, CASMA and SSD sperm analysis methods. In addition, multiple
significant positive and negative correlations were observed between the sperm
morphological traits (SDI, Sperm Deformity Index Head Defects, Sperm Deformity
Index Midpiece Defects, Sperm Deformity Index Tail Defects, Normal Sperm, Head
Defects, Midpiece Defects and Tail Defects) and the sperm morphometric parameters
(SSD, Area (A), Perimeter (P), Length (L), Width (W), Ellipticity, Elongation and
Rugosity) (p ≤ 0.046). In conclusion, our findings using different evaluation
methods indicate that pronounced sperm morphological variation exists among these
four neotropical primate species. Because of the strong relationship observed
among morphological and morphometric parameters, these results suggest that
application of objective analysis methods could substantially improve the
reliability of comparative studies and help to establish valid normative sperm
values for neotropical primates.

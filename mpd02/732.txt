Unlike visual signals, sound can reach the ears from any direction, and the
ability to localize sounds from all directions is essential for survival in a
natural environment. Previous studies have largely focused on the space in front 
of a subject that is also covered by vision and were often limited to measuring
spatial tuning along the horizontal (azimuth) plane. As a result, we know
relatively little about how the auditory cortex responds to sounds coming from
spatial locations outside the frontal space where visual information is
unavailable. By mapping single-neuron responses to the full spatial field in
awake marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), an arboreal animal for which spatial
processing is vital in its natural habitat, we show that spatial receptive fields
in several auditory areas cover all spatial locations. Several complementary
measures of spatial tuning showed that neurons were tuned to both frontal space
and rear space (outside the coverage of vision), as well as the space above and
below the horizontal plane. Together, these findings provide valuable new
insights into the representation of all spatial locations by primate auditory
cortex.

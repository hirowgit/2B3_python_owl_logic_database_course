HERV-H endogenous retroviruses are thought to be essential to stem cell identity 
in humans. We embrace several decades of HERV-H research in order to relate the
transcription of HERV-H loci to their genomic structure. We find that highly
transcribed HERV-H loci are younger, more fragmented, and less likely to be
present in other primate genomes. We also show that repeats in HERV-H LTRs are
correlated to where loci are transcribed: type-I LTRs associate with stem cells
while type-II repeats associate with embryonic cells. Our findings are generally 
in line with what is known about endogenous retrovirus biology but we find that
the presence of the zinc finger motif containing region of gag is positively
correlated with transcription. This leads us to suggest a possible explanation
for why an unusually large proportion of HERV-H loci have been preserved in
non-solo-LTR form.

The propagation of assembled α-synuclein (αS) is key to understanding the
pathological mechanisms of synucleinopathies such as Parkinson's disease,
dementia with Lewy bodies, and multiple system atrophy.Here we describe a
nonhuman primate model of αS propagation using common marmosets (Callithrix
jacchus) with an intracerebral injection of synthetic preformed αS fibrils. This 
protocol enables observation of the formation of phosphorylated αS pathology and 
its propagation three months after the injection.

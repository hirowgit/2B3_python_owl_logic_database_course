Whole metagenome shotgun (WMGS) sequencing is a method that provides insights
into the genomic composition and arrangement of complex microbial consortia.
Here, we report how WMGS coupled with a cultivation approach allows the isolation
of novel bifidobacteria from animal fecal samples. A combination of in silico
analyses based on nucleotide and protein sequences facilitate the identification 
of genetic material belonging to putative novel species. Consequently, the
prediction of metabolic properties by in silico analyses permits the
identification of specific substrates that are then employed to isolate these
species through a cultivation method.

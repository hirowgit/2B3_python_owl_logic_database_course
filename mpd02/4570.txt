A dose-response relationship was involved after an intravenous bolus of a human
antirenin monoclonal antibody (4G1D8), in sodium depleted marmosets. The sodium
depletion (furosemide: 30 mg/kg/d for 2 days) was used to potentiate the
contribution of the renin-angiotensin system in the blood pressure (BP) control. 
To record BP and inject the antibody, 2 catheters were implanted the day before
the experiment. The plasma renin activity (PRA) was measured by the RIA of
angiotensin I after an incubation of plasmas for 1 hour at pH 7.4. The sodium
depletion induced a dramatic increase of PRA (63.68 +/- 20.03 ng/ml/h of
angiotensin I compared to 2.96 +/- 1.03; p less than or equal to 0.01; n = 13).
The basal BP was 102.6 +/- 2.4 mmHg (n = 17). The maximal fall in BP was noted at
about 30 min for the three groups of animals treated by 4G1D8; it was -7.5 +/-
4.3 mmHg at the dose of 0.01 mg/kg (n = 4), -21.3 +/- 3.8 mmHg (p less than or
equal to 0.01) at 0.10 mg/kg (n = 4), and -27.5 +/- 1.4 mmHg (p = 0.10) at 0.24
mg/kg (n = 4). At the 0.10 and 0.24 mg/kg doses, the hypotension was lasting
(greater than 3 h). PRA was strongly inhibited and HR was little modified. A
dose-response relationship with a human antirenin monoclonal antibody, 4G1D8,
provides a very interesting pharmacological model for a comparative study of
renin inhibitors.

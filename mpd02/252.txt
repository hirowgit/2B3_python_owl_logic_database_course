Primates and rodents, which descended from a common ancestor around 90Â million
years ago1, exhibit profound differences in behaviour and cognitive capacity; the
cellular basis for these differences is unknown. Here we use single-nucleus RNA
sequencing to profile RNA expression in 188,776 individual interneurons across
homologous brain regions from three primates (human, macaque and marmoset), a
rodent (mouse) and a weasel (ferret). Homologous interneuron types-which were
readily identified by their RNA-expression patterns-varied in abundance and RNA
expression among ferrets, mice and primates, but varied less among primates. Only
a modest fraction of the genes identified as 'markers' of specific interneuron
subtypes in any one species had this property in another species. In the primate 
neocortex, dozens of genes showed spatial expression gradients among interneurons
of the same type, which suggests that regional variation in cortical contexts
shapes the RNA expression patterns of adult neocortical interneurons. We found
that an interneuron type that was previously associated with the mouse
hippocampus-the 'ivy cell', which has neurogliaform characteristics-has become
abundant across the neocortex of humans, macaques and marmosets but not mice or
ferrets. We also found a notable subcortical innovation: an abundant striatal
interneuron type in primates that had no molecularly homologous counterpart in
mice or ferrets. These interneurons expressed a unique combination of genes that 
encode transcription factors, receptors and neuropeptides and constituted around 
30% of striatal interneurons in marmosets and humans.

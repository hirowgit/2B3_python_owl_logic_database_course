The drug discovery activities for novel compounds with the superior efficacies to
current drugs have been largely unsuccessful in the psychiatric field. One of the
main reasons is the lack of appropriate behavioral assays and animal models for
psychiatric disorders. Since the prefrontal cortex has great roles in their
pathophysiology, non-human primate common marmosets with the well-developed
prefrontal cortex would be useful as experimental animals in the future
translational research. To measure objectively and quantitatively the psychiatric
symptoms like motivational deficits, negative affective bias and cognitive
impairments in patients with schizophrenia or major depressive disorder, the
clinical laboratory tasks have been developed. The development of marmoset
behavioral paradigms, which may correspond to the clinical laboratory tasks, have
been progressed for the translational research. On the other hand, there are
still limitations to develop the marmoset models resembling the pathophysiology
of psychiatric disorders. We review the current state and future perspective of
translational behavioral research using marmosets.

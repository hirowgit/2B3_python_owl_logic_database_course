BACKGROUND: Marmosets are susceptible to dengue virus (DENV) infection. However, 
blood parameter data and clinical signs of DENV-infected marmosets are limited.
METHODS: Blood hematological and serum biochemical values were obtained from
twelve DENV-inoculated and four mock-infected marmosets. Additionally, body
temperature and activity level were determined.
RESULTS: Five DENV-inoculated marmosets demonstrated thrombocytopenia, nine
demonstrated leucopenia, and five demonstrated an increase in the levels of AST, 
ALT, LDH, and BUN. Additionally, seven DENV-inoculated marmosets demonstrated
clinical signs including fever and decreases in activity. None of the four
mock-inoculated marmosets demonstrated changes in either hematological or
biochemical parameters.
CONCLUSIONS: Marmosets inoculated with DENV exhibited clinical signs and changes 
in hematological and biochemical parameters. The results suggest that blood
parameter data and clinical signs could potentially be useful markers for
understanding the progress of DENV infection in studies using marmosets.

Through enabling an efficient supply of cells and tissues in the health sector on
demand, cryopreservation is increasingly becoming one of the mainstream
technologies in rapid translation and commercialization of regenerative medicine 
research. Cryopreservation of tissue-engineered constructs (TECs) is an emerging 
trend that requires the development of practically competitive biobanking
technologies. In our previous studies, we demonstrated that conventional
slow-freezing using dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) does not provide sufficient
protection of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) frozen in 3D
collagen-hydroxyapatite scaffolds. After simple modifications to a
cryopreservation protocol, we report on significantly improved cryopreservation
of TECs. Porous 3D scaffolds were fabricated using freeze-drying of a mineralized
collagen suspension and following chemical crosslinking. Amnion-derived MSCs from
common marmoset monkey Callithrix jacchus were seeded onto scaffolds in static
conditions. Cell-seeded scaffolds were subjected to 24 h pre-treatment with
100 mM sucrose and slow freezing in 10% Me2SO/20% FBS alone or supplemented with 
300 mM sucrose. Scaffolds were frozen 'in air' and thawed using a two-step
procedure. Diverse analytical methods were used for the interpretation of
cryopreservation outcome for both cell-seeded and cell-free scaffolds. In both
groups, cells exhibited their typical shape and well-preserved cell-cell and
cell-matrix contacts after thawing. Moreover, viability test 24 h post-thaw
demonstrated that application of sucrose in the cryoprotective solution preserves
a significantly greater portion of sucrose-pretreated cells (more than 80%) in
comparison to Me2SO alone (60%). No differences in overall protein structure and 
porosity of frozen scaffolds were revealed whereas their compressive stress was
lower than in the control group. In conclusion, this approach holds promise for
the cryopreservation of 'ready-to-use' TECs.

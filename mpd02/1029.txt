BACKGROUND: Inhibition of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) has emerged as a
viable means to lengthen lifespan and healthspan in mice, although it is still
unclear whether these benefits will extend to other mammalian species. We
previously reported results from a pilot experiment wherein common marmosets
(Callithrix jacchus) were treated orally with rapamycin to reduce mTOR signaling 
in vivo in line with previous reports in mice and humans. Further, long-term
treatment did not significantly alter body weight, daily activity, blood lipid
concentrations, or glucose metabolism in this cohort.
METHODS: In this study, we report on the molecular consequences of rapamycin
treatment in marmosets on mechanisms that regulate protein homeostasis
(proteostasis) in vivo. There is growing appreciation for the role of
proteostasis in longevity and for the role that mTOR plays in regulating this
process. Tissue samples of liver and skeletal muscle from marmosets in our pilot 
cohort were assessed for expression and activity of components of the
ubiquitin-proteasome system, macroautophagy, and protein chaperones.
RESULTS: Rapamycin treatment was associated with increased expression of PSMB5, a
core subunit of the 20S proteasome, but not PSMB8 which is involved in the
formation of the immunoproteasome, in the skeletal muscle and liver.
Surprisingly, proteasome activity measured in these tissues was not affected by
rapamycin. Rapamycin treatment was associated with an increased expression of
mitochondria-targeted protein chaperones in skeletal muscle, but not liver.
Finally, autophagy was increased in skeletal muscle and adipose, but not liver,
from rapamycin-treated marmosets.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these data show tissue-specific upregulation of some, but
not all, components of the proteostasis network in common marmosets treated with 
a pharmaceutical inhibitor of mTOR.

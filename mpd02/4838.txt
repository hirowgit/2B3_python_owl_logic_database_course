The effects of gonadectomy and oestradiol-17 beta on pituitary responsiveness to 
LH-RH in the adult male marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).

Hodges JK.

Exogenous luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH) administered in a wide
range of doses (0.2-25 micrograms) to intact male marmoset monkeys induced a
marked increased in plasma luteinizing hormone (LH) concentrations. Maximum LH
concentrations achieved after injection of LH-RH occurred progressively later as 
the dosage increased. Bilateral orchidectomy sigificantly enhanced pituitary
responsiveness to a standard dose (2.0 microgram) of LH-RH, whereas the
introduction of oestradiol-17 beta implants effectively inhibited the responses. 
LH-RH-induced LH release after gonadectomy (with and without oestradiol-17 beta
treatment) was similar in males and females. The use of marmosets for appropriate
investigation into the physiological role of LH-RH in controlling LH secretion in
primates is proposed.

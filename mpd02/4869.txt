Threat, attack and flight elicited by electrical stimulation of the ventromedial 
hypothalamus of the marmoset monkey Callithrix jacchus.

Lipp HP, Hunsperger RW.

In order to elucidate whether relatively primitive primates show a similar
topological organization of substrates mediating defense and flight within the
ventromedial hypothalamus as has been found in other mammals, 15 marmosets
(Callithrix jacchus) were chronically implanted with a total of 57 electrodes for
electrical stimulation. Experiments took place in a familiar environment and
under systematically altered conditions. All anatomical sites yielding vocal
threat and short attacks were found to be situated in the n. ventromedialis.
Flight was elicited from a region immediately lateral to this nucleus and from
sites in the posterior hypothalamus. Thus, it appears that the topological
organization of defense and flight behavior in cat, oppossum and marmoset are
essentially similar.

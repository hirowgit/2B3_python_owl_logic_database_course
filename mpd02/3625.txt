Primate embryonic stem (ES) cells are derived from preimplantation embryos, have 
a normal karyotype, and are capable of indefinite, undifferentiated
proliferation. Even after culture for more than a year, primate ES cells maintain
the potential to differentiate to trophoblast and derivatives of embryonic
endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm. In this review, we compare the characteristics 
of ES cell lines from two primate species, the rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta) and
the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), with the characteristics of mouse ES
cells and human embryonal carcinoma cells. We also discuss the implications of
using primate ES cells to understand early human development and discuss the
practical and ethical implications for the understanding and treatment of human
disease.

The follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) beta-subunit cDNAs were cloned and
sequenced for an old world primate, the rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta), and two
New World primates, the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) and pygmy marmoset
(Cebuella pygmaea). The cDNA and predicted amino acid sequences of the rhesus
monkey FSH beta-subunit were related most closely to the human FSH beta-subunit
(> 96% identity). The common and pygmy marmosets have identical FSH beta-subunit 
cDNAs, whereas the marmoset FSH beta-subunit diverges from the rhesus and human
molecules with less than 93% identity. These results have significance for the
implementation of assisted reproductive technologies in the nonhuman primate as
well as the evolution of genes encoding reproductive hormones.

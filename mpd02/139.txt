Crithidia mellificae, a monoxenous trypanosomatid considered restricted to
insects, was recently reported to infect a bat. Herein, C. mellificae has been
demonstrated to have a wider range of vertebrate hosts and distribution in
Brazilian biomes than once thought. Parasites isolated from haemocultures were
characterized using V7V8 SSU rDNA and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase
genes. Coatis (Nasua nasua) in the Cerrado; marmosets (Callithrix sp.) and bats
(Carollia perspicillata, Myotis lavali, M. izecksohni, Artibeus lituratus) in the
Atlantic Forest; crab-eating foxes (Cerdocyon thous) and ocelot (Leopardus
pardalis) in the Pantanal biomes were infected by trypanosomatids that displayed 
choanomastigote forms in haemoculture in Giemsa-stained slide smears. Molecular
characterization and phylogenetic inference confirmed the infection of C.
mellificae in these animals. Moreover, slight differences in C. mellificae
sequences were observed. Crithidia mellificae growth curves were counted at 27°C,
36°C and 37°C, and the morphotypes were able to grow and survive for up to 16
days. Serological titers for C. mellificae were observed in nonhuman primates,
demonstrating that this parasite is able to induce a humoral immune response in
an infected mammal. These results showed that host specificity in trypanosomatids
is complex and far from understood.

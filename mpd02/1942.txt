Based on increasing knowledge on the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA),
more and more potential therapeutics have been developed. To evaluate their
therapeutic efficacy, safety and toxicity, appropriate animal models are
required. Although rodent models of RA have been extensively used for preclinical
evaluation, the differences between rodents and humans limit their usability for 
some species-specific therapeutics. Therefore, autoimmune arthritis developed in 
a non-human primate with essential hallmarks of RA will be an alternative model
for preclinical studies.

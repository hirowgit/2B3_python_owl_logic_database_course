An apparatus and a method are described, which allow simultaneous urine
collection from all individual members of undisturbed marmoset families. The
monkeys have been trained, after leaving their sleeping box, to enter single
adjacent compartments where they are rewarded. There the monkeys micturate within
minutes and the clean urine runs directly into cryotubes. These simultaneously
collected urine samples open up the opportunity for investigation of the
relationship between endocrine function and behavioral dynamics within entire
marmoset groups. © 1993 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

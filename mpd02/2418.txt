The capacity for non-linguistic, numerical discrimination has been well
characterized in non-human animals, with recent studies providing careful
controls for non-numerical confounds such as continuous extent, density, and
quantity. More poorly understood are the conditions under which animals use
numerical versus non-numerical quantification, and the nature of the relation
between these two systems. Here we test whether cotton-top tamarins and common
marmosets can discriminate between two quantities on the basis of the amount of
food rather than on number. In three experiments, we show that when choosing
between arrays containing different numbers and sizes of food objects, both
species based their decisions on the amount of food with only minor influences of
numerical information. Further, we find that subjects successfully discriminated 
between two quantities differing by a 2:3 or greater ratio, which is consistent
with the ratio limits found for numerical discrimination with this species. These
studies demonstrate that non-human primates possess mechanisms that enable
quantification of total amount, in addition to the numerical representations
demonstrated in previous studies, with both types of quantification subject to
similar processing limits.

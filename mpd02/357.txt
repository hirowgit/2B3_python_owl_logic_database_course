Background: Primary human hepatocytes (PHHs) are the ideal candidates for
studying critical liver functions such as drug metabolism and toxicity. However, 
as they are isolated from discarded livers that are unsuitable for
transplantation, they possess limited expansion ability in vitro and their
enzymatic functions deteriorate rapidly because they are often of poor quality.
Therefore, there is a compelling reason to find reliable alternative sources of
hepatocytes.
Methods: In this study, we report on efficient and robust differentiation of
embryonic stem cells (ESC) from the common marmoset Callithrix jacchus into
functional hepatocyte-like cells (HLC) using a simple, and reproducible
three-step procedure. ESC-derived HLCs were examined by morphological analysis
and tested for their expression of hepatocyte-specific markers using a
combination of immunohistochemistry, RT-PCR, and biochemical assays. Primary
human hepatocytes were used as controls.
Results: ESC-derived HLCs expressed each of the hepatocyte-specific markers
tested, including albumin; α-fetoprotein; asialoglycoprotein receptor 1; α-1
antitrypsin; hepatocyte nuclear factors 1α and 4; cytokeratin 18; hepatocyte
growth factor receptor; transferrin; tyrosine aminotransferase; alkaline
phosphatase; c-reactive protein; cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP1A2, CYP2E1 and
CYP3A4; and coagulation factors FVII and FIX. They were functionally competent as
demonstrated by biochemical assays in addition to producing urea.
Conclusion: Our data strongly suggest that marmoset HLCs possess characteristics 
similar to those of PHHs. They could, therefore, be invaluable for studies on
drug metabolism and cell transplantation therapy for a variety of liver
disorders. Because of the similarities in the anatomical and physiological
features of the common marmoset to that of humans, Callithrix jacchus is an
appropriate animal model to study human disease conditions and cellular
functions.

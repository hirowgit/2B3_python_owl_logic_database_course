Immunoreactivity for calcium-/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) in 
the primate dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) has been attributed to
geniculocortical relay neurons and has also been suggested to arise from
terminals of retinal ganglion cells. Here, we combined immunostaining with
single-cell injections to investigate the expression of CaMKII in retinal
ganglion cells of three primate species: macaque (Macaca fascicularis, M.
nemestrina), human, and marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). We found that in all
species, about 2%-10% of the total ganglion cell population expressed CaMKII. In 
all species, CaMKII was expressed by multiple types of wide-field ganglion cell
including large sparse, giant sparse (melanopsin-expressing), broad thorny, and
narrow thorny cells. Three other ganglion cells types, namely, inner and outer
stratifying maze cells in macaque and tufted cells in marmoset were also found.
Double labeling experiments showed that CaMKII-expressing cells included inner
and outer stratifying melanopsin cells. Nearly all CaMKII-expressing ganglion
cell types identified here are known to project to the koniocellular layers of
the dLGN as well as to the superior colliculus. The best characterized
koniocellular projecting cell type-the small bistratified (blue ON/yellow OFF)
cell-was, however, not CaMKII-positive in any species. Our results indicate that 
the pattern of CaMKII expression in retinal ganglion cells is largely conserved
across different species of primate suggesting a common functional role. But the 
results also show that CaMKII is not a marker for all koniocellular projecting
retinal ganglion cells.

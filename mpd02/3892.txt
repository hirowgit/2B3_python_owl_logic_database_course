The cellular and intracellular metabolization sites of the tissue hormone and
paracrine compound histamine as a source for the indirect and potentially toxic
or physiological mediator molecule H2O2 are not yet known. Therefore, in the
present study, histamine was used as the substrate in a
cerium-diaminobenzidine-H2O2-Co procedure to visualize for the first time the
oxidative deamination and H2O2-production sites of this amine in various
laboratory animals. Diamine oxidase (DAOX) was shown to be the responsible
enzyme. With the exception of marmosets, all species could deaminate histamine
oxidatively and form H2O2. In most species, H2O2 was produced by DAOX from
histamine in small intestinal enterocytes; in rats H2O2 was generated in all
vascular and non-vascular smooth muscle cells; in guinea-pigs only smooth muscle 
cells in the digestive tract and uterus and in addition the cardiac and gastric
capillary endothelium and hepatic sinusoidal endothelium produced H2O2.
Furthermore, in some species H2O2 was generated by DAOX with histamine as the
substrate in certain renal, adrenal and splenic cell types. While H2O2-production
in enterocytes may derive from luminal-borne histamine, i.e., from histamine of
foreign origin, the formation of H2O2 in the other cells suggests endogenous
(mast cell, basophilborne) histamine as the substrate and H2O2 source.

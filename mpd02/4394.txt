Acute treatment of common marmosets with
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) caused an initial profound
akinesia and other motor deficits. However, over the following months akinesia
gradually disappeared although the animals remained clumsy and poorly
coordinated. At 10 days following MPTP treatment there was a profound decrease in
the dopamine, HVA and DOPAC content of the caudate nucleus, putamen and nucleus
accumbens. By 3-4 months following MPTP treatment the animals had largely
recovered from their akinesia, but the caudate nucleus and putamen dopamine, HVA 
and DOPAC content remained low. In contrast, the dopamine content of the nucleus 
accumbens had returned towards normal and the metabolite levels were higher than 
at 10 days. No overall alterations in 5HT or 5HIAA levels were observed at either
time point. The transient and reversible nature of dopamine loss in the nucleus
accumbens may contribute to the initial profound akinesia exhibited by common
marmosets treated with MPTP. The restoration of dopamine levels in the nucleus
accumbens may be partially responsible for the subsequent recovery of motor
function that occurs in MPTP-treated marmosets.

Complete DNA sequences were determined for the glycoprotein B (gB) genes of four 
viruses from the genus Lymphocryptovirus, whose hosts had been assigned as
baboon, orangutan, chimpanzee and gorilla. Together with published sequences for 
the gB genes of three lymphocryptoviruses, namely the human pathogen Epstein-Barr
virus (EBV), a rhesus monkey virus and a marmoset virus, the sequences were used 
to investigate evolutionary relationships in the genus. The chimpanzee and
orangutan viruses' sequences were found to be so close that it is unlikely both
represent natural infections in these hosts. Phylogenetic analyses showed that
the New World marmoset virus lineage formed a sister clade to that of the Old
World viruses, consistent with a cospeciational separation. Within the Old World 
virus group, resolution of branching pattern was incomplete, and suggestive of a 
complex history. In particular, it was inferred that separation of the EBV
lineage from that of the gorilla virus plus the chimpanzee/orangutan virus may
have predated separation of the present day host species.

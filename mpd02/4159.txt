Viruses from passages 9/10, 21, and 32 of a serially passaged human isolate of
hepatitis A virus, strain HM-175, were partially sequenced and compared for their
abilities to grow in cell cultures and to cause disease in primates. Viruses from
all passages grew more efficiently in cell culture than did the wild-type
virulent virus from which they were derived, and all displayed some degree of
attenuation of virulence for primates. Within the 5' noncoding region and the
2B2C region of the HAV genome, passage 9/10 virus differed in sequence from
wild-type at a single and novel position in the 2C gene, while the sequence of
the passage 32 virus was almost identical to that of a fully attenuated passage
35 virus. Passage 21 viruses were found to consist of a mixture of viruses which 
included all but two of the 13 mutations present in the sequenced regions of the 
virus from passage 32.

Common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is an attractive animal model primate
species for potential use in drug metabolism and pharmacokinetic studies. In this
study, marmoset cytochrome P450 (P450) 2S1, 4V2, 7A1, 7B1, 8B1, 24A1, 26A1, 26C1,
27A1, 39A1, and 51A1 cDNAs were isolated from marmoset tissues (brains, lungs,
livers, kidneys, and jejunums). Deduced amino acid sequences (89-98% homologous) 
of the marmoset P450 gene suggested similarity of molecular characteristics of
marmoset P450s to human counterparts, compared with those of pig, rabbit, and
rodents. Phylogenetic analysis using amino acid sequences indicated 11 marmoset
P450 forms clustered with those of human and other primate counterparts,
suggesting marmoset P450s have an evolutionary close relationship to human and
other primate counterparts. Tissue expression patterns of these P450 mRNAs except
for P450 7B1 mRNA were generally similar to those of human P450s in the five
tissue types analyzed. These results suggest similarity of molecular
characteristics for P450 2S1, 4V2, 7A1, 7B1, 8B1, 24A1, 26A1, 26C1, 27A1, 39A1,
and 51A1 between marmosets and humans, in addition to the orthologs of human P450
1, 2, 3, and 4 families previously identified and characterized in marmosets.

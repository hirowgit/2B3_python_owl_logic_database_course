Precise spatiotemporal control of gene expression in the developing brain is
critical for neural circuit formation, and comprehensive expression mapping in
the developing primate brain is crucial to understand brain function in health
and disease. Here, we developed an unbiased, automated, large-scale,
cellular-resolution in situ hybridization (ISH)-based gene expression profiling
system (GePS) and companion analysis to reveal gene expression patterns in the
neonatal New World marmoset cortex, thalamus, and striatum that are distinct from
those in mice. Gene-ontology analysis of marmoset-specific genes revealed
associations with catalytic activity in the visual cortex and neuropsychiatric
disorders in the thalamus. Cortically expressed genes with clear area boundaries 
were used in a three-dimensional cortical surface mapping algorithm to delineate 
higher-order cortical areas not evident in two-dimensional ISH data. GePS
provides a powerful platform to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying
primate neurobiology and developmental psychiatric and neurological disorders.

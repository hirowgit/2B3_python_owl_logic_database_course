Immunocytochemical localization of neuropeptides (beta-endorphin, substance P,
arginine vasopressin, oxytocin), pituitary hormones (adrenocorticotropin,
prolactin, growth hormone, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), gonadal inhibin,
gastrin, and human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG)) was carried out in marmoset
testis during development. Both intensity of immunostaining and distribution of
these peptides in testicular compartments viz. seminiferous tubules and Leydig
cells changed dramatically during development. In vitro biosynthesis of inhibin
and FSH was increased by hCG, whereas prolactin (5 micrograms) and prostatic
inhibin peptide suppressed the synthesis of these hormones.

The mechanism of kidney injury in aging are not well understood. In order to
identify hitherto unknown pathways of aging-related kidney injury, we performed
RNA-Seq on kidney extracts of young and aged mice. Expression of chloride (Cl)
channel accessory 1 (CLCA1) mRNA and protein was increased in the kidneys of aged
mice. Immunostaining showed a marked increase in CLCLA1 expression in the
proximal tubules of the kidney from aged mice. Increased kidney CLCA1 gene
expression also correlated with aging in marmosets and in a human cohort. In
aging mice, increased renal cortical CLCA1 content was associated with hydrogen
sulfide (H2 S) deficiency, which was ameliorated by administering sodium
hydrosulfide (NaHS), a source of H2 S. In order to study whether increased CLCA1 
expression leads to injury phenotype and the mechanisms involved, stable
transfection of proximal tubule epithelial cells overexpressing human CLCA1
(hCLCA1) was performed. Overexpression of hCLCA1 augmented Cl- current via the
Ca++ -dependent Cl- channel TMEM16A (anoctamin-1) by patch-clamp studies. hCLCA1 
overexpression also increased the expression of fibronectin, a matrix protein,
and induced the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Mechanistic
studies underlying these changes showed that hCLCA1 overexpression leads to
inhibition of AMPK activity and stimulation of mTORC1 as cellular signaling
determinants of injury. Both TMEM16A inhibitor and NaHS reversed these signaling 
events and prevented changes in fibronectin and SASP. We conclude that
CLCA1-TMEM16A-Cl- current pathway is a novel mediator of kidney injury in aging
that is regulated by endogenous H2 S.

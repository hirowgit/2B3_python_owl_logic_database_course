This report describes the activity budget of a group of Callithrix geoffroyi in a
patch of Atlantic forest on the Brazilian coast, between February 1993 and
January 1994, using the scan sampling methods. On average, the group rested for
29% of the daylight hours, fed for 21%, moved for 20%, and foraging and gouging
occupied 14% and 13% of this period, respectively. A greater proportion of time
was spent resting during the wet seasons (32.1%) than the dry seasons (17.8%),
but the reverse observed for time spent foraging (9.7% and 20.6% of the group's
daylight hours during wet and dry seasons, respectively). The time allocated to
feeding was greater in the first hours of the day. Gum consumption showed two
peaks, a larger one in the early morning and a minor one in the afternoon. Animal
prey foraging occurred throughout the day, but was more intense during the
hottest hours. The increase in foraging and decrease in resting during the dry
season was related to a decrease in the availability of insects.

In most species, the zona pellucida (ZP), an extracellular matrix surrounding the
mammalian oocyte, is composed of three glycoproteins: ZPA, ZPB and ZPC. Based
mainly on results with mice, the site of zona pellucida biosynthesis has been
suggested to be exclusively in the oocyte cytoplasm. However, evidence is
accumulating that among various species cumulus/granulosa cells may be involved. 
Because knowledge of ZP biosynthesis in primates is lacking, we used the common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) to acquire information about the localization and
the site of synthesis of ZP proteins in this species. Using antibodies against
synthetic ZPA and ZPC peptides, immunoreactivity was found in the marmoset ZP and
in surrounding cumulus cells. Interestingly, the amounts of ZPA and ZPC proteins 
expressed appeared to differ depending on the stage of folliculogenesis. RT-PCR
analysis of mRNA from marmoset oocytes and from oocyte-free follicle cells
revealed expression of ZPA, ZPB and ZPC in oocytes and in follicle cells of
different stages of marmoset monkey folliculogenesis. Our data suggest that the
biosynthesis of marmoset ZPA, ZPB and ZPC proteins takes place both in oocytes
and in follicle cells of different follicle stages, although the abundance of ZP 
glycoproteins may differ depending on the individual ZP protein.

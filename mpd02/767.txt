The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a New-World monkey of growing
interest in neuroscience. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an essential tool
to unveil the anatomical and functional organization of the marmoset brain. To
facilitate identification of regions of interest, it is desirable to register MR 
images to an atlas of the brain. However, currently available atlases of the
marmoset brain are mainly based on 2D histological data, which are difficult to
apply to 3D imaging techniques. Here, we constructed a 3D digital atlas based on 
high-resolution ex-vivo MRI images, including magnetization transfer ratio (a
T1-like contrast), T2w images, and multi-shell diffusion MRI. Based on the
multi-modal MRI images, we manually delineated 54 cortical areas and 16
subcortical regions on one hemisphere of the brain (the core version). The 54
cortical areas were merged into 13 larger cortical regions according to their
locations to yield a coarse version of the atlas, and also parcellated into 106
sub-regions using a connectivity-based parcellation method to produce a refined
atlas. Finally, we compared the new atlas set with existing histology atlases and
demonstrated its applications in connectome studies, and in resting state and
stimulus-based fMRI. The atlas set has been integrated into the
widely-distributed neuroimaging data analysis software AFNI and SUMA, providing a
readily usable multi-modal template space with multi-level anatomical labels
(including labels from the Paxinos atlas) that can facilitate various
neuroimaging studies of marmosets.

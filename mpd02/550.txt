STUDY QUESTION: Can full spermatogenesis be achieved after xenotransplantation of
prepubertal primate testis tissue to the mouse, in testis or subcutaneously?
SUMMARY ANSWER: Intratesticular xenotransplantation supported the differentiation
of immature germ cells from marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) into spermatids and
spermatozoa at 4 and 9 months post-transplantation, while in subcutaneous
transplants, spermatogenic arrest was observed at 4 months and none of the
transplants survived at 9 months.
WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Auto-transplantation of cryopreserved immature testis
tissue (ITT) could be a potential fertility restoration strategy for patients
with complete loss of germ cells due to chemo- and/or radiotherapy at a young
age. Before ITT transplantation can be used for clinical application, it is a
prerequisite to demonstrate the feasibility of the technique and identify the
conditions required for establishing spermatogenesis in primate ITT transplants. 
Although xenotransplantation of ITT from several species has resulted in complete
spermatogenesis, in human and marmoset, ITT has not been successful.
STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: In this study, we used marmoset as a pre-clinical
animal model. ITT was obtained from two 6-month-old co-twin marmosets. A total of
147 testis tissue pieces (~0.8-1.0 mm3 each) were transplanted into the
testicular parenchyma (intratesticular; n = 40) or under the dorsal skin
(ectopic; n = 107) of 4-week-old immunodeficient Swiss Nu/Nu mice (n = 20). Each 
mouse received one single marmoset testis tissue piece in each testis and 4-6
pieces subcutaneously. Xenotransplants were retrieved at 4 and 9 months
post-transplantation and evaluations were performed with regards to transplant
survival, spermatogonial quantity and germ cell differentiation.
PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Transplant survival was histologically 
evaluated by haematoxylin-periodic acid Schiff (H/PAS) staining. Spermatogonia
were identified by MAGE-A4 via immunohistochemistry. Germ cell differentiation
was assessed by morphological identification of different germ cell types on
H/PAS stained sections. Meiotically active germ cells were identified by BOLL
expression. CREM immunohistochemistry was performed to confirm the presence of
post-meiotic germ cells and ACROSIN was used to determine the presence of round, 
elongating and elongated spermatids.
MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Four months post-transplantation, 50% of the
intratesticular transplants and 21% of the ectopic transplants were recovered (P 
= 0.019). The number of spermatogonia per tubule did not show any variation. In
33% of the recovered intratesticular transplants, complete spermatogenesis was
established. Overall, 78% of the intratesticular transplants showed post-meiotic 
differentiation (round spermatids, elongating/elongated spermatids and
spermatozoa). However, during the same period, spermatocytes (early meiotic germ 
cells) were the most advanced germ cell type present in the ectopic transplants. 
Nine months post-transplantation, 50% of the intratesticular transplants
survived, whilst none of the ectopic transplants was recovered (P < 0.0001).
Transplants contained more spermatogonia per tubule (P = 0.018) than at 4 months.
Complete spermatogenesis was observed in all recovered transplants (100%),
indicating a progressive spermatogenic development in intratesticular transplants
between the two time-points. Nine months post-transplantation, transplants
contained more seminiferous tubules with post-meiotic germ cells (37 vs. 5%; P < 
0.001) and fewer tubules without germ cells (2 vs. 8%; P = 0.014) compared to 4
months post-transplantation.
LARGE SCALE DATA: N/A.
LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Although xenotransplantation of marmoset ITT
was successful, it does not fully reflect all aspects of a future clinical
setting. Furthermore, due to ethical restrictions, we were not able to prove the 
functionality of the spermatozoa produced in the marmoset transplants.
WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: In this pre-clinical study, we demonstrated
that testicular parenchyma provides the required microenvironment for germ cell
differentiation and long-term survival of immature marmoset testis tissue, likely
due to the favourable temperature regulation, growth factors and hormonal
support. These results encourage the design of new experiments on human ITT
xenotransplantation and show that intratesticular transplantation is likely to be
superior to ectopic transplantation for fertility restoration following
gonadotoxic treatment in childhood.

We review behavioural and neural evidence for the processing of information
contained in conspecific vocalizations (CVs) in three primate species: humans,
macaques and marmosets. We focus on abilities that are present and ecologically
relevant in all three species: the detection and sensitivity to CVs; and the
processing of identity cues in CVs. Current evidence, although fragmentary,
supports the notion of a "voice patch system" in the primate brain analogous to
the face patch system of visual cortex: a series of discrete, interconnected
cortical areas supporting increasingly abstract representations of the vocal
input. A central question concerns the degree to which the voice patch system is 
conserved in evolution. We outline challenges that arise and suggesting potential
avenues for comparing the organization of the voice patch system across primate
brains.

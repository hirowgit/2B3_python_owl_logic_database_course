Olfactory cues can elicit intense emotional responses. This study used fMRI in
male common marmoset monkeys to identify brain areas associated with sexual
arousal in response to odors of ovulating female monkeys. Under light anesthesia,
monkeys were secured in a specially designed restrainer and positioned in a 9.4 T
magnetic resonance spectrometer. When fully conscious, they were presented with
the scents of both ovariectomized and ovulating monkeys. The sexually arousing
odors of the ovulating monkeys enhanced signal intensity in the preoptic area and
anterior hypothalamus compared to the odors of ovariectomized monkeys. These data
corroborate previous findings in monkeys based on invasive electrical lesion and 
stimulation techniques and demonstrate the feasibility of using non-invasive
functional imaging on fully conscious common marmosets to study cue-elicited
emotional responses.

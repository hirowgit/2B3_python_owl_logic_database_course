Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells) are important for the future
development of regenerative medicine involving autologous cell therapy. Before
autologous cell therapy can be applied to human patients, suitable animal models 
must be developed, and in this context non-human primate models are critical. We 
previously characterized several lines of marmoset iPS cells derived from newborn
skin fibroblasts. In the present studies, we explored methods for the directed
differentiation of marmoset iPS cells in the neuroectodermal lineage. In this
process we used an iterative process in which combinations of small molecules and
protein factors were tested for their effects on mRNA levels of genes that are
markers for the neuroectodermal lineage. This iterative process identified
combinations of chemicals/factors that substantially improved the degree of
marker gene expression over the initially tested combinations. This approach
should be generally valuable in the directed differentiation of pluripotent cells
for experimental cell therapy.

Periodontal changes in distant teeth due to trauma from occlusion.

Nascimento A, Sallum AW.

The present investigation studies the changes that occur in periodontal
supporting tissues of lower canine and premolar of marmosets (Callithrix
jacchus), due to experimental modification of occlusal relationships in the
region of the molar. For our purposes an extracoronal arch wire of 0.7 mm
diameter was fixed into occlusal perforations of the upper third premolar and
first molar, on both sides. Eight male marmosets weighing from 250 to 350 grams
were used. After each experimental time interval of 7, 14, 21 and 28 days two
animals were sacrificed. The results clearly showed areas of tension with stretch
periodontal fibers in the distal region of the canine and areas of pressue with
osseous and redicular resorption in the mesial region of the first premolar. The 
tissue changes may be considered to result from transmission of abnormal forces
through the proximal contacts of teeth associated with displacements and minor
modifications in their occlusal relationships. Similar changes may occur in a
tooth distant from the teeth exposed to primary excessive occlusal forces.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common cause for sustained disability in
young adults, yet treatment options remain very limited. Although numerous
therapeutic approaches have been effective in rodent models of experimental
autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), only few proved to be beneficial in patients 
with MS. Hence, there is a strong need for more predictive animal models. Within 
the past decade, EAE in the common marmoset evolved as a potent, alternative
model for MS, with immunological and pathological features resembling more
closely the human disease. However, an often very rapid and severe disease course
hampers its implementation for systematic testing of new treatment strategies. We
here developed a new focal model of EAE in the common marmoset, induced by myelin
oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) immunization and stereotactic injections of
proinflammatory cytokines. At the injection site of cytokines, confluent
inflammatory demyelinating lesions developed that strongly resembled human MS
lesions. In a proof-of-principle treatment study with the immunomodulatory
compound laquinimod, we demonstrate that targeted EAE in marmosets provides a
promising and valid tool for preclinical experimental treatment trials in MS
research.

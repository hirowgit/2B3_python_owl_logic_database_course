We report a case of tularemia in a common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) diagnosed
by determination of the isolate's 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequence.
Pathological examination of the animal revealed a multifocal acute necrotizing
hepatitis, interstitial nephritis, splenitis, and lymphangitis of the mandibular,
retropharyngeal, and cervical and mesenteric lymph nodes. Moreover, multiple foci
of acute necrosis were found in the epithelium of the jejunum and the
interstitium of the lung. Bacteriological investigations revealed a septicemia.
The isolated infectious agent was uncommon, not routinely diagnosed in our
laboratory and therefore difficult to identify by conventional tools in a
reasonable time and effort. thus, we decided to perform a genetic analysis based 
on the 16S rRNA gene sequence. Thereby, an infection with Francisella tularensis,
the causative agent of tularemia, was unambiguously diagnosed. This shows the
great advantage 16S rRNA gene sequencing has as a general identification approach
for unusual or rare isolates.

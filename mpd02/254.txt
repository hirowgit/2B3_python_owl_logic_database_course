In humans and macaque monkeys, socially relevant face processing is accomplished 
via a distributed functional network that includes specialized patches in frontal
cortex. It is unclear whether a similar network exists in New World primates, who
diverged ~35 million years from Old World primates. The common marmoset is a New 
World primate species ideally placed to address this question given their complex
social repertoire. Here, we demonstrate the existence of a putative high-level
face processing network in marmosets. Like Old World primates, marmosets show
differential activation in anterior cingulate and lateral prefrontal cortices
while they view socially relevant videos of marmoset faces. We corroborate the
locations of these frontal regions by demonstrating functional and structural
connectivity between these regions and temporal lobe face patches. Given the
evolutionary separation between macaques and marmosets, our results suggest this 
frontal network specialized for social face processing predates the separation
between Platyrrhini and Catarrhini.

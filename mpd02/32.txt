Genetic intervention is increasingly being explored as a therapeutic option for
debilitating disorders of the central nervous system. The safety and efficacy of 
gene therapies rely upon expressing a transgene in affected cells while
minimizing off-target expression. Here we show organ-specific targeting of
adeno-associated virus (AAV) capsids after intravenous delivery, which we
achieved by employing a Cre-transgenic-based screening platform and sequential
engineering of AAV-PHP.eB between the surface-exposed AA452 and AA460 of VP3.
From this selection, we identified capsid variants that were enriched in the
brain and targeted away from the liver in C57BL/6J mice. This tropism extends to 
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), enabling robust, non-invasive gene delivery to the
marmoset brain after intravenous administration. Notably, the capsids identified 
result in distinct transgene expression profiles within the brain, with one
exhibiting high specificity to neurons. The ability to cross the blood-brain
barrier with neuronal specificity in rodents and non-human primates enables new
avenues for basic research and therapeutic possibilities unattainable with
naturally occurring serotypes.

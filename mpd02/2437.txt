The synthesis of a series of
4-(6,7-dimethoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-2-yl)methyl-2-arylbenzofuran and
4-(6,7-dimethoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-2-yl)methylbenzofuran-2-carboxamid
e derivatives as novel alpha(2C)-adrenergic receptor antagonists are described.
Their affinity at three different human alpha(2)-adrenergic receptors is
reported, and some of these compounds exhibited high affinity for the
alpha(2C)-adrenergic receptor with high subtype selectivity. Among them, compound
10e has been found to show the anti-L-dopa-induced dyskinetic activity in
marmosets. The structure-activity relationship of these compounds is also
discussed.

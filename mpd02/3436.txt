Nitric oxide (NO), a mediator of biological functions, has an antimicrobial
activity against a variety of pathogens including viruses. In this study, we
found that a constitutive, low level of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) mRNA was
expressed in the EBV-infected gastric tissue-derived GT38 and GT39 cell lines, by
analysis with the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and
Southern blotting. Treatment of these cells with a specific NOS inhibitor,
NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA), induced the immediate-early, EBV
transactivator gene BZLF1 protein ZEBRA, suggesting a significant increase in EBV
reactivation by L-NMMA. Northern blotting demonstrated that BZLF1 and BRLF1
transcripts were also induced by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13 acetate (TPA).
Meanwhile, constitutive expression of iNOS mRNA was inhibited by TPA. L-NMMA also
enhanced TPA-induced expression of the BZLF1 gene. On the other hand, a NO donor,
S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP), which releases NO in an aqueous solution,
inhibited the TPA-induced BZLF1 gene expression in a dose-dependent manner at
both mRNA and protein levels. These results demonstrated that NO is a regulatory 
factor in maintaining virus latency via inhibiting EBV reactivation in the
infected epithelial cells.

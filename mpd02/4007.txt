The c-myc gene encodes a nuclear protein whose precise function is still not
fully understood. Introduction of a c-myc gene into a number of cell lines leads 
to an increase in their susceptibility to NK-cell lysis. It was reported earlier 
that c-myc can induce a decrease in the membrane expression of the MHC class-I
molecules and this may be one of the factors that render target cells relatively 
more susceptible to NK lysis. In this contribution, we show, in a human LCL line 
transfected with a constitutively active c-myc gene, an increased sensitivity to 
NK lysis, which correlates with an augmented effector-target binding ability of
c-myc-transfected LCLs and with a high ICAM-I expression rather than with
down-regulation of MHC class-I W6/32 epitope expression.

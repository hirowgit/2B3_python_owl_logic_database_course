Degeneration of dopaminergic nigrostriatal neurons in Parkinson's disease results
in an overactivity of excitatory glutamatergic projections from the subthalamic
nucleus to the output nuclei of the basal ganglia resulting in rigidity and
akinesia. In theory pharmacological blockade of these overactive systems should
improve parkinsonian symptomatology. The selective AMPA-antagonist NBQX and the
competitive NMDA-antagonist CPP are not effective in animal models of Parkinson's
disease when given alone but ameliorate parkinsonian symptomatology and stimulate
locomotor activity when co-administered with a threshold dose of L-Dopa. These
synergistic effects are seen in the MPTP-treated
(1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) common marmoset and the rat with
unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesions of the substantia nigra. Therefore 
competitive NMDA and non-NMDA antagonists may offer a new therapeutic strategy
for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.

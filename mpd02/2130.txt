Much of what is known about how the cochlear nuclei participate in mammalian
hearing comes from studies of non-primate mammalian species. To determine to what
extent the cochlear nuclei of primates resemble those of other mammalian orders, 
we have recorded responses to sound in three primate species: marmosets,
cynomolgus macaques, and squirrel monkeys. These recordings show that the same
types of temporal firing patterns are found in primates that have been described 
in other mammals. Responses to tones of neurons in the ventral cochlear nucleus
have similar tuning, latencies, post-stimulus time and interspike interval
histograms as those recorded in non-primate cochlear nucleus neurons. In the
dorsal cochlear nucleus, too, responses were similar. From these results it is
evident that insights gained from non-primate studies can be applied to the
peripheral auditory system of primates.

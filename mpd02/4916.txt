The use of transabdominal palpation to determine the course of pregnancy in the
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).

Phillips IR, Grist SM.

Transabdominal palpation was used to determine maturity, course of pregnancy and 
post-partum changes in marmosets throughout seventy-four full-term pregnancies.
The accuracy of the technique is compared with that of other methods of studying 
the course of pregnancy in this species.

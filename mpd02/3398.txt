The assembly assay for peptide binding to class I major histocompatibility
complex (MHC) molecules is based on the ability of peptides to stabilize MHC
class I molecules synthesized by transporter associated with antigen processing
(TAP)-deficient cell. The TAP-deficient cell line T2 has previously been used in 
the assembly assay to analyze peptide binding to HLA-A*0201 and -B*5101. In this 
study, we have extended this technique to assay for peptides binding to
endogenous HLA-Cw*0102 molecules. We have analyzed the peptide binding of 20
peptides with primary anchor motifs for HLA-Cw*0102. One-third of the peptides
analyzed bound with high affinity, half of the peptides examined did not bind,
whereas the remaining peptides displayed intermediate binding activity. Interest 
in HLA-C molecules has increased significantly in recent years, since it has been
shown that HLA-C molecules both can present peptides to cytotoxic T lymphocytes
(CTL) and in addition are able to inhibit natural killer (NK)-mediated lysis.

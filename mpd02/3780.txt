Cortical population coding could in principle rely on either the mean rate of
neuronal action potentials, or the relative timing of action potentials, or both.
When a single sensory stimulus drives many neurons to fire at elevated rates, the
spikes of these neurons become tightly synchronized, which could be involved in
'binding' together individual firing-rate feature representations into a unified 
object percept. Here we demonstrate that the relative timing of cortical action
potentials can signal stimulus features themselves, a function even more basic
than feature grouping. Populations of neurons in the primary auditory cortex can 
coordinate the relative timing of their action potentials such that spikes occur 
closer together in time during continuous stimuli. In this way cortical neurons
can signal stimuli even when their firing rates do not change. Population coding 
based on relative spike timing can systemically signal stimulus features, it is
topographically mapped, and it follows the stimulus time course even where mean
firing rate does not.

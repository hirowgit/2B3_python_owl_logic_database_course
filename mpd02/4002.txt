The growth transformation of human B cells by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is
controlled by the coordinate expression of 10 latent viral genes. This
transforming capacity is believed to be fundamental to the involvement of the
virus in human malignancies of B cell origin. EBV-negative Burkitt's lymphoma
(dG75) clones stably expressing one of these EBV-coded antigens, EBNA-4, have
been established using an episomal-based plasmid. EBNA-4 expression was found to 
upregulate the cytoskeletal protein vimentin as well as surface expression of the
activation antigen CD40. In addition, the presence of EBNA-4 resulted in
downregulation of the Burkitt's lymphoma-associated antigen (BLA/CD77). These
studies show for the first time that EBNA-4 modulates the expression of several
cellular genes implicated in cell-growth transformation.

L-3, 4-Dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-dopa) has been widely used for the treatment of 
Parkinson's disease (PD), but its pharmacokinetics in the striatum have hardly
been investigated, especially in primates. In this study, we examined the
concentration of L-dopa in plasma and in the extracellular fluid (ECF) of the
striatum in common marmosets using microdialysis and high-performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) with electrochemical detection. With a clinically
therapeutic dosage of L-dopa/benserazide (20/5 mg/kg, p.o.), the t(max) of L-dopa
was 30 min in plasma and 60-90 min in ECF of striatum. Mean C(max) was 20.3
microM in plasma and 442.9 nM in ECF of striatum, which is about 2.2% of that in 
plasma. The L-dopa concentration in ECF is much lower than those previously
applied during in vivo studies for L-dopa toxicity.

The involvement of parents and siblings in infant care in similarly composed
groups of common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) and cotton-top tamarins (Saguinus
oedipus) was compared during the infants' first 8 weeks of life. The results
indicate an earlier infant independence in C. jacchus than in S. oedipus due
primarily to a more frequent rejection of carried infants in C. jacchus. There
was no species difference in extent of maternal involvment in carrying infants.
However, S. oedipus fathers carried infants significantly more often during weeks
5-8 than did C. jacchus fathers. Siblings were generally more involved in infant 
care at an earlier infant age in C. jacchus than in S. oedipus.

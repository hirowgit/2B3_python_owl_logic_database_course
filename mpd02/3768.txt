transcriptase.

All primates studied to date produce retroviral-like particles in their
placentae. We have purified these particles from two primate species, one Old
World (human) and one New World (marmoset), and have identified the retroviral
sequences which are packaged into these particles. Three families of sequences
have been detected in these particles in human, all of which have the highest
homology to B- and D-type retroviruses and to the human endogenous retrovirus
HERV-K10. Previous studies have reported that the New World monkeys do not
possess sequences with homology to HERV-K10. We have identified a new family of
low-copy-number sequences which are present in New World monkeys and which
possess 70% homology to the HERV-K family. Particles from both species possess
reverse transcriptase activity and we have found that some of these retroviral
particles package sequences which encode long open reading frames in pol, as
revealed by expression cloning in Escherichia coli. These open reading frames
could encode the reverse transcriptase enzyme activity found in the particles.

Bacteria of the genus Ehrlichia are Gram-negative and coccoid-shaped
microorganisms that cause ehrlichiosis - a serious infectious disease that often 
leads to death. These bacteria present a strong zoonotic potential and primates
may act as reservoir hosts. This study involved a molecular analysis to detect
these microorganisms in blood samples collected from nineteen primates of the
genus Callithrix living free in an Atlantic Forest fragment in the municipality
of Viçosa, state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. One of the 19 primates was found to be 
infected with Ehrlichia canis. This finding points to a new wild host of E. canis
with a strong potential for transmission to humans because of its increasing
contact with people. This is the first report of Ehrlichia spp. in primate of the
genus Callithrix.

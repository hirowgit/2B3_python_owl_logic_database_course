Gustatory responses of the common marmoset were studied using single fiber
recordings from chorda tympani (CT) nerve and two bottle preference (TBP) tests. 
Hierarchical cluster analysis of 43 fibers' response profiles revealed 3 major
clusters of fibers characterized by predominant sensitivity to sweeteners (S
cluster), bitter compounds (Q cluster) or acids (H cluster). NaCl as well as LiCl
did not stimulate CT taste fibers. The TBP tests showed relationship between a
compound's ability to stimulate the taste fibers and the animals' consumption.
Activity in the S cluster was associated with preference, while the activity in
the Q cluster was associated with rejection. Marmosets neither preferred nor
rejected sweeteners which did not stimulate any CT fibers.

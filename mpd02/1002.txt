At least one non-human primate species-the marmoset monkey-exhibits developmental
processes similar to human vocal development. These processes include
babbling-like early vocal output and a role for social feedback in changing this 
output into mature-sounding vocalizations. Such parallel behaviors provide a
window through which we can begin to understand the physiological mechanisms for 
how early vocalizations are produced and shaped by social feedback. The latest
work shows that the acoustic structure of babbling in infant monkeys is driven by
oscillations of the autonomic nervous system. It is hypothesized that this
autonomic nervous system rhythm is perturbed through vocal interactions between
infants and parents. These interactions gradually accelerate the transformation
of immature vocalizations into mature forms.

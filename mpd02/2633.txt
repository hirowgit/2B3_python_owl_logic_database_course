The long-term sequelae of exposure to low doses of organophosphate compounds are 
ill defined, with effects variously reported on a range of indices of central
nervous system functions such as sleep, cognitive performance and
electroencephalogram (EEG). These indices were examined in common marmosets
exposed to a range of doses of the organophosphorous sheep dip, diazinon.
Cognitive performance was assessed by means of elements from the Cambridge
Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB), and radiotelemetry techniques
were employed to monitor the electrocorticogram and sleep patterns. Data were
collected for 12 months following intramuscular administration of a single dose
of diazinon (10, 90 or 130 mg.kg (-1)) or vehicle. Although high levels of
erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition (up to 82%) and short-term
changes in sleep patterns were seen, there was no evidence of biologically
significant long-term changes in any measures. The effects of multiple exposures,
impurities or mixtures of OP compounds remain to be investigated.

Better appreciation of the female reproductive anatomy of the common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus) should improve the prospects for nonsurgical embryo transfer
in this model. Vaginal measurements were performed in 8 female adult marmoset
monkeys. Four monkeys were measured at laparotomy for gross internal anatomy, and
1 monkey was analysed at autopsy. The vagina of the marmoset monkey was found to 
be divided into a lower and upper vagina with a marked vaginal isthmus between
them. The mean lengths of the lower and upper vagina were 17 mm (34 mm in total
vagina). The mean uterine size was 8.4 (length) x 10.0 (width) x 6.4 (thickness) 
mm, with the ovary measuring 5.3 x 4.3 x 3.8 mm. The mean length of the fallopian
tube was 10.5 mm with a width of 1.5 mm. Nonsurgical embryo transfer in this
model appears to be feasible, but the proportionally long vagina and short
uterine cavity needs to be recognised.

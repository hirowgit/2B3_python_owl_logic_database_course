Here we describe a new non-human primate model of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) to
better investigate the cause/effect relationships of human TLE. Status
epilepticus (SE) was induced in adult marmosets by pilocarpine injection
(250mg/kg; i.p.). The animals were divided in 2 groups: acute (8h post-SE) and
chronic (3 and 5 months post-SE). To manage the severity of SE, animals received 
diazepam 5min after the SE onset (acute group: 2.5 or 1.25mg/kg; i.p.; chronic
group/; 1.25mg/kg; i.p). All animals were monitored by video and
electrocorticography to assess SE and subsequent spontaneous recurrent seizures
(SRS). To evaluate brain injury produced by SE or SRS we used argyrophil III,
Nissl and neo-Timm staining techniques. Magnetic resonance image was also
performed in the chronic group. We observed that pilocarpine was able to induce
SE followed by SRS after a variable period of time. Prolonged SE episodes were
associated with brain damage, mostly confined to the hippocampus and limbic
structures. Similar to human TLE, anatomical disruption of dentate gyrus was
observed after SRS. Our data suggest that pilocarpine marmoset model of epilepsy 
has great resemblance to human TLE, and could provide new tools to further
evaluate the subtle changes associated with human epilepsy.

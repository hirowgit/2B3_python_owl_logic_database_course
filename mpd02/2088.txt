The attrition rate of new drugs for central nervous system diseases including
multiple sclerosis (MS) is very high. A widely recognized bottleneck in the
selection of promising central nervous system drug candidates from the
development pipeline is the lack of sufficiently predictive animal models. Here, 
we review how the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model in the
Neotropical primate "common marmoset" can help to bridge the gap between rodent
EAE models and MS. The EAE model in the marmoset closely resembles MS in the
clinical as well as pathological presentation and can be used for fundamental
research into immunopathogenic mechanisms and for therapy development. We discuss
recent insights arising from this model, both on novel therapeutics and
immunopathogenesis.

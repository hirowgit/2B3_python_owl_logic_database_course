The serum albumin gene family is comprised of albumin, alpha-fetoprotein,
alpha-albumin (afamin), and the more distantly related Vitamin D binding protein.
These genes arose from a common ancestor through a series of duplication events, 
are expressed primarily in the liver and tightly linked in all species where this
has been investigated. Here, we describe a fifth member of the albumin gene
family that we have named Alpha-fetoprotein Related Gene (ARG) since it exhibits 
greatest similarity to this family member. ARG is activated in the liver
perinatally, but is expressed at very low levels. The ARG gene is present and
intact in the mouse, rat, dog and horse genomes. In contrast, the ARG gene in
human, chimpanzee, rhesus monkey, and marmoset contains a number of mutations
common to all four species, indicating that this gene has been an inactive
pseudogene in primates for at least 40 million years. Low expression and aberrant
splicing of the ARG gene in the mouse liver suggests that ARG may have less
functional significance than other members of the serum albumin gene family even 
in species where it is still intact.

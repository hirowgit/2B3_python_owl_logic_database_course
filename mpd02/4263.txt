The karyotype of Cebuella pygmaea (2n = 44) obtained by G-, C-banding, and
NOR-staining is described. This species presents a heteromorphic C band in the
intersticial region of the short arm of chromosome 2. The data obtained were
compared with those previously described for the karyotypes of Callithrix jacchus
and Callithrix emiliae. The three species differ in the amount and distribution
of non-centromeric constitutive heterochromatin. The importance of the variation 
in constitutive heterochromatin for the phylogeny of the group is discussed.
Comparison of the karyotypes in terms of G-banding patterns showed that C.
pygmaea and C. emiliae differ from C. jacchus by a Robertsonian translocation and
a paracentric inversion, whereas C. pygmaea and C. emiliae differ from each other
by a reciprocal translocation between an acrocentric autosome and the short arm
of the submetacentric chromosomes that distinguishes their karyotypes from that
of C. jacchus. The possible evolutionary paths followed by the karyotypes of the 
three species are discussed.

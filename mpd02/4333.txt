Aged common marmosets were treated with
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP; 0.5-2.0 mg/kg/week i.p.) for 
16 or 24 weeks, observed for a total of 30 weeks and then killed for measurement 
of biochemical parameters in basal ganglia. The MPTP treatment induced a marked
depletion in dopamine, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and homovanillic acid
levels in the caudate nucleus and putamen. In contrast, the concentrations of
five neuropeptides: [Met5]-enkephalin, [Leu5]-enkephalin, cholecystokinin,
substance P and neurotensin as measured by a combined HPLC/RIA method, remained
unaltered in all basal ganglia regions examined. Enkephalin precursor levels, as 
reflected by cryptic [Met5]-enkephalin content, were increased in the putamen,
but not in the caudate nucleus, as a consequence of MPTP administration. Cryptic 
[Leu5]-enkephalin content remained unchanged in the striatum of MPTP treated
marmosets. Overall, these results suggest an increase in striatal
[Met5]-enkephalin release following chronic MPTP treatment of aged marmosets.
However, the chronic treatment of aged marmosets with MPTP does not reproduce the
neuropeptide alterations characteristic of Parkinson's disease.

Post-conflict (PC) affiliation has been demonstrated in a number of Old World
monkeys and apes, but very little is known about the occurrence of the phenomenon
in New World monkeys. This study examined 282 PC interactions after spontaneous
conflicts around feeding time in two family groups (N = 12) of captive common
marmosets, Callithrix jacchus jacchus. We found an overall corrected conciliatory
tendency of 31%. Selective attraction was seen: former opponents met
significantly more often in PCs than in matched controls (MCs) (27% and 16%,
respectively). There was no difference in the occurrence of PC affiliation
between dyads consisting of parent-offspring constellations compared to
offspring-offspring constellations. PC affiliative behaviors were seen in the
first three minutes following conflict termination, and consisted mainly of
proximity, play invitations, and food transfer. Notably, former opponents
remained within arm's reach after 17% of conflicts. Affiliation was more likely
to follow after conflicts involving play issues. The functional importance of the
PC affiliation in marmosets remains to be examined.

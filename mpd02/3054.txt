A quantitative theory is proposed for the nonexponential NMR proton signal decay 
observed in liver with iron overload or superparamagnetic iron oxide particles.
This effect occurs for Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) sequences and is argued
to be a direct consequence of the strong magnetic field inhomogeneities generated
by the iron, rather than being due to tissue compartments. An approximate
mathematical form is given for the signal decay, which is fit to experimental
data for samples of rat liver with iron oxide particles, for samples of marmoset 
liver with hemosiderosis, and for in vivo human liver with hereditary
hemochromatosis. The fitting parameters obtained are consistent with the pattern 
of iron deposition determined from histology. For the case of hereditary
hemochromatosis, a good correlation is found between a parameter characterizing
the nonexponential decay and the iron concentration. Implications for practical
MR quantification of hepatic iron are discussed.

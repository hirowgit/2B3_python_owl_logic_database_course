This report describes a new modification of the Gallyas method for staining
myelin in fixed brain tissue and compares results of multiple myelin-visualizing 
techniques in normal common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), normal macaque monkey 
(Macaca mulatta), and a human with multiple sclerosis. The new modification
involves immersion in 10% formalin following impregnation in ammoniacal silver
nitrate, and the use of a low concentration of 4% paraformaldehyde in the
developer. This improved technique is less sensitive to post-mortem tissue
handling, temperature, and minor contaminants, allowing a more straightforward
implementation in the laboratory setting. It permits simple user-controlled
development of the reaction product to maximize contrast in the area of interest,
resulting in high contrast staining not only of large axonal bundles, but also
thin fascicles throughout tissue sections. Myelin staining in visual cortex of an
Old World monkey and a New World monkey reveals similar patterns in the new
myelin silver stain, the Gallyas stain, and myelin basic protein
immunohistochemistry. The most heavily myelinated areas occupy the edges of
blobs, but neither the most lightly stained nor the most darkly stained areas are
always in our outside a blob. This indicates a more complex pattern between
myelinated axons and blobs than previously suggested. While the new myelin silver
stain, darkfield microscopy, the Luxol Fast Blue stain, the Gallyas stain, and
myelin basic protein immunohistochemistry all permit visualization of myelin in
the CNS, each technique has its own merits and pitfalls; careful evaluation of
individual study requirements would best determine which methods are the most
useful.

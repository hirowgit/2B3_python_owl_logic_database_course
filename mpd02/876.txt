Operant-conditioning boxes are widely used in animal training, allowing
researchers to shape specific behaviors through reinforcements and/or
punishments. Commercially available devices are expensive and run with
proprietary software and hardware, hampering adaptations for the specific needs
of an experiment. Therefore, many low-cost and open-source devices have recently 
been developed, but there are still few options for studying auditory behaviors. 
To overcome this problem, we developed a device based on a computer and an
Arduino Mega 2560 board, named OBAT (Operant Box for Auditory Tasks), designed to
present two different auditory stimuli to small primates. It has three modules:
sound delivery, response bars, and reward system. We estimate that OBAT is at
least 4-10 times cheaper than commercially available operant-conditioning boxes. 
Data from a behavioral pilot test ensured that the device can be used to train a 
marmoset in an auditory discrimination task. In addition, despite its low cost,
accuracy tests showed that the OBAT operates with a high temporal precision. All 
schematics and software source code are available so that other groups can easily
replicate the experiment or adapt the device to their own needs.

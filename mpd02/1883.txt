Common marmosets have been used extensively in biomedical research and the recent
advent of techniques to generate transgenic marmosets has accelerated the use of 
this model. New methods that efficiently assess the degree of cognitive function 
in common marmosets are needed in order to establish their suitability as
non-human primate models of higher brain function disorders. Here, we have
developed a new apparatus suitable for testing the cognitive functions of common 
marmosets. Utilizing a mini laptop PC with a touch-sensitive screen as the main
component, the apparatus is small and lightweight and can be easily attached to
the home cages. The ease of designing and testing new paradigms with the flexible
software is another advantage of this system. We have tested visual
discrimination and its reversal tasks using this apparatus and confirmed its
efficacy.

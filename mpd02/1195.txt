OBJECTIVES: Platyrrhines span two orders of magnitude in body size and are
characterized by diverse feeding behaviors and diets. While size plays an
important role in primate feeding behavior and masticatory apparatus morphology, 
we know little about size-correlated changes in the force-generating (physiologic
cross-sectional area; PCSA) and excursion/stretch (fiber length; Lf )
capabilities of the jaw-closing muscles in platyrrhines.
METHODS: We examined scaling relationships of the superficial masseter and
temporalis muscles in 21 platyrrhine species. Previous work suggests that larger 
platyrrhines are at a mechanical disadvantage for generating bite forces compared
with smaller platyrrhines. We hypothesize that scaling of jaw-muscle fiber
architecture counters this size-correlated decrease in mechanical advantage.
Thus, we predicted that jaw-muscle PCSAs and muscle weights scale with positive
allometry while Lf s scale with negative allometry, relative to load-arm
estimates for incisor/molar biting and chewing.
RESULTS: Jaw-muscle PCSAs and Lf s appear to scale with negative allometry
relative to load-arm estimates and body size. Negative allometry of jaw-muscle
weights partially accounts for the size-correlated decreases in PCSA and Lf .
Estimates of bite force also scale with negative allometry.
CONCLUSION: Large-bodied platyrrhines (e.g., Alouatta) are at a relative
disadvantage for generating jaw-muscle and bite force as well as jaw-muscle
stretch, compared with smaller species (e.g., Callithrix). The net effect is that
larger platyrrhines likely produce relatively smaller maximal bite forces
compared with smaller taxa. Relative to small- and intermediate-sized
platyrrhines, large-bodied platyrrhines feed on some of the least mechanically
challenging foods, consistent with the size-correlated decrease in relative
muscle and bite forces across the clade. Am J Phys Anthropol, 2015. © 2015 Wiley

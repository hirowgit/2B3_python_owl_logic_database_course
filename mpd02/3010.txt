Membrane cofactor protein (MCP; CD46) regulates the complement cascade by
inhibiting C3b and C4b deposited on self tissue. This function resides in the
complement control protein repeats (CCPs), with CCPs 2-4 essential for
regulation. MCP is expressed on the inner acrosomal membrane of human sperm, and 
Abs to CCP1 inhibit sperm-egg interactions. In somatic tissues, New World monkeys
express an alternatively spliced form of MCP lacking CCP1. Although retaining
complement-regulatory activity, this form is postulated to render these species
less susceptible to strains of the measles virus whose hemagglutinin requires
CCP1 and CCP2 for attachment. Using PCR, sequencing, Western blotting, and
immunohistochemistry, we characterized MCP expression in the testes and sperm of 
two New World monkeys. In these species, sperm express MCP bearing CCP1. The germ
cell-specific expression pattern of this domain strongly suggests an
evolutionarily conserved role for MCP in fertilization.

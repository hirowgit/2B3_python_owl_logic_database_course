An allometric study of hippocampal components. A comparative study of the brains 
of the European hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus), the tree shrew (Tupaia glis), and
the marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus).

West MJ, Schwerdtfeger WK.

Brains of western European hedgehogs, common tree shrews and common marmosets
were perfused and stained according to Timm's method. The volumes of hippocampal 
components were determined with semiautomated quantitative techniques and
compared by allometric methods. The results support previous findings that the
size of the hippocampus in marmosets and tree shrews is about twice that of the
hippocampus of the European hedgehogs of the same body weight. Three hippocampal 
substructures account for most of this progression. These are the hilus, the deep
zone of the molecular layer of the area dentata, and CA1 (especially the cellular
layer) of Ammon's horn.

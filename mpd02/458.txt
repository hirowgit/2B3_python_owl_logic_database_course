Clostridium difficile is a well-documented cause of enterocolitis in several
species, including humans, with limited documentation in New World nonhuman
primates. We report several cases of C. difficile-associated pseudomembranous
enterocolitis, including a case in a Geoffroy's spider monkey (Ateles geoffroyi) 
and several cases in common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus). The histologic
lesions included a spectrum of severity, with most cases characterized by the
classic "volcano" lesions described in humans and several other animal species.
C. difficile was isolated from the colon of the spider monkey, while the presence
of toxin A or toxin B or of the genes of toxin A or B by polymerase chain
reaction served as corroborative evidence in several affected marmosets. C.
difficile should be considered a cause of enterocolitis in these species.

The use of the common marmoset monkey in biomedical research has increased
recently, and further attention has been devoted to this model after the
successful production of transgenic marmosets. To extend genetic engineering
approaches to widespread biomedical research fields, efficient prolonged in vitro
culturing of embryo development is necessary. We aimed to evaluate the effects of
the size of the zona pellucida opening on promoting the hatching process in the
marmoset embryo. Piezo-microdrilling of a 6-μm opening in eight embryos resulted 
in four partially hatched embryos and one hatched embryo after 5 days of culture.
Piezo-microdrilling a 20-μm opening in 11 embryos resulted in nine partial
hatchings and no hatched embryos. Piezo-scraping an 80-μm opening in six embryos 
resulted in no partially hatched embryos and five hatched embryos. These results 
suggest that an 80-μm opening, rather than 6-μm or 20-μm openings, is suitable to
complete the hatching process in the marmoset embryo.

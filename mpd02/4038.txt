Productive infection of marmoset blood mononuclear cells by the Epstein-Barr
virus was generally achieved by the co-cultivation method. By introducing 2
modifications, the success rate of infection was increased from 6% to 79%. The
modifications consisted of the selection of human lymphocyte donors to serve as
carriers of Epstein-Barr virus in cocultures, and the addition of cyclosporin A
to culture media. So far, 10 of 10 wild type oropharyngeal EBV have been
propagated successfully in cultures of marmoset blood mononuclear cells by the
modified procedure. Fragment length polymorphism study failed to reveal any
difference between viral genomes in human lymphocytes and that in marmoset blood 
mononuclear cells. Antigenic analysis of 8 wild strains showed that all were
related to the B95-8 strain of Epstein-Barr virus by the neutralization test.

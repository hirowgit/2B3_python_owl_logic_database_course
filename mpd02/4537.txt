In one species each of the subfamilies marmosets and tamarins of the New World
monkey family Callithricidae, serum levels of ascorbic acid were compared.
Although the feeding regimen had been the same for both species for several
years, the average concentration of serum ascorbate in the tamarins Saguinus
fuscicollis (n = 21; 0.54 +/- 0.29 mg/100 ml) was only one-fifth that of the
marmosets Callithrix jacchus (n = 19; 2.56 +/- 1.07 mg).

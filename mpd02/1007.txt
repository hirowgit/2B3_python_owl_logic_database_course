Complex motor skills of eventual benefit can be learned after considerable trial 
and error. What do structural brain changes that accompany such effortful
long-term learning tell us about the mechanisms for developing innovative
behavior? Using MRI, we monitored brain structure before, during and after four
marmosets learnt to use a rake, over a long period of 10-13 months. Throughout
learning, improvements in dexterity and visuo-motor co-ordination correlated with
increased volume in the lateral extrastriate cortex. During late learning, when
the most complex behavior was maintained by sustained motivation to acquire the
skill, the volume of the nucleus accumbens increased. These findings reflect the 
motivational state required to learn, and show accelerated function in higher
visual cortex that is consistent with neurocognitive divergence across a spectrum
of primate species.

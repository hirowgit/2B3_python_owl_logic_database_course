Two systems are described for the collection of 24 h urine samples from the
common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). Using 84 adult animals, 1210 24-h samples
were collected. Mean urinary excretion was 14.4 +/- 7.5 ml/24 h (n = 1210, mean
+/- SD). No differences were observed between sexes (for 52 females, 24 h volume 
= 15.1 +/- 8.0 ml; for 32 males, 24 h volume = 12.5 +/- 6.0 ml). No significant
differences were observed between pregnant and non-pregnant females with respect 
to 24 h urine volume, and bilateral gonadectomy did not influence subsequent
urinary excretion in either sex. For 161 pairs of observations, the intake of
drinking water (11.7 +/- 10.2 ml/24 h) and the volume of urine excreted (12.6 +/-
7.1 ml/24 h) showed a positive correlation (r = 0.406 d.f. 159, P less than
0.001: y = 0.558x + 4.247).

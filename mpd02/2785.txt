The maturation of pyramidal neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) of marmoset
monkeys was investigated using an antibody (SMI-32) to non-phosphorylated
neurofilament protein (NNF). Analysis of animals aged between birth and postnatal
day 91 (PD 91, which corresponds approximately to the peak of synaptogenesis in
this species) revealed discrete changes in both the laminar and the areal
distribution of NNF. At PD 0, the upper part of layer 6 contained darkly labelled
neurons and associated neuropil, including axons. In this layer a
centroperipheral gradient, with more labelled cells in the foveal representation,
was apparent at PD 0. This topographic gradient gradually disappeared, and by PD 
91 a similar density of labelled layer 6 cells was observed throughout V1.
Labelled cells were not apparent in layer 3C until PD 7, and were not distributed
according to a topographic gradient. Labelled cells were first observed in layer 
3B(alpha) at PD 28, when they formed a centroperipheral gradient similar to that 
seen in layer 6. This gradient was still evident in an adult animal. These
results demonstrate an inside-out profile of postnatal cortical development, with
the topographic pattern of maturation of V1 mimicking the centroperipheral
gradient of maturation in the retina.

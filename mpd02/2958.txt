The Stroke Therapy Academic Industry Roundtable noted the need for standardized, 
well-accepted primate models of stroke to help develop both neuroprotective and
restorative therapies. One primate model has been developed using the marmoset, a
small New World species of monkey, in which long-term functional deficits can be 
assessed. The surgery and postoperative care of the animals is described, as well
as the behavioral tests used to quantify the postoperative disability. The types 
of deficits seen are illustrated by reference to some of the findings with
neuroprotective treatments. Nevertheless, the long-term nature and consistency of
the motor deficits make this model ideal for assessing the worth of restorative
therapies.

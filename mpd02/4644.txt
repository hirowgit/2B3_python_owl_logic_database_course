Infectious mononucleosis-like response in common marmosets infected with
Epstein-Barr virus.

Wedderburn N, Edwards JM, Desgranges C, Fontaine C, Cohen B, de Th√© G.

Callithrix jacchus marmosets infected with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) with or
without concurrent treatment with cyclosporin A (CySA) remained healthy. Five
marmosets given virus alone developed lymphocytosis and heterophile antibody.
Antibody to EBV capsid antigens (VCA) appeared and remained at titers of
1:40-1:80 from 15 weeks onward. Two animals produced antibody to the R component 
of early antigens (EA) from six weeks onward. Five CySA-treated EBV-infected
marmosets showed no increase in total lymphocyte counts; only two developed
heterophile antibody. Four developed persistent antibody to the EA-R component.
All developed antibody to VCA, and mean titers were higher than in animals given 
EBV alone. Antibody to VCA also appeared in animals given EBV into Waldeyer's
ring. Because these responses to EBV resemble those of humans, C. jacchus may
provide a useful model for exploring the potential of cofactors in inducing
EBV-associated malignancy.

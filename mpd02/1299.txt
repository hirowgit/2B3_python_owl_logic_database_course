Positron emission tomography (PET) is a molecular imaging modality that can
visualize functional neurochemical processes throughout the brain in the living
condition, and is useful in bridging the gap between experimental animals and
humans. We applied PET to common marmosets to study the brain mechanisms
underlying social behaviors. Common marmosets are known for their high level of
sociality within a cooperative breeding system, which is rare among non-human
primates, and they could represent valuable animals for studying human-like
social behaviors. PET successfully revealed a brain-molecular relationship
underlying social traits and a functional brain network associated with social
situations in common marmosets. Marmoset PET appears likely to prove useful in
understanding the neurobiological mechanisms underpinning social behaviors in
both physiological and pathological conditions, and has potential for simulating 
psychiatric disorders.

In the marmoset Callithrix jacchus, ocular dominance columns (ODC) have been
reported to be present in young animals, but absent in adults (Spatz, 1989). We
have studied in juvenile and adult animals the postnatal organization of the
retino-geniculo-cortical afferents by means of transneuronal labeling. We show in
the present work that ODC are present in the primary visual cortex of Callithrix 
jacchus, both in the adult and in the juvenile animal. The present work confirms 
the presence of ODC in the visual cortex of juvenile marmoset before the end of
the first postnatal month. In 2-month-old animals, ODC are well demarcated in
IVcalpha and IVcbeta. In the adult marmosets, the present data clearly show that 
the primary visual cortex is also organized with ODC. In horizontal sections,
they form a mosaic through the ventral and dorsal calcarine cortex and through
the dorso-lateral occipital part of the striate cortex. In frontal sections,
their presence is manifest in IVcbeta within the calcarine cortex and they only
faintly appear in IVcalpha. These new findings are important since they underline
the usefulness of the adult New World Monkeys as a model in visual research.

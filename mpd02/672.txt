We studied personality, subjective well-being, and hair cortisol level, in common
marmosets Callithrix jacchus, a small, cooperatively breeding New World monkey,
by examining their associations with one another and genotypes. Subjects were 68 
males and 9 females that lived in the RIKEN Center for Life Science Technologies.
Personality and subjective well-being were assessed by keeper ratings on two
questionnaires, hair samples were obtained to assay cortisol level and buccal
swabs were used to assess AVPR1a, OPRM1 and DAT genotypes. Three personality
domains-Dominance, Sociability, and Neuroticism-were identified. Consistent with 
findings in other species, Sociability and Neuroticism were related to higher and
lower subjective well-being, respectively. Sociability was also associated with
higher hair cortisol levels. The personality domains and hair cortisol levels
were heritable and associated with genotypes: the short form of AVPR1a was
associated with lower Neuroticism and the AA genotype of the A111T SNP of OPRM1
was related to lower Dominance, lower Neuroticism, and higher hair cortisol
level. Some genetic associations were not in directions that one would expect
given findings in other species. These findings provide insights into the
proximate and ultimate bases of personality in common marmosets, other primates
and humans.

L-DOPA was acutely or repeatedly administered to rats and common marmosets
(Callithrix jacchus) with unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) denervation of
the dopamine inputs to the forebrain. Using in situ hybridization it was found
that L-DOPA-treated animals exhibited a pronounced induction in the gene
expression of both c-jun and c-fos in striatum and cerebral cortex restricted to 
the dopamine-depleted hemisphere. In contrast, acute treatment with cocaine
induced c-fos mRNA, but not c-jun mRNA, in the striatum of normal animals. These 
data suggest that dopamine denervation leads to neurochemical adaptations which
enables L-DOPA to induce a sustained gene expression of c-jun. Such aberrant gene
regulation may underlie the development of L-DOPA-induced movement disorders
which are commonly found in patients with Parkinson's disease.

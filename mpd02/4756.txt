Improved morphological techniques for screening potentially ototoxic compounds in
laboratory animals.

Astbury PJ, Read NG.

A technique is described for morphological examination of the organ of Corti
which can be used in routine toxicological studies. This involves the dissection 
of a critical point-dried cochlea and examination of a surface preparation of the
entire organ by scanning electron microscopy. The procedure is simple and far
less time consuming than that previously used for light microscopy. Quantitative 
estimates of damage induced in the organ of Corti either by the administration of
ototoxic compounds or as a response to noise-induced or age-related changes can
be obtained. Details are given for the application of this technique to two
species commonly used in toxicity studies. With minor modifications it could be
applied to many other species of animal.

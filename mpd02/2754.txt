An intraspinal inoculation test of mumps virus using marmosets was performed in
order to develop a neurovirulence test of mumps vaccines. In the group inoculated
with non-neurovirulent Jeryl Lynn vaccine strain at 10(2.0) pfu/dose, there were 
only minimal histopathological changes in 3 of the 5 marmosets. In contrast, all 
marmosets inoculated with neurovirulent Urabe and NK-M46 vaccine strains
developed extensive encephalitis and meningitis. Thus, this marmoset model, which
can distinguish between non-neurovirulent and neurovirulent vaccine strains, is
useful for evaluating neurovirulence of vaccine strains and elucidating the
molecular pathogenesis of mumps.

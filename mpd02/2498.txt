Human adults generally find fast tempos more arousing than slow tempos, with
tempo frequently manipulated in music to alter tension and emotion. We used a
previously published method [McDermott, J., & Hauser, M. (2004). Are consonant
intervals music to their ears? Spontaneous acoustic preferences in a nonhuman
primate. Cognition, 94(2), B11-B21] to test cotton-top tamarins and common
marmosets, two new-World primates, for their spontaneous responses to stimuli
that varied systematically with respect to tempo. Across several experiments, we 
found that both tamarins and marmosets preferred slow tempos to fast. It is
possible that the observed preferences were due to arousal, and that this effect 
is homologous to the human response to tempo. In other respects, however, these
two monkey species showed striking differences compared to humans. Specifically, 
when presented with a choice between slow tempo musical stimuli, including
lullabies, and silence, tamarins and marmosets preferred silence whereas humans, 
when similarly tested, preferred music. Thus despite the possibility of
homologous mechanisms for tempo perception in human and nonhuman primates, there 
appear to be motivational ties to music that are uniquely human.

While common marmosets are increasingly used as alternative primate models in
biomedical research, their life history, specialized behavior and unique
physiology are not well known. This paper describes important marmoset attributes
that are particularly relevant for biomedical research, including reproduction,
neurobiology, immunology, endocrine signaling, obesity and aging, in addition to 
fetal and postnatal development. While common marmosets exhibit characteristic
anthropoid primate traits, they clearly differ from Old World primates and humans
in a variety of functions, including reproduction, endocrine signaling and
immunology. These differences, however, permit the use of common marmosets in
unconventional research strategies targeted on human pathology.

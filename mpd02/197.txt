We previously reported the efficient targeted introduction of transgenes into the
genomic DNA of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) using CRISPR-Cas9. In
this study, we generated a marmoset embryonic stem cell (ESC) line that
ubiquitously expresses the tamoxifen-inducible Cre-driver ERT2CreERT2. We
validated the pluripotency of the ESC line and also successfully demonstrated the
temporal control of the Cre-driver in a tamoxifen-dependent manner in the ESCs.
This ESC line, named ActiCre-B1, will be a valuable resource for in vitro
investigation of phenotypes related to embryonic lethality by targeted knockout
of functionally important genes.

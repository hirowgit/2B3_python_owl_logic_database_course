Many behaviors of interest to neurophysiologists are difficult to study under
laboratory conditions because such behaviors are often inhibited when an animal
is restrained and socially isolated. Even under the best conditions, such
behaviors may be sparse enough as to require long duration neural recordings or
simultaneous recording of multiple neurons to gather a sufficient amount of data 
for analysis. We have developed a preparation for chronic, multi-electrode
recordings in the auditory cortex of marmoset monkeys, small primates, as well as
techniques for neurophysiological recordings when the animals are free-roaming
while singly caged in the environment of the monkey colony. In this report, we
describe our solutions to overcome the problems associated with chronic
recordings in free-roaming animals, where three-dimensional movements present
particular challenges.

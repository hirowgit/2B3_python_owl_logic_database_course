Staphylococcal enterotoxins (SEs) are extracellular proteins, produced mainly by 
Staphylococcus aureus, which cause staphylococcal food poisoning (SFP) when
ingested. Here, a novel SE was identified from two strains, which were identified
as the causative microbes of the SFP outbreak that occurred in Tokyo in 2004.
Both strains harbored the SEA gene, but its production was lower than that of
other SEA-producing SFP isolates. Whole-genome sequencing analysis demonstrated
that both strains harbored a SE-like gene besides sea. Phylogenetic analysis
revealed that the amino acid sequence deduced from the SE-like gene belonged to
the SEB group. Therefore, this gene was presumed to be a novel SE gene and termed
"SE02." The stability of SE02 against heating and proteolytic digestions was a
little different from that of SEA. SE02 has both superantigenic and emetic
bioactivities. Namely, SE02 activated mouse splenocytes and exhibited emetic
activity in the common marmoset. SE02 mRNA was highly expressed in both isolates 
during the exponential phase of cultivation. In addition, SE02 protein was
produced at 20 °C and 25 °C, which reflects the actual situation of SFP. SE02
appears to be a novel emetic toxin that was likely the causative toxin in
combination with SEA in the SFP outbreak.

Lymphocytes express potassium channels that regulate physiological cell
functions, such as activation, proliferation and migration. Expression levels of 
K2P5.1 (TASK2; KCNK5) channels belonging to the family of two-pore domain
potassium channels have previously been correlated to the activity of
autoreactive T lymphocytes in patients with multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid
arthritis. In humans, K2P5.1 channels are upregulated upon T cell stimulation and
influence T cell effector functions. However, a further clinical translation of
targeting K2P5.1 is currently hampered by a lack of highly selective inhibitors, 
making it necessary to evaluate the impact of KCNK5 in established preclinical
animal disease models. We here demonstrate that K2P5.1 knockout (K2P5.1-/-) mice 
display no significant alterations concerning T cell cytokine production,
proliferation rates, surface marker molecules or signaling pathways. In an
experimental model of autoimmune neuroinflammation, K2P5.1-/- mice show a
comparable disease course to wild-type animals and no major changes in the
peripheral immune system or CNS compartment. A compensatory upregulation of the
potassium channels K2P3.1 and KV1.3 seems to counterbalance the deletion of
K2P5.1. As an alternative model mimicking autoimmune neuroinflammation,
experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in the common marmoset has been
proposed, especially for testing the efficacy of new potential drugs. Initial
experiments show that K2P5.1 is functionally expressed on marmoset T lymphocytes,
opening up the possibility for assessing future K2P5.1-targeting drugs.

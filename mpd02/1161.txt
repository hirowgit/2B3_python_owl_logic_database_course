PURPOSE: The evolutionary conservation of the retinitis pigmentosa GTPase
regulator (RPGR) gene was examined across vertebrate and invertebrate lineages to
elucidate its function.
METHODS: Orthologous RPGR sequences from vertebrates and invertebrates were
selected. Multiple sequence alignments, phylogenetic analyses, synteny, and gene 
structure comparisons were carried out. Expression of the alternatively spliced
constitutive (RPGR(const) or RPGR(ex1-19)) and RPGR(ORF15) isoforms was examined 
in developing and adult zebrafish.
RESULTS: Phylogenetic analyses and syntenic relationships were consistent with
the selected sequences being true orthologues, although whole genome duplications
in teleost fish resulted in a more complex picture. The splice form RPGR(const)
was present in all vertebrate and invertebrate species but the defining carboxyl 
(C)-terminal exon of RPGR(ORF15) was absent from all invertebrates. The regulator
of chromosome condensation (RCC1)-like domain adopts a seven-bladed β-propeller
structure, which was present in both major splice forms and strongly conserved
across evolution. The repetitive acidic region of RPGR(ORF15) showed a high rate 
of in-frame deletions/insertions across nine primate species, compared with
flanking sequences, consistent with an unstable and rapidly evolving region. In
zebrafish, RPGR(const) transcripts were most strongly expressed in early
development, while the RPGR(ORF15) isoform showed highest expression in adult
eye.
CONCLUSIONS: The regulator of chromosome condensation 1-like domain of RPGR was
conserved in vertebrates and invertebrates, but RPGR(ORF15) was unique to
vertebrates, consistent with a proposed role in the ciliary-based transport of
cargoes such as rhodopsin, which is ∼10 times more abundant in vertebrate than
invertebrate photoreceptors. The repetitive acidic region of RPGR(ORF15) shows a 
rapid rate of evolution, consistent with a mutation "hot spot."

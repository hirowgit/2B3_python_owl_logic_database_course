Presently, the State of Ceará reports the largest percentage of human rabies
cases originated from wild animals in Brazil, transmitted by the principal simian
species, the tamarin (Callithrix jacchus), found in various locations throughout 
the State, but concentrated along the coast. Epidemiological studies indicated
that possibly the same virus caused the deaths in humans and non-human primates. 
This rabies virus seem to be different from all other identified so far.

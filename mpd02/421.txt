Resting-state functional MRI (RS-fMRI) is widely used to assess how strongly
different brain areas are connected. However, this connection obtained by
RS-fMRI, which is called functional connectivity (FC), simply refers to the
correlation of blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals across time it has yet
to be quantified how accurately FC reflects cellular connectivity (CC). In this
study, we elucidated this relationship using RS-fMRI and quantitative tracer data
in marmosets. In addition, we also elucidated the effects of distance between two
brain regions on the relationship between FC and CC across seed region. To
calculate FC, we used full correlation approach that is considered to reflect not
only direct (monosynaptic connections) but also indirect pathways (polysynaptic
connections). Our main findings are that: (1) overall FC obtained by RS-fMRI was 
highly correlated with tracer-based CC, but correlation coefficients varied
remarkably across seed regions; (2) the strength of FC decreased with increase in
the distance between two regions; (3) correlation coefficients between FC and CC 
after regressing out the effects of the distance between two regions still varied
across seed regions, but some regions have strong correlations. These findings
suggest that although FC reflects the strength of monosynaptic pathways, it is
strongly affected by the distance between regions.

Data from a large series of experiments on marmosets with lesions of the
septal/diagonal band area (DB), fornix or CA1 area of the hippocampus are
analysed in terms of retention of information learned before surgery, acquisition
of new information and retention of information acquired after surgery. It is
shown that although all three lesions impair acquisition of a specific type of
new information, lesions of CA1 result in a severe retrograde amnesia but no
forgetting of that type of information adequately acquired after surgery, whereas
lesions of the DB do not cause retrograde amnesia but do result in significant
forgetting. Monkeys with fornix transection occupied an intermediate position in 
their pattern of learning impairments; some animals showed evidence of
forgetting, whereas the great majority showed retrograde amnesia. These data may 
be relevant to an understanding of the different extent of amnesia in patients
with different pathology within the medial temporal lobe and associated
subcortical structures.

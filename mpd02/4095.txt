Glibenclamide, one of the most potent antidiabetic sulfonylureas, inhibits the
activity of ATP-sensitive K+ channels in the pancreas as well as in the brain
through its binding to specific receptors. Quantitative autoradiography was used 
to localize such receptors in the brain of rat, mouse, guinea-pig and marmoset,
using [3H]glibenclamide as radioligand. In all four species, specific
glibenclamide binding sites were found to be heterogeneously distributed. The
highest densities were in the cerebral cortex, the molecular layer of the
cerebellar cortex, the thalamus and the caudate-putamen. The globus pallidus and 
the substantia nigra were highly labelled in rat and mouse but poorly labelled in
guinea-pig and marmoset. The distribution of glibenclamide binding sites in the
hippocampus was different between the rodents and marmoset; in rodents, most
binding sites were distributed in the fascia dentata and the CA3-CA4 fields of
Ammon's horn, contrasting with a very homogeneous distribution in all subfields
of the marmoset hippocampus. In conclusion, we demonstrate that primate brain
contains specific binding sites for [3H]glibenclamide with a distribution not
exactly similar to that in rodent brain.

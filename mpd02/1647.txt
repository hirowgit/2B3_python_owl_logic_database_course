BACKGROUND: Vitamin D is a secosteroid hormone with important roles in the
control of bone and mineral metabolism of vertebrates and in the maintenance of
systemic homeostasis. This study aimed (i) to evaluate the serum concentrations
of 25-hydroxy-vitamin D levels [25(OH)D], parathyroid hormone (PTH) and ionized
calcium (iCa) of wild Callithrix penicillata (black-tufted marmosets) and (ii) to
propose reference ranges for those analytes for free-living marmosets.
METHODS: Blood samples were collected from 15 wild animals and analyzed for
25(OH)D, PTH and iCa. Reference values were calculated following standard
analytical criteria.
RESULTS: The observed mean serum levels (±standard deviation) were 25(OH)D, 61.7 
(±20.8) ng/ml; PTH, 275.2 (±34.1) pg/ml; iCai 4.0 (±0.6) mg/dl.
CONCLUSIONS: For free-living marmosets, the proposed physiological range for
25(OH)D is 20.1-103.3 ng/ml and for PTH is 207.0-343.3 pg/dl, with a confidence
interval of 95%.

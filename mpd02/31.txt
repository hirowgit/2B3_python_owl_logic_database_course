Hepatic steatosis, also known as fatty liver, is a spontaneous lesion caused by
the abnormal accumulation of triglycerides within hepatocytes that has been
described in different laboratory-housed nonhuman primate species. Aging is
considered a risk factor in the progression of this lesion in humans and captive 
rhesus macaques. Hepatic steatosis has been reported in sexually mature adult and
aged-adult captive common marmosets. Macroscopic changes in the liver may be
evident in advanced stages of this condition and are characterized by
hepatomegaly with multifocal to coalescing to regionally extensive pale-tan to
yellow, soft foci throughout the hepatic lobes. Biochemical abnormalities in
these cases include significantly increased levels in triglycerides, insulin, and
Î³-glutamyltransferase (GGT). Definitive diagnosis is by histopathology and
demonstration of lipid accumulation within hepatocytes. Histopathology is
characterized by large coalescing areas of periacinar to periportal
microvesicular steatosis mixed with clusters of macrovesicular steatosis, and
variable degrees of lobular inflammation. Vacuolated hepatocytes containing
intracytoplasmic lipid material is demonstrated by positive staining to Sudan IV 
and/or Oil red-O.

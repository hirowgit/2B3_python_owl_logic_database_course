Subordinate female common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) undergo ovulation
suppression and exhibit low plasma cortisol levels compared to the dominant,
breeding female. To determine whether this cortisol difference is mediated by the
differential reproductive consequences of social status, we monitored plasma
progesterone and cortisol in 32 adult female marmosets while they were housed in 
heterosexual pairs, during the first 3 days of heterosexual group formation, and 
while animals were housed in established social groups. Cortisol levels prior to 
group formation were significantly higher in females exhibiting cyclic ovulatory 
activity than in anovulatory females but were not predictive of social status.
Subsequently, when animals were housed in established social groups, dominant
(cyclic) females had significantly higher cortisol levels than did subordinate
(anovulatory) females. Cortisol levels differed between the pre and postgroup
formation conditions only in animals that underwent a corresponding onset or
termination of ovulatory cyclicity. Cortisol differences between dominant and
subordinate female marmosets therefore appear to be associated with differences
in reproductive function rather than with social status per se.

Anteromedial hypothalamic lesions block proceptivity but not receptivity in the
female common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).

Kendrick KM, Dixson AF.

The sexual behavior of 8, estradiol-treated, ovariectomized common marmosets was 
recorded prior to and after bilateral radiofrequency lesions of the hypothalamus.
Lesions of the anterior hypothalamus, which extended to varying degrees into the 
medial hypothalamus, virtually abolished proceptive tongue-flicking and staring
displays. Tongue-flicking during copulation also decreased, but the females did
not show any significant increase in the number of mounts which they refused or
terminated with the exception of one animal which had received more extensive
damage to the medial hypothalamus. Significant increases in the frequencies of
allogrooming and grooming invitations also occurred after the females had been
lesioned. Sexual behavior was not significantly altered in 3 females which
received sham lesions. These results provide the first direct evidence for a
neuroanatomical distinction between hypothalamic mechanisms which regulate
proceptivity and receptivity in primates.

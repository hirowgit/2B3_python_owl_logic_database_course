OBJECTIVE: To investigate the horizontal transmission of virus after inoculation 
with live attenuated hepatitis A vaccine.
METHODS: One hundred and ninety nine children aged 4 approximately 7 years
without anti-HAV and with normal ALT level have been screened out at two trial
fields in Anning, Kunming and divided into vaccine group (82 children) and
contact group (117 children) to observe the horizontal transmission of the live
attenuated hepatitis A vaccine virus (H2 strain). Four supernatant specimens of
HAV positive fecal suspension derived from individual vaccines and contacts were 
taken and injected intravenousely into 8 common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) for
detecting the virulence level of HAV.
RESULTS: The rates of seroconversion were 97.6% (80/82) for vaccine group 6 weeks
after inoculation and 13.7% (16/117) for contact group at the ninth week of
observation. The detection rates of fecal HAV were 89.5% (34/38) and 70.7%
(53/75), respectively. No liver functional abnormality has been found in either
groups. The responses of 8 marmosets separately infected with fecal shedding HAV 
of 2 vaccines and 2 contacts have been examined with neither elevations of serum 
liver enzyme nor liver histopathological changes but delay seroconversions as
well as low titers of anti-HAV.
CONCLUSION: The safety and immunogenicity live attenuated hepatitis A vaccine (H2
strain) were good. The vaccine virus could actively propagate but keep the
stability of attenuated characteristics in human bodies, and might result in
horizontal transmission but not induce hepatitis A in crowd.

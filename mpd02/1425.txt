We studied the functional connectivity of cells in the lateral geniculate nucleus
(LGN) with the primary visual cortex (V1) in anesthetized marmosets (Callithrix
jacchus). The LGN sends signals to V1 along parallel visual pathways called
parvocellular (P), magnocellular (M), and koniocellular (K). To better understand
how these pathways provide inputs to V1, we antidromically activated relay cells 
in the LGN by electrically stimulating V1 and measuring the conduction latencies 
of P (n = 7), M (n = 14), and the "Blue-ON" (n = 5) subgroup of K cells (K-BON
cells). We found that the antidromic latencies of K-BON cells were similar to
those of P cells. We also measured the response latencies to high contrast visual
stimuli for a subset of cells. We found the LGN cells that have the shortest
latency of response to visual stimulation also have the shortest antidromic
latencies. We conclude that Blue color signals are transmitted directly to V1
from the LGN by K-BON cells.

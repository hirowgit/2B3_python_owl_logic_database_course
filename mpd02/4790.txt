Supplemental feeding of marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) triplets.

Ziegler TE, Stein FJ, Sis RF, Coleman MS, Green JH.

In a colony of marmosets (Callithrix jacchus), all fifteen infants from five sets
of triplet births were successfully reared with their parents. Two supplemental
feedings were given each infant daily. As an alternative to hand-rearing or
foster rearing, the supplemental feeding method eliminated the time-consuming
process of hand caring for an infant on a 24-hour per day basis.

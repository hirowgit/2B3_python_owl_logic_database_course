A mini-atlas of the brain is designed to help students and young researchers who 
are not familiar with neuroanatomy. In the mini-atlas, a limited number of
important nuclei and fiber tracts are shown on a small number of brain sections
from posterior end to the anterior end of the brain. The first mini-atlas was
introduced for the rat brain (Watson et al., 2010). Here we present a mini-atlas 
of the common marmoset (Callithrix jaccus), which is one of representative
experimental primates for modern neuroscience. We further discuss the differences
of brain structures between rodents and primates.

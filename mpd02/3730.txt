Coccidial parasites of the genus Isospora cause intestinal disease in several
mammalian host species. These protozoal parasites have asexual and sexual stages 
within intestinal cells of their hosts and produce an environmentally resistant
cyst stage, the oocyst. Infections are acquired by the ingestion of infective
(sporulated) oocysts in contaminated food or water. Some species of mammalian
Isospora have evolved the ability to use paratenic (transport) hosts. In these
cases, infections can be acquired by ingestion of an infected paratenic host.
Human intestinal isosporiasis is caused by Isospora belli. Symptoms of I. belli
infection in immunocompetent patients include diarrhea, steatorrhea, headache,
fever, malaise, abdominal pain, vomiting, dehydration, and weight loss, blood is 
not usually present in the feces. The disease is often chronic, with parasites
present in the feces or biopsy specimens for several months to years. Recurrences
are common, Symptoms are more severe in AIDS patients, with the diarrhea being
more watery. Extraintestinal stages of I. belli have been observed in AIDS
patients but not immunocompetent patients. Treatment of I. belli infection with
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole usually results in a rapid clinical response.
Maintenance treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is needed because
relapses often occur once treatment is stopped.

Primates of the subfamily Callitrichinae (Callimico, Callithrix, Leontopithecus, 
and Saguinus) are small-bodied New World monkeys (105-700 g) possessing clawlike 
nails on all manual and pedal digits excluding the hallux. Specialized nails in
these genera serve a critical function in feeding by enabling tamarins and
marmosets to cling to trunks and other large vertical supports while exploiting
food resources. Within the subfamily, there is evidence of at least four distinct
large-branch feeding patterns. These include (1) seasonal exudate feeding and
occasional trunk foraging (many Saguinus spp.); (2) exploitation of bark surface 
insects and the use of trunks as a platform to locate terrestrial prey (Saguinus 
fuscicollis, S. nigricollis, and Callimico); (3) manipulative foraging and bark
stripping to locate concealed insects and small vertebrates (Leontopithecus); and
(4) tree gouging and year-round exudate feeding (many Callithrix). Large-branch
feeding and the use of vertical clinging postures appear to be a primary
adaptation among virtually all callitrichines, distinguishing them ecologically
from other platyrrhine taxa. Given the anatomy and behavior of extant
callitrichines, Saguinus appears to be the most ecologically generalized member
of this subfamily, and species of this genus may provide useful models for
reconstructing the feeding and foraging adaptations of early callitrichines.

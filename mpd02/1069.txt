New drugs often fail in the translation from the rodent experimental autoimmune
encephalomyelitis (EAE) model to human multiple sclerosis (MS). Here, we present 
the marmoset EAE model as an indispensable model for translational research into 
MS. The genetic heterogeneity of this species and lifelong exposure to chronic
latent infections and environmental pathogens create a human-like immune system. 
Unique to this model is the presence of the pathological hallmark of progressive 
MS, in particular cortical grey matter lesions. Another great possibility of this
model is systemic and longitudinal immune profiling, whereas in humans and mice
immune profiling is usually performed in a single compartment (i.e. blood or
spleen, respectively). Overall, the marmoset model provides unique opportunities 
for systemic drug-effect profiling.

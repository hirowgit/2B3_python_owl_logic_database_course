Recent progress in understanding the structure of neural representations in the
cerebral cortex has centred around the application of multivariate classification
analyses to measurements of brain activity. These analyses have proved a
sensitive test of whether given brain regions provide information about specific 
perceptual or cognitive processes. An exciting extension of this approach is to
infer the structure of this information, thereby drawing conclusions about the
underlying neural representational space. These approaches rely on exploratory
data-driven dimensionality reduction to extract the natural dimensions of neural 
spaces, including natural visual object and scene representations, semantic and
conceptual knowledge, and working memory. However, the efficacy of these
exploratory methods is unknown, because they have only been applied to
representations in brain areas for which we have little or no secondary
knowledge. One of the best-understood areas of the cerebral cortex is area MT of 
primate visual cortex, which is known to be important in motion analysis. To
assess the effectiveness of dimensionality reduction for recovering neural
representational space we applied several dimensionality reduction methods to
multielectrode measurements of spiking activity obtained from area MT of marmoset
monkeys, made while systematically varying the motion direction and speed of
moving stimuli. Despite robust tuning at individual electrodes, and high
classifier performance, dimensionality reduction rarely revealed dimensions for
direction and speed. We use this example to illustrate important limitations of
these analyses, and suggest a framework for how to best apply such methods to
data where the structure of the neural representation is unknown.

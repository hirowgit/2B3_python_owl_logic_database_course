A crucial component of social cognition is to observe and understand the social
interactions of other individuals. A promising nonhuman primate model for
investigating the neural basis of social interaction observation is the common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a small New World primate that shares a rich
social repertoire with humans. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance
imaging acquired at 9.4 T to map the brain areas activated by social interaction 
observation in awake marmosets. We discovered a network of subcortical and
cortical areas, predominately in the anterior lateral frontal and medial frontal 
cortex, that was specifically activated by social interaction observation. This
network resembled that recently identified in Old World macaque monkeys. Our
findings suggest that this network is largely conserved between New and Old World
primates and support the use of marmosets for studying the neural basis of social
cognition.

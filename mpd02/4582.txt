New cytogenetic techniques in the study of primate genome evolution.

De Stefano GF, Ferrucci L.

Fixed metaphase chromosomes of different species and genera of Primates (five
species of Macaca genus and Callithrix jacchus) have been studied after Alu I
restriction enzyme digestion and DA-DAPI counterstaining, in the attempt to
determine some qualitative characteristics of their DNAs and specifically of the 
DNA localized in the heterochromatic components of the karyotypes. The results
have been discussed in the light of those already published on humans, confirming
the potentiality of this approach in the study of the phyloevolutive
relationships in Primates.

INTRODUCTION: Arboviruses are associated with human disease, and non-human
primates (NHPs) are important primary hosts. This study shows the detection of
antibodies to Oropouche virus (OROV) in NHPs either living in urban parks or
acclimatized at the Wild Animal Screening Center, Goiânia city.
METHODS: Fifty blood samples were analyzed by hemagglutination-inhibition and
neutralization assays.
RESULTS: Two monkeys (Alouatta caraya) had antibodies to OROV by both techniques.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report demonstrating the detection of OROV
antibodies in Goiás State and may represent the introduction/circulation of OROV 
in the region and a potential risk to the human population.

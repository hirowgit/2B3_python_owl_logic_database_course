Networks of widely distributed regions populate human association cortex. One
network, often called the default network, is positioned at the apex of a
gradient of sequential networks that radiate outward from primary cortex. Here,
extensive anatomical data made available through the Marmoset Brain Architecture 
Project are explored to show a homologue exists in marmoset. Results reveal that 
a gradient of networks extend outward from primary cortex to progressively
higher-order transmodal association cortex in both frontal and temporal cortex.
The apex transmodal network comprises frontopolar and rostral temporal
association cortex, parahippocampal areas TH / TF, the ventral posterior midline,
and lateral parietal association cortex. The positioning of this network in the
gradient and its composition of areas make it a candidate homologue to the human 
default network. That the marmoset, a physiologically- and genetically-accessible
primate, might possess a default-network-like candidate creates opportunities for
study of higher cognitive and social functions.

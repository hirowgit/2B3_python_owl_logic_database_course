Aging of human testis and associated cellular changes is difficult to assess.
Therefore, we used a translational, non-human primate model to get insights into 
underlying cellular and biochemical processes. Using proteomics and
immunohistochemistry, we analyzed testicular tissue of young (age 2 to 3) and old
(age 10 to 12) common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus). Using a mass
spectrometry-based proteomics approach, we identified 63,124 peptides, which
could be assigned to 5924 proteins. Among them, we found proteins specific for
germ cells and somatic cells, such as Leydig and Sertoli cells. Quantitative
analysis showed 31 differentially abundant proteins, of which 29 proteins were
more abundant in older animals. An increased abundance of anti-proliferative
proteins, among them CDKN2A, indicate reduced cell proliferation in old testes.
Additionally, an increased abundance of several small leucine rich repeat
proteoglycans and other extracellular matrix proteins was observed, which may be 
related to impaired cell migration and fibrotic events. Furthermore, an increased
abundance of proteins with inhibitory roles in smooth muscle cell contraction
like CNN1 indicates functional alterations in testicular peritubular cells and
may mirror a reduced capacity of these cells to contract in old testes.

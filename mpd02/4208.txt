Seventy-four animals were examined radiographically to determine the skeletal
development of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) from 6 months of age.
Twenty-one epiphyses were examined and five stages of ossification were described
for each. The animals were divided into nine groups, according to age, and a
table of the stage of ossification and age was produced, which may be used for
determining the age of animals of unknown history.

The binding characteristics of the angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonist valsartan 
were investigated in different animal species and tissues. Using
[125I](Sar1,Ile8) angiotensin II as radioligand, affinity constants were
determined in liver and adrenal rat and marmoset, human adrenal and in rat aortic
smooth muscle cells. In all tissues tested, valsartan had a greater affinity for 
the AT1 receptor than losartan (on average 5-fold). The affinities of both
antagonists were up to 30 times weaker in the dog tissues [3H]Valsartan bound
with high affinity (Kd 1.44 nmol/l) to the rat aortic smooth muscle cell AT1
receptor. Binding was saturable and reversible. Non-specific binding was low
(10%). Reports that [3H]losartan binds to a non-angiotensin II binding site in
rat liver and in other tissues could be confirmed. [3H]Valsartan on the other
hand bound only to the AT1 receptor. Using a competition binding assay with
[3H]losartan on rat liver membranes it could be shown that valsartan can bind to 
the 'losartan binding site', but at a 10,000-fold less affinity than for the AT1 
receptor. Valsartan is therefore a highly specific and selective antagonist of
the AT1 receptor. Due to its high affinity and low non-specific binding it is a
suitable radioactive antagonist for the study of the distribution and function of
the angiotensin AT1 receptor.

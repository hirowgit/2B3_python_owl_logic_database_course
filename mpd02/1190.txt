Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is associated with a mortality rate of
>35%. We previously showed that MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) could infect human
macrophages and dendritic cells and induce cytokine dysregulation. Here, we
further investigated the interplay between human primary T cells and MERS-CoV in 
disease pathogenesis. Importantly, our results suggested that MERS-CoV
efficiently infected T cells from the peripheral blood and from human lymphoid
organs, including the spleen and the tonsil. We further demonstrated that
MERS-CoV infection induced apoptosis in T cells, which involved the activation of
both the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathways. Remarkably, immunostaining
of spleen sections from MERS-CoV-infected common marmosets demonstrated the
presence of viral nucleoprotein in their CD3(+) T cells. Overall, our results
suggested that the unusual capacity of MERS-CoV to infect T cells and induce
apoptosis might partly contribute to the high pathogenicity of the virus.

Interconversion between the linear genome of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) present in 
virions and intracellular circular EBV DNA is a novel DNA recombination process. 
A previously characterized DNA binding activity called terminal repeat or tandem 
repeat binding protein (TRBP) was found to recognize several G-rich
recombinogenic sequences in the EBV genome and in cellular DNA. TRBP was also
found to be an autoantigen recognized by sera from certain patients with
undifferentiated connective-tissue disorders. Here the transcription factor Sp1
has been identified as a component of TRBP and has been shown to be an
autoantigen. Sp1 bound to recombination junctions of EBV DNA, such as those in
the terminal repeats and in the large internal repeats, as well as to
recombinogenic regions of cellular DNA, such as variable-number tandem repeats
and switch regions of the immunoglobulin genes. We defined the ends of the linear
EBV genome present in virions and showed that Sp1 binds to the sequence
(GGGGTGGGGCATGGG) within EBV terminal repeats at the precise locus of
interconversion of linear and circular viral DNA. Sp1 may be involved in DNA
recombination.

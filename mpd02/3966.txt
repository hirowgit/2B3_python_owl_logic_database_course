Gummivory or exudate feeding is a major dietary specialization which has received
relatively little attention in the literature. While plant exudates contribute to
the diet of many primate species, we suggest that the callitrichid species
Cebuella pygmaea and Callithrix jacchus are obligate exudate feeders under
free-ranging conditions. Callithrix jacchus provides an excellent model for
examining the effects of exudate feeding and foraging upon social behavior, since
other callitrichid species of similar body size do not share this dietary
specialization. We review the effects of exudate foraging on specific social
behaviors observed both in field and laboratory populations of C. jacchus. By
comparing this species to closely related species, exudate foraging is seen to
(1) be retained under laboratory conditions, (2) increase the frequency of
territorial marking behavior while decreasing the frequency of overt aggression
in males, (3) decrease the duration of infant care, and (4) increase the number
of nonadults in social groups but not affect group size. The evidence presented
supports the hypothesis that the consequences of exudate foraging in C. jacchus
are fundamental and socially complex.

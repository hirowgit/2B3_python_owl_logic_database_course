Density gradient centrifugation is a widely used technique for the separation of 
motile from non-motile sperm, for the removal of contaminating agents such as
bacteria and viruses, and for the removal of seminal plasma or cryoprotectant. In
the choice of a density gradient medium for a new species, it is important to
perform toxicity tests. The present study was carried out to evaluate the
potential toxic effects of two silica-based density gradient products (Percoll
and PureSperm), on the sperm of the common marmoset. We assessed two different
batches of Percoll (polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-coated colloidal silica particles)
and one of PureSperm (saline-coated colloidal silica suspension) by means of a
computer-aided sperm analysis on semen collected by vibrostimulation. The results
showed that although some of the sperm patterns of movement and viability changed
significantly over time, and provide a first description of marmoset sperm
motility changes under capacitating conditions, there was no significant
difference in the sperm treated with Percoll or PureSperm in comparison with the 
control. We conclude that simple exposure to either of these products does not
have a negative effect on viability or motility of marmoset sperm.

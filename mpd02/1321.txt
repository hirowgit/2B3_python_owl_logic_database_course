Progress in the identification of suitable animal models for human herpesvirus
(HHV)-6A and HHV-6B infections has been slow. Recently, new models have been
established, mainly for HHV-6A, which reproduce some pathological features seen
in humans. Neuroinflammatory signs were observed in infected marmosets and
CD46-transgenic mice; although viral replication was not prominent, persistence
of viral DNA and specific immunologic responses were detected, suggesting an
immune-mediated pathogenic mechanism. Pig-tailed macaques showed robust viral
replication concomitant with acute-phase symptoms, and provided a model to study 
the effects of HHV-6A on AIDS progression. In humanized mice, viral replication
was less evident, but infection led to T-cell alterations. Altogether, these
recent developments have opened new perspectives for studying the pathogenic role
of HHV-6A in humans.

The search for experimental (animal) models is essential to the development of
clinical studies.AIM: To demonstrate, by means of micro dissection techniques,
the anatomical structures of temporal bones from the primate Callithrix sp.
STUDY DESIGN: Experimental.
METHODS: Dissection of temporal bone structures of Callithrix sp and photographic
documentation.
RESULTS: We identified the main constituents of the temporal bone (external,
medium and inner ear and facial nerve).
CONCLUSION: The non-human primate Callithrix sp. is an adequate experimental
model for the studies of temporal bone structures given its close anatomical
similarities to that found in humans.

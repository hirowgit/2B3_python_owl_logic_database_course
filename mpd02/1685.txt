The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a species of New World monkeys.
Because of its ease of maintenance and breeding in laboratories, use of the
marmoset is growing rapidly in biomedical research. In neuroscience, the
marmosets are attracting more attention, since they have the developed cerebral
cortex which plays a key role in higher brain functions. In this review on
neuroscience research using the marmoset, experimental techniques developed in
our laboratory are summarized. We introduce artificial rearing of neonates,
stereotaxic surgery, neuroanatomy including virtual microscopy based on the
Internet technology, behavioral study using a large number of marmosets, and
primary neuron culture study.

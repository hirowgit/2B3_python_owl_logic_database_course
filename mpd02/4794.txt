Competition for a desired food in family groups of the common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus) and the cotton-top tamarin (Saguinus oedipus).

Tardif SD, Richter CB.

Four captive groups of common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) and three groups of 
cotton-top tamarins (Saguinus oedipus) were each presented with a desired food
and their consumption was monitored. Inequalities in consumption between
individuals were found for each group of each species. Generally, adult females
consumed most of the desired food, followed by juveniles, and finally adult
males. High consumption levels by all individuals during isolated feedings
indicated that consumption inequalities within groups were most likely due to
competition rather than inter-individual preference differences. Aggressive
defense of the food cup was performed most frequently by adult females in both
species. In Callithrix jacchus groups, this aggression was most often directed
against adult males, but in Saguinus oedipus groups, it was most often directed
against juveniles. Modification of the method of food presentation, such that
food was more dispersed, lessened, but did not eliminate, inequalities in
consumption.

During early postnatal development, males of some primate species exhibit higher 
levels of plasma testosterone than females. The possible significance of this for
behavioural development was examined in male marmosets castrated neonatally (NC),
prepubertally (PC), or in adulthood (AC) and reared in their natal groups.
Age-matched intact (AI) adult males served as controls. All males were removed
from their natal groups as adults for pair testing with unfamiliar conspecific
males and females. NC males did not mount, but were frequently aggressive during 
tests with females. NC males also elicited aggression from females but rarely
from intact males. PC and AC males attempted copulation during the majority of
tests with females; less aggression occurred but more so in tests with PC males
than between females and AC males. Aggression between PC or AC males and intact
males was much more frequent than when NC males met intacts in paired encounters.
Results show that secretion of testicular hormones during infancy in male
marmosets has important effects upon the development of sexual and aggressive
behaviour. Castration in infancy has measurably different effects upon
behavioural development than castration performed later in life (prepubertally or
in adulthood).

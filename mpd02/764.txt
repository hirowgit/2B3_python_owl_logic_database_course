A specific pathogen free (SPF) barrier colony of breeding marmosets (Callithrix
jacchus) was established at the Barshop Institute for Longevity and Aging
Studies. Rodent and other animal models maintained as SPF barrier colonies have
demonstrated improved health and lengthened lifespans enhancing the quality and
repeatability of aging research. The marmosets were screened for two viruses and 
several bacterial pathogens prior to establishing the new SPF colony. Twelve
founding animals successfully established a breeding colony with increased
reproductive success, improved health parameters, and increased median lifespan
when compared to a conventionally housed, open colony. The improved health and
longevity of marmosets from the SPF barrier colony suggests that such management 
can be used to produce a unique resource for future studies of aging processes in
a nonhuman primate model.

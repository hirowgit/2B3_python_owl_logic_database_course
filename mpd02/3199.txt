Cyclin D family members are cellular protooncogenes, and their viral homologues
in the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV, human herpesvirus type 8
[HHV-8]) and the closely related Herpesvirus saimiri have been implicated as
putative cofactors of viral transformation and pathogenesis. KSHV is regularly
found in Kaposi's sarcoma and in the primary effusion B cell lymphoma and
Castleman's disease associated with immunosuppression and AIDS. H. saimiri strain
C488 transforms human and marmoset T cells in vitro and causes polyclonal T cell 
lymphoma in New World monkeys. The viral cyclins stimulate cell cycle progression
of quiescent fibroblasts, and they form active cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)6
complexes of broad substrate specificity that can resist and downregulate
cellular CDK inhibitors. This study shows that the viral cyclin of H. saimiri
strain C488 is not required for viral replication, T cell transformation, and
pathogenicity in New World primates.

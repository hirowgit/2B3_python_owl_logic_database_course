BACKGROUND: Non-human primates can present oral diseases. However, differences
among the dentition of the various species make it difficult to understand their 
dental features and associated diseases. This research hypothesizes that the
prevalence of dental disorders varies in the species studied according to
distinct types of diet.
METHODS: Forty-five syncraniums of the species Alouatta caraya, Alouatta guariba 
clamitans, Sapajus nigritus, Callithrix jacchus, and Callithrix penicillata were 
evaluated by visual inspection, magnifying glasses, and on cone-beam computed
tomography.
RESULTS: Disorders identified consisted of missing teeth before death, agenesis, 
dental calculus, dental wear, dental staining, dental fracture, exposure of pulp 
chamber, alveolar bone resorption, tooth discoloration, and persistence of
deciduous teeth. Alouatta guariba clamitans presented the most disorders.
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that neotropical primates have a high prevalence
of dental changes, even in free-living conditions, and that the differences
observed among them may be associated with different diet patterns.

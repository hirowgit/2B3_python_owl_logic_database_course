The mating system of callitrichids has been reported to be monogamous, polygynous
and polyandrous. In Callithrix jacchus, groups with 2 breeding females and groups
with 1 breeding female have been reported. Our purpose was to evaluate the
occurrence of occasional reproduction by subordinate females in free-ranging C.
jacchus groups characterized as monogamous. Four groups were monitored at a field
site of IBAMA-Brazil for between 20 and 72 months. We recorded the birth of 7
sets of twins to subordinate females that had never reproduced before. Sexual
activities were recorded opportunistically: dominant females copulated with only 
the resident male, while subordinates copulated with extra-group males. We
suggest these were essentially monogamous groups that occasionally had 2
reproductive females. Between-group copulations seem to be an alternative
strategy used by the subordinates. Despite the costs, there would probably be
benefits as a result of scanning for vacancies for reproductive positions in
neighbouring groups and the establishment of ties with extra-group males that
might become a reproductive partner in the future.

The magnitude of the 2013-2016 Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic enabled an
unprecedented number of viral mutations to occur over successive human-to-human
transmission events, increasing the probability that adaptation to the human host
occurred during the outbreak. We investigated one nonsynonymous mutation, Ebola
virus (EBOV) glycoprotein (GP) mutant A82V, for its effect on viral infectivity. 
This mutation, located at the NPC1-binding site on EBOV GP, occurred early in the
2013-2016 outbreak and rose to high frequency. We found that GP-A82V had
heightened ability to infect primate cells, including human dendritic cells. The 
increased infectivity was restricted to cells that have primate-specific NPC1
sequences at the EBOV interface, suggesting that this mutation was indeed an
adaptation to the human host. GP-A82V was associated with increased mortality,
consistent with the hypothesis that the heightened intrinsic infectivity of
GP-A82V contributed to disease severity during the EVD epidemic.

BACKGROUND: It remains unknown how single-shot anesthesia influences physical
parameters, especially respiratory function and blood oxygen level of common
marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) which came to be used for laboratory research.
METHODS: We measured blood oxygen levels, both before and after oxygenation, in
13 common marmosets under two single-shot anesthesia conditions:
ketamine/xylazine/atropine and alphaxalone.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: We found that SpO2 values decreased to about 80% in the 
ketamine/xylazine/atropine protocol and fell just below 90% in the alphaxalone
protocol. We observed a clear decrease in PaO2 values under the anesthetized
condition compared to the awake condition. Our data indicate that single-shot
anesthesia may cause hypoxemia in marmosets. Previous studies on other non-human 
primate have reported no SpO2 decrease and hypoxemia; thus, our experiment
suggests that marmosets may have a more fragile respiratory system and require
intensive veterinary care during anesthesia.

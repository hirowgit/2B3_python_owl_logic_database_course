Cholinergic learning deficits in the marmoset produced by scopolamine and ICV
hemicholinium.

Ridley RM, Barratt NG, Baker HF.

Common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) were trained to perform daily position
discrimination learning tasks in a Wisconsin General Test Apparatus.
Acetylcholine receptor blockade with scopolamine was found to impair position
learning. Testing on the day after scopolamine treatment suggested that a task
learnt under scopolamine was not encoded into long term memory. Acetylcholine
depletion achieved by the intraventricular injection of hemicholinium 4 h before 
testing resulted in a profound impairment of position discrimination learning. It
is suggested that central acetylcholine depletion in primates may provide a
useful model of senile dementia.

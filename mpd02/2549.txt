To develop a new live attenuated mumps vaccine, a wild mumps Y7 strain isolated
from a patient who developed mild parotitis was treated with nitrosoguanidine and
ultraviolet, followed by selection of a temperature-sensitive clone. The selected
clone, Y125, showed stable temperature-sensitivity in Vero cells. Intraspinal
inoculation of marmosets with the Y125 produced only minimal histopathological
changes, while intracerebral inoculation of neonatal rats revealed that the Y125 
did not cause hydrocephalus. Both these effects of the Y125 were similar to those
of the non-neurovirulent Jeryl Lynn strain. Furthermore, subcutaneous inoculation
of the Y125 induced high levels of neutralizing antibodies in all Cercopithecus
monkeys examined. Although the safety and immunogenicity should be confirmed in
further field trials in humans, the present results indicate that the Y125 could 
be a promising vaccine candidate.

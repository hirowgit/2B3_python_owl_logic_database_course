Resistant populations of the Bacteroides fragilis group bacteria (two reference
ones and two isolated from human and Callithrix penicillata marmoset) were
obtained by the gradient plate technique, to clindamycin, penicillin G,
metronidazole and mercuric chloride. All the four tested strains were originally 
susceptible to the four antimicrobial drugs at the breakpoint used in this study.
MICs determination for the four cultures gave constant values for each
antimicrobial, on the several steps by the gradient plate technique. The
intestinal human B. fragilis strains showed three DNA bands, that could be
representative of only two plasmids in the closed covalently circular (CCC) form 
with molecular weights of approximately 25 and 2.5 Md. The results do not permit 
an association between the presence of plasmid in the human strain with the
susceptibility to the studied drugs. The four strains were beta-lactamase
negative in the two methods used, and no particular chromosomal genetic
resistance marker was demonstrated. The resistance (MIC) observed, after contact 
with penicillin G and mercuric chloride, were two-fold in the four tested
strains.

The eyes absent (EYA)-like genes are essential for the formation of sensory
organs among fly (Drosophila melanogaster) and mammals. EYA4, one of the
vertebrate genes of Eya family, is reported to be causative for late-onset
mid-frequency sensorineural hearing loss in humans, while Eya4-deficient mice
exhibited congenital profound deafness and otitis media with effusion due to the 
eustachian tube dysmorphology. Because of the species difference in the
phenotype, the pathophysiology of EYA4 in the human cochlea has yet to be
elucidated. Here, we examine the expression pattern of EYA4 in the cochlea of
common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a non-human primate. The results indicated 
a distinct expression pattern of EYA4 in the adult marmoset cochleae, especially 
strong in all supporting cells, while in mouse their expressions were diminished.
Interestingly, EYA4 expression in the hair cells, supporting cells and neurons
was co-localized with sine oculis homeobox-SIX1, a transcription factor essential
for the transcriptional activity of EYA4. The results revealed inter-species
differences in the expression pattern of EYA4 gene in supporting cells between
primates and rodents. The results also indicated a fundamental role of EYA4 in
the primate auditory cells. Experiments with primate models such as marmosets or 
with human cochlear cells may provide cues about the unknown pathogenesis of
EYA4-related hearing loss.

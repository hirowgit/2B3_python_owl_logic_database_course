Topographically organized reciprocal connections between areas 17 and MT (visual 
area of superior temporal sulcus) in the marmoset Callithrix jacchus.

Spatz WB.

With the aid of the techniques of tracing axonal pathways by anterograde fiber
degeneration, and by anterograde (autoradiography) and retrograde
(HRP-histochemistry) axoplasmic transport, it could be shown that area 17
projects in a topographically and visuotopically organized manner onto the
temporal visual area MT. The fibers of this association system originate from
pyramidal cells in layer IIIc, and from the solitary cells of Meynert; they
terminate in layers IV and III of area MT. A correspondingly organized system of 
countercurrent fibers originates from pyramidal cells in layers III/II and V/VI
of area MT and terminates separately in layers VI, IIIc and I of area 17.

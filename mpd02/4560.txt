A backpack system for long-term osmotic minipump infusions into unrestrained
marmoset monkeys.

Ruiz de Elvira MC, Abbott DH.

A backpack system is described whereby osmotic minipumps are used to infuse
gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) subcutaneously in a pulsatile manner into 
infertile socially subordinate female marmoset monkeys (Callithrix jacchus
jacchus). This procedure enables long-term infusion of GnRH without the necessity
of repeated subcutaneous implantation of pumps and GnRH reservoirs. The backpack 
and cannulae system is inexpensive and can be constructed from commonly available
materials. The GnRH treatment successfully overcame the suppression of pituitary 
luteinizing hormone secretion imposed by the low social status of female marmoset
monkeys.

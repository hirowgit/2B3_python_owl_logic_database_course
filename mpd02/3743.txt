Heteroduplex mobility assays (HMAs) of a cytochrome b region were used for
estimating genetic distances and phylogenetic relationships between some selected
neotropical primates of the families Callitrichidae (marmosets and tamarins) and 
Cebidae [capuchin monkey, (Cebus apella)], and man (Homo sapiens). HMA distances 
were found to be strongly correlated to analogous estimates derived from DNA
sequence data. Phylogenetic trees obtained by HMAs and sequence analyses showed
similar topologies with almost identical intraspecific, intrageneric, and
intergeneric relationships. The applicability of HMAs is assessed relative to
different levels of molecular and organismal diversity.

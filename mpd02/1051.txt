BACKGROUND: The increasing life span of Callithrix jacchus in combination with
the occurrence of metabolic and age-dependent diseases requires improved health
surveillance for this species.
METHODS: The health status of 56 marmosets was studied using a non-invasive blood
pressure (BP) device. Age-, weight-, and sex-dependent changes were analyzed.
Four animals with striking BP findings had follow-up exams.
RESULTS: Physiological and pathological BP values could be defined. BP positively
correlated with age and weight, while no effect of sex could be found.
Measurement time for female and older animals was shorter than for male and
younger individuals. Further analysis of the suspicious patients revealed renal
or hepatic diseases and cardiac alterations.
CONCLUSION: The description of age and weight influences on BP delivers
physiological and pathological values for common marmosets. This may contribute
to the understanding of aging process and cardiology in this primate species.

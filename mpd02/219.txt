After the sudden death of captive marmosets in São Paulo, Brazil, we conducted a 
histologic and microbiologic study. We found hyperacute septicemia caused by
hypermucoviscous sequence type 86 K2 Klebsiella pneumoniae. We implemented
prophylactic antimicrobial therapy, selected dedicated staff for marmoset
interactions, and sanitized the animals' fruit to successfully control this
outbreak.

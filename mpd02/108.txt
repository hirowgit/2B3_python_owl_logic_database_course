Marmosets are an increasingly important model system for neuroscience in part due
to genetic tractability and enhanced cortical accessibility, due to a
lissencephalic neocortex. However, many of the techniques generally employed to
record neural activity in primates inhibit the expression of natural behaviors in
marmosets precluding neurophysiological insights. To address this challenge, we
have developed methods for recording neural population activity in unrestrained
marmosets across multiple ethological behaviors, multiple brain states, and over 
multiple years. Notably, our flexible methodological design allows for replacing 
electrode arrays and removal of implants providing alternative experimental
endpoints. We validate the method by recording sensorimotor cortical population
activity in freely moving marmosets across their natural behavioral repertoire
and during sleep.

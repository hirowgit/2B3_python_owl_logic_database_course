A fundamental dichotomy in the subcortical visual system exists between on- and
off-type neurons, which respectively signal increases and decreases of light
intensity in the visual environment. In primates, signals for red-green color
vision are carried by both on- and off-type neurons in the parvocellular division
of the subcortical pathway. It is thought that on-type signals for blue-yellow
color vision are carried by cells in a distinct, diffusely projecting
(koniocellular) pathway, but the pathway taken by blue-off signals is not known. 
Here, we measured blue-off responses in the subcortical visual pathway of
marmoset monkeys. We found that the cells exhibiting blue-off responses are
largely segregated to the koniocellular pathway. The blue-off cells show
relatively large receptive fields, sluggish responses to maintained contrast,
little sign of an inhibitory receptive-field surround mechanism, and negligible
functional input from an intrinsic (melanopsin-based) phototransductive
mechanism. These properties are consistent with input from koniocellular or
"W-like" ganglion cells in the retina and suggest that blue-off cells, as
previously shown for blue-on cells, could contribute to cortical mechanisms for
visual perception via the koniocellular pathway.

The development of Fasciola hepatica from two species of definitive hosts, i.e.
cattle (Bos taurus) and a marmoset (Callithrix penicillata) in the snail Lymnaea 
columella was determined based on the production of rediae and cercariae and
snail survival rate. More rediae and cercariae at 60-74 days post-infection were 
produced by snails infected by cattle-derived miracidia (cattle group) than by
those infected by marmoset-derived miracidia (marmoset group). Among the L.
columella parasitized by the marmoset group, the survival rate and the percentage
of positive snails were higher than among those parasitized by the cattle group. 
Eggs of F. hepatica released in cattle faeces were significantly bigger than
those released in marmoset faeces. Miracidia originating from parasites that
completed their development in cattle were more efficient in infecting the
intermediate host. These results suggest that vertebrate-host origin influences
the eggs produced by the parasite and the infection rates in the snail host L.
columella.

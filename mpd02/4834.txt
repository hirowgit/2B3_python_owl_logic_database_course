Pregnancy diagnosis in the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus jacchus).

Lunn SF, Hobson BM, Hearn JP.

Abdominal palpation of the uterus was carried out on 25 pregnant and 29
non-pregnant marmosets (Callithrix jacchus jacchus). 195 complete 24-hour urine
specimens, collected between the first week of gestation and term (21 weeks),
were tested with the Sub-Human Primate Tube (SHPT) test. No significant
differences between the two methods in their ability to diagnose pregnancy were
obtained between the first and 13th week of gestation. The SHPT test was seldom
positive after the 13th week of pregnancy, whereas, with one exception, palpation
always indicated pregnancy.

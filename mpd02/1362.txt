In this study, we investigated the reciprocal exchanges of grooming, tolerance
and reduced aggression in common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus), a cooperatively 
breeding primate whose groups are typically characterized by uniformly high
genetic relatedness and high interdependency between group members. Both partner 
control and partner choice processes played a role in the reciprocal exchanges of
grooming. In contrast, we did not find any evidence of reciprocity between
grooming and tolerance over a preferred food source or between grooming and
reduced aggression. Thus, reciprocity seems to play a variable role in the
exchange of cooperative behaviors in marmosets.

The stereospecific form of the known acetylenic mechanism-based MAO-inhibitor
AGN1135 (Rasagiline, TVP-1012) is devoid of sympathomimetic amphetamine-like
properties. To evaluate the efficiency and selectivity of subcutaneous injections
of TVP-1012 (dose range from 0.01 up to 10 mg/kg for 7 days) the activities of
monoamine oxidases A and B (MAO-A,-B) were determined in different brain regions 
of the common marmoset. At a dose of 0.1 mg/kg TVP-1012, almost 80% of MAO-B
activity is inhibited in all brain regions investigated (prefrontal and occipital
cortex, cerebellum, caudate nucleus, putamen, nucleus accumbens). In contrast,
MAO-A is not inhibited in putamen and nucleus accumbens. However, by increasing
the TVP-1012 dose to 0.5 mg/kg, MAO-A is inhibited to a significant extent as
well, concomitant to total inhibition of MAO-B. The results obtained indicate
that TVP-1012 irreversibly inhibits both types of MAO in the common marmoset with
selectivity for MAO-B at doses less than 0.5 mg/kg. TVP-1012 could be useful in
studies requiring selective MAO-B inhibition without concomitant sympathomimetic 
amphetamine-like effects and could thus be of therapeutic interest for
Parkinson's disease and retarded depression.

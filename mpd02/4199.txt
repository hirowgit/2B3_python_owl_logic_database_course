The published knowledge on neurobiological, psychological, and ethological
aspects of development in Callithrix jacchus is still limited. We have collected 
published and unpublished data from several Callithrix colonies and pooled
information on criteria for developmental progress and maturation using a
questionnaire sent to numerous experts in the field. The data suggest that
developmental stages can be defined not only for the embryonic and fetal but also
for the postnatal period. Based on multifactorial definitions, using criteria
selected from maturational changes in the motor and visual systems and behavioral
features, we propose to subdivide postnatal development of the common marmoset
into seven periods ("stages").

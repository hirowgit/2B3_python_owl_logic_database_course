Genetically modified mice have contributed much to studies in the life sciences. 
In some research fields, however, mouse models are insufficient for analyzing the
molecular mechanisms of pathology or as disease models. Often, genetically
modified non-human primate (NHP) models are desired, as they are more similar to 
human physiology, morphology, and anatomy. Recent progress in studies of the
reproductive biology in NHPs has enabled the introduction of exogenous genes into
NHP genomes or the alteration of endogenous NHP genes. This review summarizes
recent progress in the production of genetically modified NHPs, including the
common marmoset, and future perspectives for realizing genetically modified NHP
models for use in life sciences research.

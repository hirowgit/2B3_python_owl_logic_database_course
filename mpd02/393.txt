The extent to which vocal learning can be found in nonhuman primates is key to
reconstructing the evolution of speech. Regarding the adjustment of vocal output 
in relation to auditory experience (vocal production learning in the narrow
sense), effects on the ontogenetic trajectory of vocal development as well as
adjustment to group-specific call features have been found. Yet, a comparison of 
the vocalizations of different primate genera revealed striking similarities in
the structure of calls and repertoires in different species of the same genus,
indicating that the structure of nonhuman primate vocalizations is highly
conserved. Thus, modifications in relation to experience only appear to be
possible within relatively tight species-specific constraints. By contrast,
comprehension learning may be extremely rapid and open-ended. In conjunction,
these findings corroborate the idea of an ancestral independence of vocal
production and auditory comprehension learning. To overcome the futile debate
about whether or not vocal production learning can be found in nonhuman primates,
we suggest putting the focus on the different mechanisms that may mediate the
adjustment of vocal output in response to experience; these mechanisms may
include auditory facilitation and learning from success. This article is part of 
the theme issue 'What can animal communication teach us about human language?'

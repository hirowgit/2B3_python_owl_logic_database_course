X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) is the epigenetic transcriptional silencing of an
X-chromosome during the early stages of embryonic development in female eutherian
mammals. XCI assures monoallelic expression in each cell and compensation for
dosage-sensitive X-linked genes between females (XX) and males (XY). DNA
methylation at the carbon-5 position of the cytosine pyrimidine ring in the
context of a CpG dinucleotide sequence (5meCpG) in promoter regions is a key
epigenetic marker for transcriptional gene silencing. Using computational
analysis, we revealed an extragenic tandem GAAA repeat 230-bp from the landmark
CpG island of the human X-linked retinitis pigmentosa 2 RP2 promoter whose 5meCpG
status correlates with XCI. We used this RP2 onshore tandem GAAA repeat to
develop an allele-specific 5meCpG-based PCR assay that is highly concordant with 
the human androgen receptor (AR) exonic tandem CAG repeat-based standard HUMARA
assay in discriminating active (Xa) from inactive (Xi) X-chromosomes. The RP2
onshore tandem GAAA repeat contains neutral features that are lacking in the AR
disease-linked tandem CAG repeat, is highly polymorphic (heterozygosity rates
approximately 0.8) and shows minimal variation in the Xa/Xi ratio. The combined
informativeness of RP2/AR is approximately 0.97, and this assay excels at
determining the 5meCpG status of alleles at the Xp (RP2) and Xq (AR) chromosome
arms in a single reaction. These findings are relevant and directly translatable 
to nonhuman primate models of XCI in which the AR CAG-repeat is monomorphic. We
conducted the RP2 onshore tandem GAAA repeat assay in the naturally occurring
chimeric New World monkey marmoset (Callitrichidae) and found it to be
informative. The RP2 onshore tandem GAAA repeat will facilitate studies on the
variable phenotypic expression of dominant and recessive X-linked diseases,
epigenetic changes in twins, the physiology of aging hematopoiesis, the
pathogenesis of age-related hematopoietic malignancies and the clonality of
cancers in human and nonhuman primates.

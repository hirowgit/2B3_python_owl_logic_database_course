PURPOSE: We evaluated the effect of imposing negative and positive defocus
simultaneously on the eye growth and refractive state of the common marmoset, a
New World primate that compensates for either negative and positive defocus when 
they are imposed individually.
METHODS: Ten marmosets were reared with multizone contact lenses of alternating
powers (-5 diopters [D]/+5 D), 50:50 ratio for average pupil of 2.80 mm over the 
right eye (experimental) and plano over the fellow eye (control) from 10 to 12
weeks. The effects on refraction (mean spherical equivalent [MSE]) and vitreous
chamber depth (VC) were measured and compared to untreated, and -5 D and +5 D
single vision contact lens-reared marmosets.
RESULTS: Over the course of the treatment, pupil diameters ranged from 2.26 to
2.76 mm, leading to 1.5 times greater exposure to negative than positive power
zones. Despite this, at different intervals during treatment, treated eyes were
on average relatively more hyperopic and smaller than controls
(experimental-control [exp-con] mean MSE ± SE +1.44 ± 0.45 D, mean VC ± SE -0.05 
± 0.02 mm) and the effects were similar to those in marmosets raised on +5 D
single vision contact lenses (exp-con mean MSE ± SE +1.62 ± 0.44 D. mean VC ± SE 
-0.06 ± 0.03 mm). Six weeks into treatment, the interocular growth rates in
multizone animals were already lower than in -5 D-treated animals (multizone -1.0
± 0.1 μm/day, -5 D +2.1 ± 0.9 μm/day) and did not change significantly throughout
treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Imposing hyperopic and myopic defocus simultaneously using
concentric contact lenses resulted in relatively smaller and less myopic eyes,
despite treated eyes being exposed to a greater percentage of negative defocus.
Exposing the retina to combined dioptric powers with multifocal lenses that
include positive defocus might be an effective treatment to control myopia
development or progression.

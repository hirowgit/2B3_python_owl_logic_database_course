The first weeks of cohabitation of newly-formed heterosexual pairs of common
marmosets (Callithrix jacchus).

Woodcock AJ.

16 pairs of common marmosets were formed, six of which were observed for 7 weeks,
and ten for 4 weeks. A variety of behaviours was recorded, including sexual
mounting, male tongue-smacking, female slit-eyed tongue-flicking, scent marks,
huddling, allogrooming and autogrooming. Behaviours associated with sexual
encounters occurred initially at high levels but declined during the study
period. The incidence of sexual mounting was closely related to that of male
tongue-smacking and female slit-eyed tongue-flicking. Other social behaviours
including scent-marking and allogrooming did not show a consistent pattern of
occurrence with respect to time or sexual activity.

To assess the pattern of infant carrying across time and family members, we
counted which animals in 13 well-established family groups of captive-bred
marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) carried neonates during the first 8 weeks of life.
The neonates were carried almost continuously for the first 3 weeks and then
spent progressively more time independently. The mother did most of the carrying 
for the first 2 weeks, her contribution rising from day 1 to day 3 and declining 
thereafter. The contribution of the father was high on day 1, declined during the
first week, and then rose to a peak in the fourth week. The contribution of the
siblings rose sharply during the first week and declined thereafter. There was no
overall difference in amount of infant carrying by each parent. The contribution 
of each sibling was small although in these large families the total contribution
by siblings was large. These data may differ from previous observations because
the breeding pairs were very well established, the families were large, and all
except the youngest animals were very experienced in rearing and carrying. These 
data emphasise the group-dynamic nature of infant carrying in a primate species.

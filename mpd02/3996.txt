The "normal" mesangium of callitrichids exhibits certain features pointing to
enhanced activity. Protrusions of the mesangial cellular cytoplasm (blebs) into
the capillary lumen were observed very frequently as were electron-dense granules
in mesangial matrix channels. Histochemical, alpha-actin expression was
invariably observed in the mesangial cells of callitrichids.

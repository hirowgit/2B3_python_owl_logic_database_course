In this paper, we discuss issues concerning the welfare of non-human primates
used in laboratory research from an eco-ethological standpoint and suggest means 
of improving welfare. Following a brief review of the use of non-human primates
in European countries and of the legislation that governs this use, we illustrate
how a thorough eco-ethological knowledge of the species being studied can play a 
vital role in improving both its conditions and the quality of the experimental
protocols, arguing that the animal's quality of life is closely linked to the
quality of data. As a model for describing environmental enrichment techniques,
we have used the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).

In this study we determined the mechanical output of common marmosets (Callithrix
jacchus) during jumping. Vertical ground reaction forces were measured in 18
animals while they jumped from an instrumented crossbar to a crossbar located 70 
cm higher. From the vertical force time histories, we calculated the rate of
change of mechanical energy of the centre of mass (dE/dt). The mean value of
dE/dt during the push-off amounted to 51.8±6.2 W kg(-1) body mass, and the peak
value to 116.4±17.6 W kg(-1) body mass. We used these values in combination with 
masses of leg muscles, determined in two specimens, to estimate mean and peak
values of dE/dt of 430 and 970 W kg(-1) muscle, respectively. These values are
higher than values reported in the literature for jumps of humans and bonobos,
but smaller than those of jumps of bushbabies. Surprisingly, the mean value of
dE/dt of 430 W kg(-1) muscle was close to the maximal power output of 516 W
kg(-1) muscle reported in the literature for isokinetic contractions of rat
medial gastrocnemius, one of the fastest mammalian muscles. Further study of the 
force-velocity relationship of muscle tissue of small primates is indicated.

Two GB virus B (GBV-B) chimeric genomes, GBV-HVR and GBV-HVRh (with a hinge),
containing the coding region of the immunodominant hypervariable region 1 (HVR1) 
of the E2 envelope protein of Hepatitis C virus (HCV) were constructed.
Immunoblot analysis confirmed that HVR1 was anchored to the GBV-B E2 protein. To 
investigate the replication competence and in vivo stability of in
vitro-generated chimeric RNA transcripts, two naïve marmosets were inoculated
intrahepatically with the transcripts. The GBV-HVR chimeric genome was detectable
for 2 weeks post-inoculation (p.i.), whereas GBV-HVRh reverted to wild type 1
week p.i. Sequencing analysis of the HVR1 and flanking regions from GBV-HVR RNA
isolated from marmoset serum demonstrated that the HVR1 insert remained unaltered
in the GBV-HVR chimera for 2 weeks. Inoculation of a naïve marmoset with serum
collected at 1 week p.i. also resulted in viraemia and confirmed that the serum
contained infectious particles. All animals cleared the infection by 3 weeks p.i.
and remained negative for the remaining weeks. The chimera may prove useful for
the in vivo examination of any HCV HVR1-based vaccine candidates.

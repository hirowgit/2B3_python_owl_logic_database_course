RATIONALE: Growing evidence suggests that dopamine D4 receptors (D4Rs) are
involved in controlling executive functions. We have previously demonstrated that
Ro 10-5824, a D4R partial agonist, improves the performance of common marmosets
in the object retrieval detour (ORD) task. However, the neural mechanisms
underlying this improvement are unknown.
OBJECTIVES: We investigated the behavioral and neurophysiological effects of Ro
10-5824 in common marmosets.
METHODS: The effects of Ro 10-5824 on cognitive function were evaluated using the
ORD task. The neurophysiological effects of Ro 10-5824 were investigated by
quantitative electroencephalography, especially on baseline gamma band activity
in the frontal cortex. The effects of Ro 10-5824 on spontaneous locomotion were
also assessed.
RESULTS: Systemic administration of Ro 10-5824 at 3 mg/kg significantly increased
the success rate in the ORD task. At doses of 1 and 3 mg/kg, Ro 10-5824 increased
baseline gamma band activity in the frontal cortex. Ro 10-5824 had no effect on
spontaneous locomotion.
CONCLUSIONS: Activation of D4R by Ro 10-5824 improves the success rate in the ORD
task and increases baseline gamma band activity in the frontal cortex without
affecting locomotion in common marmosets. These findings highlight the role of
D4R in gamma oscillations of non-human primates. As gamma oscillations are
thought to be involved in attention and behavioral inhibition, our results
suggest D4R agonists may improve these cognitive functions by modulating baseline
gamma band activity in the frontal cortex.

Induced pluripotent stem cells from nonhuman primates (NHPs) have unique roles in
cell biology and regenerative medicine. Because of the relatedness of NHPs to
humans, NHP iPS cells can serve as a source of differentiated derivatives that
can be used to address important questions in the comparative biology of
primates. Additionally, when used as a source of cells for regenerative medicine,
NHP iPS cells serve an invaluable role in translational experiments in cell
therapy. Reprogramming of NHP somatic cells requires the same conditions as
previously established for human cells. However, throughout the process, a
variety of modifications to the human cell protocols must be made to accommodate 
significant species differences.

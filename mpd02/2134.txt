GBV-B induces hepatitis in tamarins and marmosets and is a surrogate model for
HCV infections. Here, we cloned and characterized the antiviral activity of
tamarin and marmoset interferon (IFN)alpha and IFN gamma. Potent antiviral
activity was observed for tamarin and marmoset IFN alpha in primary hepatocyte
cultures infected with GBV-B. The antiviral activity was greater in cultures
exposed to IFN alpha prior to GBV-B infection, suggesting that either GBV-B was
capable of inhibition of the antiviral activity of exogenous IFN alpha or that
the preexisting endogenous IFN response to the virus reduced efficacy to
exogenous IFN alpha. IFN gamma also exhibited antiviral activity in GBV-B
infected hepatocytes. The transcriptional response to IFN alpha in marmoset
hepatocytes was characterized using human genome microarrays. Since the GBV-B
hepatocyte culture model possesses a functional innate immune response, it will
provide opportunities to explore the nature of the antiviral response to a virus 
closely related to HCV.

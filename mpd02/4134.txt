Endothelin receptors (ETRs) are distributed throughout a variety of tissues. Two 
human cDNAs were identified which encode distinct ETR proteins. One cDNA encoded 
a 427-amino acid protein that shared 91% identity to rat ETAR. The second cDNA
encoded a 442-amino acid protein that was 88% identical to rat ETBR. Ligand
binding studies of the cloned receptors expressed in COS cells confirmed that
they were pharmacologically ETAR and ETBR subtypes; although the selective
antagonist BQ123 showed a potency similar to ET-3 in displacing 125I-ET-1 binding
to ETAR. This observation contrasts with rat ETAR pharmacology where BQ123 has a 
100-fold higher affinity than ET3. Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing the
human ETAR displayed equal potencies in displacing 125I-ET-1 binding, which
indicates that rat and human ETAR are pharmacologically distinct.
Electrophysiological studies of both ETRs expressed in Xenopus oocytes revealed
that they are functional. Northern analysis indicated that the two ETRs are
differentially expressed in many tissues. Marmosets maintained on a high fat/high
cholesterol diet exhibited 3-fold increase in ETBR mRNA levels with little change
in ETAR mRNA levels. Availability of cDNA clones for ETR subtypes can open
avenues for future analysis of their role in pathophysiology of various diseases.

A 20-year retrospective study was carried out to determine the prevalence of
diseases occurring in 265 (155 males and 110 females) common marmosets
(Callithrix jacchus), kept at the São Paulo Zoo. A total of 564 clinical
disorders were detected: digestive problems, 50.2% (protozoa, 44.3%; helminths,
26.3%; bacteria, 7.0%; non-especific causes, 22.4%); respiratory problems
(pneumonia), 16.3%; injuries, 13.8%; nutritional deficiency, 4.4%; reproductive
problems (obstetrical) 2.5%; septicemia, 1.6%; circulatory problems, 1.6%;
sporadic cases, 4.0%; inconclusive cases, 5.5%. Little attention has been paid to
the sanitary care of marmosets in Brazil. Since most of the available information
comes from the international literature, the occurrence of major diseases and
their etiological agents in Brazil are relevant data.

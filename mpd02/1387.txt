The suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) are pointed to as the mammals central circadian 
pacemaker. Aged animals show internal time disruption possibly caused by
morphological and neurochemical changes in SCN components. Some studies reported 
changes of neuronal cells and neuroglia in the SCN of rats and nonhuman primates 
during aging. The effects of senescence on morphological aspects in SCN are
important for understanding some alterations in biological rhythms expression.
Therefore, our aim was to perform a comparative study of the morphological
aspects of SCN in adult and aged female marmoset. Morphometric analysis of SCN
was performed using Nissl staining, NeuN-IR, GFAP-IR, and CB-IR. A significant
decrease in the SCN cells staining with Nissl, NeuN, and CB were observed in aged
female marmosets compared to adults, while a significant increase in glial cells 
was found in aged marmosets, thus suggesting compensatory process due to neuronal
loss evoked by aging.

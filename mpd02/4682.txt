Genetic polymorphism and linkage of the sixth and seventh complement components
(C6 and C7) in the common marmoset.

Whitehouse DB.

Using polyacrylamide gel isoelectric focusing and standard specific hemolytic
detection methods, genetic polymorphisms have been found in the sixth and seventh
complement components (C6 and C7) in two laboratory groups of Common marmosets.
The C6 locus is highly variable and the products of six alleles were observed;
three C7 alleles were found. Comprehensive breeding data indicated that both sets
of alleles are inherited in an autosomal codominant manner. Many of the C6
variants differed only by a minute charge interval. The C7 variant bands differed
by large charge intervals and could only be clearly seen in plasmas that had been
preincubated with neuraminidase. A linkage analysis of C6 and C7 phenotypes in
three, two-generation families gives reasonable evidence that the two loci are
linked in marmosets as they are in humans.

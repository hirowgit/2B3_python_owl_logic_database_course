Regions of DNA homology between human and marmoset (Callithrix jacchus)
chromosomes have been demonstrated using fluorescence in situ hybridization. All 
24 chromosome paints and two centromere repeat sequences from Homo sapiens (HSA) 
have been annealed to previously G-banded metaphase spreads of Callithrix
jacchus. All human paint probes, except Y, successfully hybridized to marmoset
chromosomes. Fifteen of them hybridized to one region only, seven to two regions,
and paint 1 to three regions. Homologies proposed from previous banding
comparisons have been confirmed for HSA 2, 4-6, 10-12, 18, 19, 21 and X and
partially confirmed for HSA 1 and 3, but were not in agreement for HSA 14 and 17.
Human centromere repeat sequences for X and 18 did not hybridize to marmoset
chromosomes. Because, at present, there is the confusion situation of several
different numbering systems for marmoset chromosomes, we propose a new simpler
nomenclature based on descending order of chromosome size.

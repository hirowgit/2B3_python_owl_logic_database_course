Transplacental and direct exposure of mouse and marmoset to ethylnitrosourea:
analysis of chromosome aberrations.

Theiss I, Basler A, RÃ¶hrborn G.

The effect of ethylnitrosourea (ENU) on chromosomes of mouse bone marrow cells
and transplacentally exposed embryonic liver cells was investigated. Chromosome
aberrations were found to be dose- and time-dependent. The maximum damage was
seen 6 h after the exposure. Chromosome aberrations were also induced in bone
marrow cells and lymphocytes of marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) directly exposed
to ENU. Aberrations did not, however, occur in offspring whose mothers were
treated with ENU before conception. Furthermore, chronic transplacentally exposed
offspring have been analyzed. The frequency of chromosome aberrations was not
increased in their lymphocytes and fibroblasts. The elimination of chromosome
aberrations during embryogenesis is discussed.

Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are capable of providing an unlimited
source of cells from all three germ layers and germ cells. The derivation and
usage of iPSCs from various animal models may facilitate stem cell-based therapy,
gene-modified animal production, and evolutionary studies assessing interspecies 
differences. However, there is a lack of species-wide methods for deriving iPSCs,
in particular by means of non-viral and non-transgene-integrating (NTI)
approaches. Here, we demonstrate the iPSC derivation from somatic fibroblasts of 
multiple mammalian species from three different taxonomic orders, including the
common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) in Primates, the dog (Canis lupus
familiaris) in Carnivora, and the pig (Sus scrofa) in Cetartiodactyla, by
combinatorial usage of chemical compounds and NTI episomal vectors.
Interestingly, the fibroblasts temporarily acquired a neural stem cell-like state
during the reprogramming. Collectively, our method, robustly applicable to
various species, holds a great potential for facilitating stem cell-based
research using various animals in Mammalia.

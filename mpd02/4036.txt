The design, synthesis and structure-activity relationships of transition-state
inhibitors containing the dihydroxyethylene isostere at the scissile site are
described. The compounds with
(2S,3R,4S)-4-amino-5-cyclohexyl-1-morpholino-2,3-pentanediol at the P1-P1 site
are potent renin inhibitors.
(2S,3R,4S)-4-[N-[(2S)-3-Ethylsulfonyl-2-(1-naphthylmethyl)propiony l]-L-
norleucyl]amino-5-cyclohexyl-1-morpholino-2,3-pentanediol (2) (BW-175), which is 
the most potent inhibitor (IC50: 3.3 nM against human renin) in this series,
poorly inhibits cathepsin D (IC50: 26000 nM) and pepsin (IC50: > 100000 nM), and 
thus it is specific for renin. Compound 2 contains only one amino acid and showed
an oral bioavailability of 2.8% at 10 mg/kg and 9.7% at 30 mg/kg in rats. The
interaction between renin and inhibitor 2 is discussed on the basis of molecular 
modeling studies.

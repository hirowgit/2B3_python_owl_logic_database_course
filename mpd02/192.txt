Multi-modal neuroimaging projects such as the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and 
UK Biobank are advancing our understanding of human brain architecture, function,
connectivity, and their variability across individuals using high-quality
non-invasive data from many subjects. Such efforts depend upon the accuracy of
non-invasive brain imaging measures. However, 'ground truth' validation of
connectivity using invasive tracers is not feasible in humans. Studies using
nonhuman primates (NHPs) enable comparisons between invasive and non-invasive
measures, including exploration of how "functional connectivity" from fMRI and
"tractographic connectivity" from diffusion MRI compare with long-distance
connections measured using tract tracing. Our NonHuman Primate Neuroimaging &
Neuroanatomy Project (NHP_NNP) is an international effort (6 laboratories in 5
countries) to: (i) acquire and analyze high-quality multi-modal brain imaging
data of macaque and marmoset monkeys using protocols and methods adapted from the
HCP; (ii) acquire quantitative invasive tract-tracing data for cortical and
subcortical projections to cortical areas; and (iii) map the distributions of
different brain cell types with immunocytochemical stains to better define brain 
areal boundaries. We are acquiring high-resolution structural, functional, and
diffusion MRI data together with behavioral measures from over 100 individual
macaques and marmosets in order to generate non-invasive measures of brain
architecture such as myelin and cortical thickness maps, as well as functional
and diffusion tractography-based connectomes. We are using classical and
next-generation anatomical tracers to generate quantitative connectivity maps
based on brain-wide counting of labeled cortical and subcortical neurons,
providing ground truth measures of connectivity. Advanced statistical modeling
techniques address the consistency of both kinds of data across individuals,
allowing comparison of tracer-based and non-invasive MRI-based connectivity
measures. We aim to develop improved cortical and subcortical areal atlases by
combining histological and imaging methods. Finally, we are collecting genetic
and sociality-associated behavioral data in all animals in an effort to
understand how genetic variation shapes the connectome and behavior.

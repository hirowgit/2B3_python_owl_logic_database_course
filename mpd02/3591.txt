PROBLEM: The effect of neonatal treatment with a gonadotropin releasing hormone
(GnRH) antagonist on the morphology and distribution of lymphocytes in lymphoid
tissue of the infant marmoset was examined.
METHOD OF STUDY: From a screened panel of antihuman antibodies for specific
immune cells, antibodies for the CD20 and CD3 antigens showed excellent
reactivity with marmoset tissue. Five sets of marmoset twins were treated with
either the GnRH antagonist or a vehicle from birth, and were euthanized at 7 to 9
(3 sets) or 16 to 20 weeks (2 sets) of age. The spleen, thymus, and inguinal
lymph nodes from each animal were processed for immunocytochemistry, and the
number of cells expressing the CD20 and CD3 antigens were quantified.
RESULTS: Control twins exhibited high plasma levels of testosterone,
characteristic of the neonatal period, whereas testosterone concentrations were
reduced (P = 0.001) to detection limits in the GnRH antagonist-treated twins.
Microscopic evaluation suggested that treatment reduced the volume and
cellularity of the thymic cortex, resulting in a decrease in the
cortical-to-medullary ratio. Treatment reduced (P = 0.046) the number of
thymocytes expressing the B-cell antigen (CD20) and marginally lowered (P =
0.067) the number expressing the T-cell antigen (CD3) in the thymic medulla. In
the spleens of treated animals, periarterial lymphatic sheaths were less
prominent on microscopic examination, and there were marginally fewer (P = 0.064)
CD3+ cells. Numbers of CD20+ lymphocytes in the peripheral white pulp of the
spleen and in the germinal centers of the lymph nodes, or CD3+ cells in the
paracortex and germinal centers of the lymph nodes, were not altered by
treatment.
CONCLUSION: Neonatal treatment with a GnRH antagonist may alter maturational
processes for B and T cells in the thymus and spleen of the marmoset and may
deprive the immune system of its normal sensitivity to GnRH at a potentially
critical time in development.

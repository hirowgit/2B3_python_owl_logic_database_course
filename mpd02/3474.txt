Among haplorhine primates, the highly specialized Callitrichidae (marmosets and
tamarins) are expected to have comparatively high reproductive costs, a feature
that might be related to the evolution of a cooperative breeding system. Costs of
reproduction in captivity were investigated on the basis of changes in energy
intake and body weight during pregnancy and lactation in pair-living female and
male common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus). The experimental design had little
effect on carrying behavior, food intake, and body weight of adults, but a
negative transitory effect of offspring body weight. Increased energetic
requirements during pregnancy did not result in a higher energy intake in
females. During lactation, females increased their energy intake up to 100% and
gradually lost weight, suggesting even higher costs. Extensive carrying behavior 
by males, on the other hand, did not result in an increased energy intake in
males, or in changes in male body weight. It is suggested that, at least in
captivity, increased energetic demands during reproduction are reduced by
behavior allocations towards energetically less expensive behaviors.

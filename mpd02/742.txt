autism induced by prenatal exposure to valproic acid.

Humans and various nonhuman primates respond negatively to inequity not in their 
favor (i.e., inequity aversion), when inequity between two individuals is
introduced. Common marmosets, a highly prosocial species, further discriminated
between human actors who reciprocated in social exchanges, and those who did not.
Conversely, marmoset models of autism, induced via prenatal exposure to valproic 
acid (VPA marmosets), did not discriminate. Interestingly, previous studies of
inequity aversion in marmosets have produced negative results, or were limited to
males. Recent studies suggest that inequity aversion is highly influenced by the 
tasks employed. Here we show inequity aversion in both male and female marmosets 
using a novel task which required a relatively long duration of response.
Marmosets were required to hold a spoon for 2 s to receive a reward. Marmosets
successfully performed the task when they observed an unfamiliar conspecific
partner obtaining the same reward (equity test). However, when they witnessed the
partner receiving a more attractive reward for equal effort (inequity test),
unexposed marmosets, which were not exposed to either valproic acid or saline
during the fetal period refused to respond. This inequity aversion was not
observed in unexposed marmosets when the partner was absent.　In contrast,
marmosets with fetal exposure to valproic acid (VPA marmosets) successfully
executed the task irrespective of their partners' reward conditions. As prenatal 
exposure to valproic acid is a well-known procedure to induce autism spectrum
disorder (ASD)-like behaviors in rodents, we propose that VPA marmosets failed to
show inequity aversion due to weak social motivation or interest towards others.

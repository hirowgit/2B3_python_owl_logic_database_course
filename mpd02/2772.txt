The basal ganglia in the brain contains glutamate, dopamine, serotonin,
noradrenaline, CCK, adenosine, opioid, cannabinoid, etc. These agents contribute 
to keep motor control and modulation of the agent may be a cue to the treatment
of movement disorders. D1 or D2 dopamine receptor agonists increase locomotor
activity in MPTP-treated common marmosets which showed decreased locomotor
activity and decreased number of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra. Using 
this model of parkinsonism, NMDA receptor antag-onists, antimuscarinic receptor
antagonists, 5-HT1A receptor agonists, adenosine receptor antagonists were showed
to reverse the impaired movement of the model animals. The results may contribute
to the development of new drugs for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.

The myoglobin of primates: the Night Monkey, Aotes trivirgatus (Cebidae,
Platyrrhini, Anthropoidea).

Heinbokel N, Lehmann H.

The amino acid sequence of the myoglobin of the South American Night Monkey,
Aotes trivirgatus, is identical to that of the marmoset (Callithrix jacchus [1]) 
except for residue 21 which is isoleucine in the marmoset, like in all other
anthropoids, but valine in Aotes. Analysis of a possible pathway of the evolution
of Aotes myoglobin using 18 known primate myoglobin sequences [2-5] supports the 
classification of the Night Monkey within Anthropoidea and Platyrrhini but it
indicates that this species might be more closely related to the marmoset (family
Callitrichidae) than to the family Cebidae as a member of which it is commonly
classified.

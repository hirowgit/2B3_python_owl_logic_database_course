Primary structures of adult hemoglobins of silvery marmoset, Callithrix
argentatus, and cotton-headed tamarin, Saguinus oedipus.

Maita T, Hayashida M, Matsuda G.

Tryptic peptides of the alpha and beta chains from silvery marmoset (Callithrix
argentatus) and cotton-headed tamarin (Saguinus oedipus) hemoglobins were
isolated and sequenced, respectively, by conventional methods. The ordering of
the peptides in each chain was deduced from the homology of their sequences with 
those of human adult hemoglobin. The primary structures thus deduced are compared
with those of other primate hemoglobins, and the rate of evolution in New World
monkey hemoglobins is discussed.

Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne arbovirus that can cause severe congenital 
birth defects. The utmost goal of ZIKV vaccines is to prevent both maternal-fetal
infection and congenital Zika syndrome. A Zika purified inactivated virus (ZPIV) 
was previously shown to be protective in non-pregnant mice and rhesus macaques.
In this study, we further examined the efficacy of ZPIV against ZIKV infection
during pregnancy in immunocompetent C57BL6 mice and common marmoset monkeys
(Callithrix jacchus). We showed that, in C57BL/6 mice, ZPIV significantly reduced
ZIKV-induced fetal malformations. Protection of fetuses was positively correlated
with virus-neutralizing antibody levels. In marmosets, the vaccine prevented
vertical transmission of ZIKV and elicited neutralizing antibodies that remained 
above a previously determined threshold of protection for up to 18 months. These 
proof-of-concept studies demonstrate ZPIV's protective efficacy is both potent
and durable and has the potential to prevent the harmful consequence of ZIKV
infection during pregnancy.

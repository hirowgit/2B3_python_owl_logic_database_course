Using heterologous prime-boost (DNA immunization followed by immunization with
transfected cells), we have generated depleting mouse anti-baboon CD2 monoclonal 
antibodies (mAb). These anti-CD2 mAb recognized a diverse range of primate CD2
from New World monkeys and Old World monkeys to humans and have potent
immunosuppressive activity for human allo-MLR responses and anti-tetanus-toxoid
recall responses. There was no upregulation of activation markers or release of
cytokines when the mAb were incubated with human peripheral blood mononuclear
cells. Using chimeric NOD-SCID IL2rgamma(null) mice, the mAb were shown to
deplete human and cynomolgus monkey T cells in vivo. These anti-CD2 mAb may
therefore be important immunological tools in allo- and xenotransplantation.

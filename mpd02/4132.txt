We developed an operant paradigm for measuring effects of reproductive steroids
on maternal motivation in common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus). Conditioned
response regulated females' exposure to maternal reinforcement. Nulliparous
females (n = 15) with experience with infants in social groups were subjects. The
paradigm was validated by examining (a) effects of reinforcing stimuli on
affective behavior in a nonoperant paradigm, (b) responsiveness of operant
performance to changes in reinforcing stimuli and reinforcement schedule, (c)
changes in operant responding due to omission of reinforcement, and (d) relation 
between operant responding and species-typical maternal behavior. In pregnant
females, (n = 4), frequency of bar pressing and estradiol:progesterone ratio were
maximal just before birth. Nonpregnant females (n = 3) treated with progesterone 
and estradiol to mimic late-pregnancy steroid profiles showed increased operant
maternal behavior.

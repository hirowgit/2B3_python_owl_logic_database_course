It has been shown that inhibition of phosphodiesterase (PDE) or an increase in
intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) can lower the intraocular
pressure in mammalian eyes. The PDE inhibitor rolipram binds with high affinity
to a cAMP-dependent PDE. In the following study, receptors for rolipram in the
mammalian eye are determined by autoradiography. About 1050 histological sections
of rabbit (albino and pigmented), rat, monkey (baboon and marmoset) and human
eyes were examined concerning rolipram-binding sites in different structures. The
highest specific binding of rolipram to the ciliary body epithelium was seen in
human, rabbit and baboon eyes. Marmoset eyes showed the highest specific binding 
in the ciliary body muscle, rat eyes in the retina. Specific binding was
consistently high in the ciliary body epithelium and therefore at the site of
aqueous humor formation. Because of these results and the known mode of action of
rolipram, one can assume a close connection between rolipram-binding sites and
the regulation of intraocular pressure.

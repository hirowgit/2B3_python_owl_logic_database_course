BACKGROUND: Protocadherin-11 is a cell adhesion molecule of the cadherin
superfamily. Since, only in humans, its paralog is found on the Y chromosome, it 
is expected that protocadherin-11X/Y plays some role in human brain evolution or 
sex differences. Recently, a genetic mutation of protocadherin-11X/Y was reported
to be associated with a language development disorder. Here, we compared the
expression of protocadherin-11 X-linked in developing postnatal brains of mouse
(rodent) and common marmoset (non-human primate) to explore its possible
involvement in mammalian brain evolution. We also investigated its expression in 
the Bengalese finch (songbird) to explore a possible function in animal
vocalization and human language faculties.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Protocadherin-11 X-linked was strongly expressed 
in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, amygdala and brainstem. Comparative analysis
between mice and marmosets revealed that in certain areas of marmoset brain, the 
expression was clearly enriched. In Bengalese finches, protocadherin-11 X-linked 
was expressed not only in nuclei of regions of the vocal production pathway and
the tracheosyringeal hypoglossal nucleus, but also in areas homologous to the
mammalian amygdala and hippocampus. In both marmosets and Bengalese finches, its 
expression in pallial vocal control areas was developmentally regulated, and no
clear expression was seen in the dorsal striatum, indicating a similarity between
songbirds and non-human primates.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results suggest that the enriched expression of
protocadherin-11 X-linked is involved in primate brain evolution and that some
similarity exists between songbirds and primates regarding the neural basis for
vocalization.

The present study describes the morphology and distribution of substance
P-immunoreactive (SP-ir) elements in the olfactory bulb (OB) and olfactory
peduncle (OP) of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a primate species.
SP-ir neurons are very abundant in the OB and belong to two types. External
tufted cells are present in the glomerular layer (GL), whereas granule cells are 
found in the deeper layers, especially in the granule cell layer (GRL), but also 
scattered in the OP. SP-ir fibers, putatively of central origin, were identified 
in the OP. They ascend into the bulbar layers. The SP-chemoarchitecture of the
marmoset OB and OP does not differ more from rat, guinea pig and cat, than the
SP-chemoarchitecture of these species varies among one another.

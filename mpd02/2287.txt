Inhalational anthrax is a rare but potentially fatal infection in man. The common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) was evaluated as a small non-human primate (NHP)
model of inhalational anthrax infection, as an alternative to larger NHP species.
The marmoset was found to be susceptible to inhalational exposure to Bacillus
anthracis Ames strain. The pathophysiology of infection following inhalational
exposure was similar to that previously reported in the rhesus and cynomolgus
macaque and humans. The calculated LD(50) for B. anthracis Ames strain in the
marmoset was 1.47 x 10(3) colony-forming units, compared with a published LD(50) 
of 5.5 x 10(4) spores in the rhesus macaque and 4.13 x 10(3) spores in the
cynomolgus macaque. This suggests that the common marmoset is an appropriate
alternative NHP and will be used for the evaluation of medical countermeasures
against respiratory anthrax infection.

Poxvirus infection in a colony of common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus).

An epizootic poxvirus infection occurred in a colony of 80 common marmosets
(Callithrix jacchus) recently introduced to a laboratory facility. Over an
18-week period, 29 of the monkeys exhibited skin lesions that persisted for 4-6
weeks. Although eight marmosets died during the outbreak, their deaths were not
attributed directly to the poxvirus infection. The skin lesions developed over
the entire body surface including the soles and palms. Initially characterized as
erythematous papules, they quickly changed to elevated coalescing lesions with
extensive scab formation. Histopathologically, the lesions revealed moderate to
marked acanthosis, and they progressed to full-thickness epidermal necrosis and
ulceration. Intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies were observed occasionally within
degenerate keratinocytes. These inclusions most probably constituted the
intracytoplasmic aggregates of viral particles observed ultrastructurally and
confirmed as members of the poxvirus group by negative staining of direct skin
scrapings.

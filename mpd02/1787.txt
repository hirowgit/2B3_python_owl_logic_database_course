Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus (RVFV) can cause severe human disease characterized
by either acute-onset hepatitis, delayed-onset encephalitis, retinitis and
blindness, or a hemorrhagic syndrome. The existing nonhuman primate (NHP) model
for RVF utilizes an intravenous (i.v.) exposure route in rhesus macaques (Macaca 
mulatta). Severe disease in these animals is infrequent, and large cohorts are
needed to observe significant morbidity and mortality. To overcome these
drawbacks, we evaluated the infectivity and pathogenicity of RVFV in the common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) by i.v., subcutaneous (s.c.), and intranasal
exposure routes to more closely mimic natural exposure. Marmosets were more
susceptible to RVFV than rhesus macaques and experienced higher rates of
morbidity, mortality, and viremia and marked aberrations in hematological and
chemistry values. An overwhelming infection of hepatocytes was a major
consequence of infection of marmosets by the i.v. and s.c. exposure routes.
Additionally, these animals displayed signs of hemorrhagic manifestations and
neurological impairment. Based on our results, the common marmoset model more
closely resembles severe human RVF disease and is therefore an ideal model for
the evaluation of potential vaccines and therapeutics.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a small New World primate, is receiving
substantial attention in the neuroscience and biomedical science fields because
its anatomical features, functional and behavioral characteristics, and
reproductive features and its amenability to available genetic modification
technologies make it an attractive experimental subject. In this review, I
outline the progress of marmoset neuroscience research and summarize both the
current status (opportunities and limitations) of and the future perspectives on 
the application of marmosets in neuroscience and disease modeling.

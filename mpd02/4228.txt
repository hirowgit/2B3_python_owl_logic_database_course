Plasma levels of endothelin (ET), plasma renin activity (PRA) and angiotensin II 
(Ang II) were measured in anaesthetized marmosets exposed to acute aortic
stenosis proximal to the renal arteries. In vehicle experiments, ET rose from 5
+/- 2 to 38 +/- 4 pg ml-1, PRA from 5 +/- 2 to 99 +/- 21 ng ml-1 h-1 and Ang II
from 21 +/- 4 to 213 +/- 76 pg ml-1. Administration of renin inhibitor and
angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor reduced PRA and Ang II to control levels,
while the plasma levels of ET increased further (51 +/- 10 and 71 +/- 16 pg ml-1,
respectively). During aortic stenosis the two isoforms ET-1 and ET-3 appeared in 
the circulation, while in conscious control animals only ET-1 was found. It is
concluded that the increased plasma levels of ET in our primate model could not
be ascribed to the increased circulating levels of PRA and Ang II.

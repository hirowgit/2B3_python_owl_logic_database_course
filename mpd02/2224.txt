Some neurons in auditory cortex respond to recent stimulus history by adapting
their response functions to track stimulus statistics directly, as might be
expected. In contrast, some neurons respond to loud sounds by adjusting their
response functions away from high intensities and consequently remain sensitive
to softer sounds. In marmoset monkey auditory cortex, the latter type of
adaptation appears to exist only in neurons tuned to stimulus intensity.

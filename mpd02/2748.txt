Previous studies have found a clear relationship between prolactin (prl) and
paternal care in various vertebrate taxa. In New World monkeys, it has been
demonstrated in several species that fathers have high prolactin levels even
during periods without infant rearing. In this study, we followed the
reproductive careers of common marmoset males as they transitioned from being an 
adult son within their native family to fathering their own offspring for the
first time. Specifically, we examined the first experience of elevated prolactin 
levels in marmoset males. Additionally, we investigated the effects of the total 
number of experienced births as well as of age on prolactin levels. Our results
show that common marmoset males did not experience an increase in prolactin
secretion after pairing or shortly before birth of their first infants. However, 
prolactin levels rose more than twofold after the birth of their first infants
and had lowered again 2.5 months after this event. We found no correlation
between prolactin levels and the number of previous births experienced or age.
Our study demonstrates that further work about a possible enhancing effect of
prolactin on paternal care, by means of experimentally reducing hormonal levels, 
should be conducted in common marmosets using first-time fathers before males
experience the first paternal increase in prolactin levels.

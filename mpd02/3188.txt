In the present study, changes in the immunohistochemical localization of
endometrial estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) during various 
stages of the ovarian cyclicity in common marmoset, have been reported. Ovarian
cyclicity was monitored by estimating plasma estradiol and progesterone. During
the early follicular phase, weak ER immunolocalization was observed in the
endometrial stroma. During the late follicular phase under the influence of
rising estradiol levels, stromal ER localization was intense. During the luteal
phase, ER localization was absent in the stroma indicating that high
concentrations of progesterone suppressed ER. PR localization was not observed in
the stroma during the early follicular phase, while weak staining was seen in the
stroma during the late follicular phase. PR localization was maximum during the
mid luteal phase. However in marmoset, endometrial ER and PR localization was
restricted only to the stroma. This unique feature may be due to the
characteristic reproductive profile of this nonmenstruating species and needs to 
be studied further. Thus it can be hypothesized that in the marmoset endometrium,
steroid hormone mediated effects possibly occur directly in the stroma and are
then transmitted to the epithelium by autocrine/paracrine action of growth
factors and cytokines.

The transplantation of neuronal tissue into the brains of patients with
Parkinson's disease is already being assessed as an experimental treatment for
the symptoms of this disease, and the possibility of using similar graft tissue
to ameliorate the symptoms of other neurodegenerative diseases is being
considered. In this context, a small number of transplant experiments have been
carried out in monkeys with lesions of the central dopamine and cholinergic
systems. These experiments make it possible to determine the optimum methods of
transplantation in an animal whose brain is structurally more closely related to 
the human than that of the rat and to assess the behavioral consequences of
transplantation on symptoms that either resemble very closely the symptoms seen
in patients, or are of a complex cognitive nature and are therefore more
difficult to measure in the rat. It is intended that these experiments will
contribute to the development of better treatments for the neurodegenerative
diseases, either by the use of transplantation as a clinical treatment, or by
contributing to a better understanding of the mechanisms that normally maintain
neuronal function and that fail in these diseases.

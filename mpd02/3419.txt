It is widely believed that common marmosets (Callithrx jacchus) typically give
birth to twins under natural conditions. In captivity, however, births of
triplets or even larger litters are common, although parents rarely succeed in
rearing more than two offspring. The traditional interpretation is that captive
conditions, notably the ready availability of food, have led to increased
reproductive output, perhaps involving a higher ovulation rate. The present paper
provides evidence, combined from ultrasound examinations between ovulation and
birth and hysterotomies conducted during the late embryonic and early fetal
phase, that the litter size can be progressively reduced during pregnancy without
spontaneous abortion. There is an unusually long lag phase prior to the onset of 
embryonic growth in common marmosets; the fetal stage does not begin until day 80
of the 144-day pregnancy. Reduction in litter size occurs during embryonic stages
(up to day 80), and continues into the fetal stages. These results indicate that 
the common marmoset is adapted for flexible modification of litter size between
ovulation and birth. The high incidence of triplet births in captive colonies may
therefore be an expression of an adapted natural developmental process under
artificial circumstances.

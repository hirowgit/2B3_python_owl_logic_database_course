CONCLUSION: We conclude that facial nerve injury induced by compression is
associated with a reasonable time window (4 weeks) that allows possible
neurotrophic effects to be analyzed. Additionally, there are no hints of
cross-innervation by the contralateral facial nerve or parallel innervation by
other nerves in the hemiface ipsilateral to the injured nerve.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this work was to develop an experimental model of facial
nerve injury in nonhuman primates (Callithrix sp.).
METHODS: In this study, individuals of the non-human primate species Callithrix
sp. were subjected to three different types of facial nerve injury, and they were
observed for 27 days after surgery by video to record their facial movements.
RESULTS: Two types of nerve compression caused severe initial facial paralysis
followed by gradual recovery until normal levels were reached at the end of the
evaluation period. Injury induced by nerve resection was followed by a complete
lack of facial movement recovery.

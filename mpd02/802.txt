Here, we report the existence of meningeal lymphatic vessels in human and
nonhuman primates (common marmoset monkeys) and the feasibility of noninvasively 
imaging and mapping them in vivo with high-resolution, clinical MRI. On T2-FLAIR 
and T1-weighted black-blood imaging, lymphatic vessels enhance with gadobutrol, a
gadolinium-based contrast agent with high propensity to extravasate across a
permeable capillary endothelial barrier, but not with gadofosveset, a blood-pool 
contrast agent. The topography of these vessels, running alongside dural venous
sinuses, recapitulates the meningeal lymphatic system of rodents. In primates,
meningeal lymphatics display a typical panel of lymphatic endothelial markers by 
immunohistochemistry. This discovery holds promise for better understanding the
normal physiology of lymphatic drainage from the central nervous system and
potential aberrations in neurological diseases.

OBJECTIVE: To report the first Ilheus arboviruses isolated from wild birds and
analyze its public health impact.
METHODS: Wild birds and mammals were captured using mist nets and Tomahawk traps,
respectively. Blood samples were drawn from these animals and inoculated
intracerebrally in Swiss suckling mice found in the Parque Ecológico do Tietê,
Brazil. The isolates were identified by serological tests, such as
hemagglutination, hemagglutination inhibition, complement fixation and
neutralization. Besides virus isolation, serum samples were also tested for the
presence of hemagglutination inhibition antibodies.
RESULTS: Two strains of Ilheus virus were isolated from the bird species
Sporophila caerulescens and Molothrus bonariensis. Specific antibodies to Ilheus 
virus were detected in serum samples of some birds (Columbina talpacoti, Geopelia
cuneata, Sicalis flaveola and Molothrus bonariensis), marmosets (Callithrix
jacchus and Callithrix penicillata) and coati (Nasua nasua).
CONCLUSIONS: Virus isolation and detection of specific antibodies in serum
samples of local, migratory and captive birds, captive marmosets and wild coati
corroborate the circulation of Ilheus virus in the Parque Ecológico do Tietê. The
migrating behavior of some species of wild birds, like Sporophila caerulescens,
enables the virus spread to other regions. Taking into consideration its human
pathogenicity and the presence of the virus in this area, local authorities
should be aware of the risk of infecting the local community.

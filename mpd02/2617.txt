Nonhuman animals steeply discount the future, showing a preference for small,
immediate over large, delayed rewards. Currently unclear is whether discounting
functions depend on context. Here, we examine the effects of spatial context on
discounting in cotton-top tamarins (Saguinus oedipus) and common marmosets
(Callithrix jacchus), species known to differ in temporal discounting. We
presented subjects with a choice between small, nearby rewards and large, distant
rewards. Tamarins traveled farther for the large reward than marmosets, attending
to the ratio of reward differences rather than their absolute values. This
species difference contrasts with performance on a temporal task in which
marmosets waited longer than tamarins for the large reward. These comparative
data indicate that context influences choice behavior, with the strongest effect 
seen in marmosets who discounted more steeply over space than over time. These
findings parallel details of each species' feeding ecology. Tamarins range over
large distances and feed primarily on insects, which requires using quick,
impulsive action. Marmosets range over shorter distances than tamarins and feed
primarily on tree exudates, a clumped resource that requires patience to wait for
sap to exude. These results show that discounting functions are context specific,
shaped by a history of ecological pressures.

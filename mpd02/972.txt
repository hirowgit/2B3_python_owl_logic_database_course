There has been recent increasing interest in the use of marmosets, a New World
primate species, as a model in biomedical research. One of the principal
advantages of marmosets as a research model is their rich vocal repertoire and
communicative vocal behaviors displayed both in the wild and in captivity.
Studies of this species' vocal communication system have the potential to reveal 
the evolutionary underpinnings of human speech, and therefore are of interest to 
the neuroscience and biology research communities. Here a recent research into
the behavioral and neurobiological basis of marmoset vocal communication was
reviewed and they argued for their broader value as a neuroscientific model. They
discuss potential avenues for future research including developmental
neurobiology and the application of modern molecular tools to the study of
primate communication. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Develop Neurobiol 77:

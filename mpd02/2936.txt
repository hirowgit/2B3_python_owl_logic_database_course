A morphological study of the oblique ligament in the thumb is presented. The
ligament was consistently described in human specimens and compared with
dissections of non-human primates from different species. The oblique ligament
was found in some, but not all, specimens in each of the following species
examined: chimpanzee, orangutan, gibbon, anubis baboon, hamadryas baboon,
squirrel monkey, lemur and marmoset. A revised identity of the oblique ligament
is proposed as a reinforced distal border of a fibro-osseous annular pollical
flexor sheath and whose function is not independent of the flexor sheath. The
constant presence and tendinous trait of the pollical oblique ligament in humans,
when compared with non-human primates, supports the notion that the oblique
ligament strengthens the pollical flexor sheath in humans for restraint of the
flexor pollicis longus tendon during forceful precision pinching. A derivation of
the pollical oblique ligament is considered as representing a vestigial radial
limb of a flexor pollicis superficialis tendon in the thumb.

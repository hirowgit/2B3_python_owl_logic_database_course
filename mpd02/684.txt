Quantifying cortisol concentration in hair is a non-invasive biomarker of
long-term hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) activation, and thus can provide
important information on laboratory animal health. Marmosets (Callithrix jacchus)
and capuchins (Cebus apella) are New World primates increasingly used in
biomedical and neuroscience research, yet published hair cortisol concentrations 
for these species are limited. Review of the existing published hair cortisol
values from marmosets reveals highly discrepant values and the use of variable
techniques for hair collection, processing, and cortisol extraction. In this
investigation we utilized a well-established, standardized protocol to extract
and quantify cortisol from marmoset (n = 12) and capuchin (n = 4) hair. Shaved
hair samples were collected from the upper thigh during scheduled exams and
analyzed via methanol extraction and enzyme immunoassay. In marmosets, hair
cortisol concentration ranged from 2,710 to 6,267 pg/mg and averaged
4,070 ± 304 pg/mg. In capuchins, hair cortisol concentration ranged from 621 to
2,089 pg/mg and averaged 1,092 ± 338 pg/mg. Hair cortisol concentration was
significantly different between marmosets and capuchins, with marmosets having
higher concentrations than capuchins. The incorporation of hair cortisol analysis
into research protocols provides a non-invasive measure of HPA axis activity over
time, which offers insight into animal health. Utilization of standard protocols 
across laboratories is essential to obtaining valid measurements and allowing for
valuable future cross-species comparisons.

Dengue virus (DENV) causes a wide range of illnesses in humans: dengue fever
(DF), dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Animal
models that constantly develop high levels of viraemia are required for the
development of protective and preventive measures. Common marmosets (Callithrix
jacchus) demonstrated high levels of viraemia after inoculation with clinical
isolates of four serotypes of DENV; in particular, over 10(6) genome copies
ml(-1) after inoculation with DENV-2. Non-structural protein 1 and DENV-specific 
IgM and IgG antibodies were consistently detected. The DENV-2 genome was detected
in lymphoid organs including the lymph nodes, spleen and thymus, and also in
non-lymphoid organs. DENV antigen was detected by immunohistochemistry in the
liver and spleen from inoculated marmosets. Four marmosets were reinoculated with
DENV-2 at 33 weeks after primary inoculation with DENV-2. The DENV-2 genome was
not detected in any of these marmosets, indicating protection from a secondary
infection. The results indicate that common marmosets are highly sensitive to
DENV infection, and suggest that marmosets could be a reliable primate model for 
the evaluation of candidate vaccines.

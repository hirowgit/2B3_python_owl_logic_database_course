Infiltration of leukocytes is a major pathological event in white matter lesion
formation in the brain of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. In grey matter
lesions, less infiltration of these cells occur, but microglial activation is
present. Thus far, the interaction of β-integrins with extracellular matrix
proteins, e.g. fibronectin, is considered to be of importance for the influx of
immune cells. Recent in vitro studies indicate a possible role for the enzyme
tissue Transglutaminase (TG2) in mediating cell adhesion and migration. In the
present study we questioned whether TG2 is present in white and grey matter
lesions observed in the marmoset model for MS. To this end, immunohistochemical
studies were performed. We observed that TG2, expressed by infiltrating monocytes
in white matter lesions co-expressed β1-integrin and is located in close
apposition to deposited fibronectin. These data suggest an important role for TG2
in the adhesion and migration of infiltrating monocytes during white matter
lesion formation. Moreover, in grey matter lesions, TG2 is mainly present in
microglial cells together with some β1-integrin, whereas fibronectin is absent in
these lesions. These data imply an alternative role for microglial-derived TG2 in
grey matter lesions, e.g. cell proliferation. Further research should clarify the
functional role of TG2 in monocytes or microglial cells in MS lesion formation.

Matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors of general formula (1) were synthesised by a 
route involving an Ireland-Claisen rearrangement which enables systematic
modification of the substituent alpha to the hydroxamic acid. An analogue (12c)
possessing an alpha-cyclopentyl group is a potent broad spectrum inhibitor that
displays high and sustained blood levels following oral dosing in both the rat
and marmoset ex-vivo bioassays. This compound and analogues are also potent
inhibitors of TNF alpha release.

The provision of adequate space for laboratory animals is essential not only for 
good welfare but accurate studies. For example, housing conditions for primates
used in biomedical research may negatively affect welfare and thus the
reliability of findings. In common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus), an appropriate
cage size enables a socially harmonious family environment and optimizes
reproductive potential. In this study, we investigated the effects of cage size
on body weight (BW), behavior, and nursing succession in the common marmoset.
Large cages (LCs) with environment enrichment led to an increase in BW while
small cages (SCs) caused stereotypic behaviors that were not observed in LCs. In 
addition, the BW of infants increased with aging in LCs. Our findings indicate
that the welfare of marmosets was enhanced by living in LCs. Research on
non-human primates is essential for understanding the human brain and developing 
knowledge-based strategies for the diagnosis and treatment of psychiatric and
neurological disorders. Thus, the present findings are important because they
indicate that different cages may influence emotional and behavioral phenotypes.

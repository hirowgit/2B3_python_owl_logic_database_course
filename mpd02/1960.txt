The in vivo characterization of a dual adenosine A(2A)/A(1) receptor antagonist
in several animal models of Parkinson's disease is described. Discovery and
scale-up syntheses of compound 1 are described in detail, highlighting
optimization steps that increased the overall yield of 1 from 10.0% to 30.5%.
Compound 1 is a potent A(2A)/A(1) receptor antagonist in vitro (A(2A) K(i) = 4.1 
nM; A(1) K(i) = 17.0 nM) that has excellent activity, after oral administration, 
across a number of animal models of Parkinson's disease including mouse and rat
models of haloperidol-induced catalepsy, mouse model of reserpine-induced
akinesia, rat 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesion model of drug-induced rotation,
and MPTP-treated non-human primate model.

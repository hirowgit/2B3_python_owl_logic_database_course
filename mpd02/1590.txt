BACKGROUND: The objective of this investigation was to define the phenotype and
spatial distribution of Clara cells within the respiratory tract of common
marmosets and to distinguish them from other non-ciliated cells (goblet cells,
mixed type secretory cells).
METHODS: Non-ciliated cells were identified immunohistochemically using
antibodies against Clara cell secretory protein and mucin 5AC. Transmission
electron microscopy and scanning electron microscopy were performed to
characterize Clara cells ultrastructurally.
RESULTS: Clara cells were present throughout the tracheobronchial tree, with
lowest numbers in the trachea and highest numbers in bronchioles. Goblet cells
and mixed type cells were scarce in the upper conducting airways and virtually
absent within bronchioles. Ultrastructurally, Clara cells showed typical apical
electron-dense granules and a prominent granular endoplasmatic reticulum.
CONCLUSIONS: Clara cells of common marmosets have species-specific morphological 
characteristics, which suggest grouping the common marmoset phenotypically
between primates and rodents.

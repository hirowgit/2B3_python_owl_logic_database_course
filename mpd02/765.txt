A monkey model of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection is urgently needed to better
understand transmission and pathogenesis, given its proven association with fetal
brain defects in pregnant women and acute neurological illness. Here we
experimentally infected 4 male marmosets with ZIKV (prototype 1947 African
strain) and monitored them clinically with sampling of various body fluids and
tissues for nearly 3 months. We show that the course of acute infection with ZIKV
in these New World monkeys resembles the human illness in many respects,
including (1) lack of apparent clinical symptoms in most cases, (2) persistence
of the virus in body fluids such as semen and saliva for longer periods of time
than in serum, and (3) generation of neutralizing antibodies as well as an
antiviral immunological host response. Importantly, ZIKV-infected saliva samples 
(in addition to serum) were found to be infectious, suggesting potential capacity
for viral transmission by the oral route. Re-challenge of a previously infected
marmoset with a contemporary outbreak strain SPH2015 from Brazil resulted in
continued protection against infection, no viral shedding, and boosting of the
immune response. Given the key similarities to human infection, a marmoset model 
of ZIKV infection may be useful for testing of new drugs and vaccines.

Most New World monkey species have both dichromatic and trichromatic individuals 
present in the same population. The selective forces acting to maintain the
variation are hotly debated and are relevant to the evolution of the 'routine'
trichromatic colour vision found in catarrhine primates. While trichromats have a
foraging advantage for red food compared with dichromats, visual tasks which
dichromats perform better have received less attention. Here we examine the
effects of light intensity on foraging success among marmosets. We find that
dichromats outperform trichomats when foraging in shade, but not in sun. The
simplest explanation is that dichromats pay more attention to achromatic cues
than trichromats. However, dichromats did not show a preference for foraging in
shade compared with trichromats. Our results reveal several interesting parallels
with a recent study in capuchin monkeys (Cebus capucinus), and suggest that
dichromat advantage for certain tasks contributes to maintenance of the colour
vision polymorphism.

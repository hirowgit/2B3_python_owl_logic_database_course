Fabry disease is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by the deficiency of
α-galactosidase A. Enzyme deficiency results in a progressive decline in renal
and cardiac function, leading to cardiomyopathy and end-stage renal disease.
Current treatments available, including enzyme replacement therapies, have
provided significant benefit to patients; however, unmet medical needs remain.
mRNA therapy, with drug-like properties, has the unique ability to produce
therapeutic proteins endogenously. Here we describe the sustained delivery of
therapeutic human α-galactosidase protein in vivo via nanoparticle-formulated
mRNA in mouse and non-human primate, with a demonstration of efficacy through
clinically relevant biomarker reduction in a mouse Fabry disease model.
Multi-component nanoparticles formulated with lipids and lipid-like materials
were developed for the delivery of mRNA encoding human α-galactosidase protein.
Upon delivery of human GLA mRNA to mice, serum GLA protein levels reached as high
as ∼1,330-fold over normal physiological values.

Using a primate analogue of the Wisconsin Card Sort Test, this study
demonstrated, for the first time, that lesions of the prefrontal cortex in
monkeys produce a qualitatively similar impairment in attentional set-shifting to
that seen following prefrontal cortical damage in humans. Although damage to the 
prefrontal cortex did not disrupt the ability of marmosets, a New World monkey,
to maintain an attentional set, it did disrupt their ability to shift an
attentional set. It also impaired their performance on discrimination reversal,
object retrieval, and spatial delayed response, consistent with the effects of
prefrontal damage in Old World monkeys. Comparison of the cognitive processes
underlying discrimination reversal, object retrieval, and attentional
set-shifting reveals the various types of inhibitory control provided by the
prefrontal cortex.

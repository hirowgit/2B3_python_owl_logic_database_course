The Rete ovarii and follicle formation in marmosets (Callithrix jacchus and
Callithrix penicillata).

Guedes ML, Miraglia T.

The Rete ovarii in young marmosets shows a strong reactivity for a certain number
of enzymes (LDH; NADH2-TR; NADPH2-TR; G-6-PDH; 6-PGDH; alpha-GPDH; beta-OHBDH and
nonspecific esterase). The granulosa cells of the cortical innermost placed
follicles have the same enzymatic reactivity. The germinal epithelium results
negative to the mentioned group of enzymes at this phase of the development. The 
Rete ovarii must play an important r√¥le in the granulosa cells differentiation.

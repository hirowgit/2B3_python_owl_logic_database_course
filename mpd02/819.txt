Reptiles are the first amniotes to develop an intromitent penis, however until
now the mechanisms involved in the electrical field stimulation-induced
contraction on corpora cavernosa isolated from Crotalus durissus terrificus were 
not investigated. Crotalus and rabbit corpora cavernosa were mounted in 10 mL
organ baths for isometric tension recording. Electrical field stimulation
(EFS)-induced contractions were performed in presence/absence of phentolamine (10
μM), guanethidine (30 μM), tetrodotoxin (1 μM and 1mM), A-803467 (10 μM),
3-iodo-L-Tyrosine (1 mM), salsolinol (3 μM) and a modified Krebs solution
(equimolar substitution of NaCl by N-methyl-D-glucamine). Immuno-histochemistry
for tyrosine hydroxylase was also performed. Electrical field stimulation (EFS; 8
Hz and 16 Hz) caused contractions in both Crotalus and rabbit corpora cavernosa. 
The contractions were abolished by previous incubation with either phentolamine
or guanethidine. Tetrodotoxin (1 μM) also abolished the EFS-induced contractions 
of rabbit CC, but did not affect EFS-induced contractions of Crotalus CC.
Addition of A-803467 (10 μM) did not change the EFS-induced contractions of
Crotalus CC but abolished rabbit CC contractions. 3-iodo-L-Tyrosine and
salsolinol had no effect on EFS-induced contractions of Crotalus CC and Rabbit
CC. Replacement of NaCl by N- Methyl-D-glucamine (NMDG) abolished EFS-induced
contractions of rabbit CC, but did not affect Crotalus CC. The presence of
tyrosine hydroxylase was identified in endothelial cells only of Crotalus CC.
Since the EFS-induced contractions of Crotalus CC is dependent on catecholamine
release, insensitive to TTX, insensitive to A803467 and to NaCl replacement, it
indicates that the source of cathecolamine is unlikely to be from adrenergic
terminals. The finding that tyrosine hydroxylase is present in endothelial cells 
suggests that these cells can modulate Crotalus CC tone.

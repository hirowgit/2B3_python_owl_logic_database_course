Human cooperation is unparalleled in the animal world and rests on an altruistic 
concern for the welfare of genetically unrelated strangers. The evolutionary
roots of human altruism, however, remain poorly understood. Recent evidence
suggests a discontinuity between humans and other primates because individual
chimpanzees do not spontaneously provide food to other group members, indicating 
a lack of concern for their welfare. Here, we demonstrate that common marmoset
monkeys (Callithrix jacchus) do spontaneously provide food to nonreciprocating
and genetically unrelated individuals, indicating that other-regarding
preferences are not unique to humans and that their evolution did not require
advanced cognitive abilities such as theory of mind. Because humans and marmosets
are cooperative breeders and the only two primate taxa in which such unsolicited 
prosociality has been found, we conclude that these prosocial predispositions may
emanate from cooperative breeding.

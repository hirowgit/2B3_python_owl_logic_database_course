This study evaluated JTT-705,
S-[2-([[1-(2-ethylbutyl)cyclohexyl]carbonyl]amino)phenyl]2-methylpropanethioate, 
as a cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitor in several animal
species. In vitro, JTT-705 inhibited plasma CETP activities of humans, rabbits,
hamsters, cynomolgus monkeys and marmosets with IC(50) values of 5.5, 1.0, 11.7, 
2.4 and 6.3 microM, respectively. The thiol form (JTP-25203) also inhibited those
activities with IC(50) values of 2.8, 0.44, 0.52, 1.3 and 1.1 microM,
respectively. Following oral administration to normolipidemic animals (rabbits,
hamsters and marmosets), JTT-705 reduced plasma CETP activity, increased high
density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-cholesterol), and decreased the ratio of
non-HDL-cholesterol to HDL-cholesterol (atherogenic index) in all species. In
marmosets, JTT-705 increased slow alpha-migrating lipoprotein (apolipoprotein
E-rich HDL) in agarose gel electrophoresis, indicating that HDL metabolism in
JTT-705-treated marmosets is similar to that in CETP-deficient humans. These
results indicate that JTT-705 can be expected to inhibit plasma CETP activity and
improve plasma lipoprotein profiles in a wide range of animal species, including 
humans.

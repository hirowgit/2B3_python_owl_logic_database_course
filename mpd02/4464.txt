Callithrix penicillata is a good model for dermatotropic strains of some New
World Leishmania species (L. mexicana mexicana, L. m. amazonensis, and L.
braziliensis guyanensis). Both amastigotes and promastigotes readily infect these
primates, with a relative short period of incubation. The developed lesions
parallel those found in man, and despite the self healing presented by some
marmosets, cell and serum immunological responses are presented. Skin alterations
are confined to the site of inoculum, and visceralization is very rarely found. A
good response to standard antimonial treatment makes the model useful for
preclinical experiments with promising compounds.

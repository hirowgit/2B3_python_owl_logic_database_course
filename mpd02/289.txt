BACKGROUND: Anaesthesia is often required in common marmosets undergoing various 
procedures. The aim of this study was to evaluate anaesthetic and cardiopulmonary
effects of alfaxalone, alfaxalone-ketamine and
alfaxalone-butorphanol-medetomidine in common marmosets.
METHODS: The following treatments were repeatedly administered to seven female
common marmosets: Treatment A, alfaxalone (12 mg kg-1 ) alone; treatment AK,
alfaxalone (1 mg animal-1 ) plus ketamine (2.5 mg animal-1 ); treatment AMB,
alfaxalone (4 mg kg-1 ), medetomidine (50 µg kg-1 ) plus butorphanol (0.3 mg kg-1
); and treatment AMB-Ati, AMB with atipamezole at 45 minutes.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Marmosets became laterally recumbent and unresponsive
for approximately 30 minutes in A and AK and for approximately 60 minutes in AMB.
The animals showed rapid recovery following atipamezole injection in AMB-Ati. The
decrease in heart rate and SpO2 was significantly greater in AMB compared to A
and AK. Oxygen supplementation, anaesthetic monitors and atipamezole should be
available especially when AMB is administered.

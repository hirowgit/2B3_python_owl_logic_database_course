Androgen-dependent, keratinized "spines" occur on the glans penis in many
rodents, primates and other mammals. Since penile spines overlie dermal tactile
receptors, they may play a role in copulatory behaviour. An experiment was
conducted to test this hypothesis. Sixteen sexually experienced adult male
marmosets were paired with ovariectomized females before, and after, removal of
penile spines (using thioglycollate cream applied to the glans under anaesthesia)
or a sham operation. Spine removal resulted in an increased duration of
preintromission pelvic thrusting (mean +/- s.e.m. from 6.87 +/- 1.09 to 14.94 +/-
3.32 s, p = 0.05) and of intromitted thrusting (from 1.73 +/- 0.11 to 2.0 +/-
0.11 s, p less than 0.05). Three males exhibited partial intromissions during
some postspinectomy tests, an effect which had not been observed prior to the
operation. Sham operations had no behavioural effects. Results indicate that
penile spines play a significant (but not indispensible) role in sensory feedback
during copulation in this primate species.

The aim of this study was to determine whether or not sexual maturation is
attained in the family group in captive-born Goeldi's monkey (Callimico goeldii) 
and if so, at what age and body weight. To monitor ovarian activity in 14 female 
Goeldi's monkeys, urinary content of pregnanediol-3alpha-glucuronide (PdG) was
determined using radioimmunoassay. Urinary samples were collected between the
ages of 6 and 70 weeks. Subjects became sexually mature while still housed in
their family groups, at a median age of 57 weeks (48-< 70 weeks). Median body
weight at the age of sexual maturity was 473 g (N=10; 420-543 g). This
corresponded to 90% of the median non-pregnant body weight of breeding females in
our colony (526 g, N=8). Therefore, Goeldi's monkey is similar to Leontopithecus 
but different from Cebuella, Callithrix, and Saguinus, in terms of daughters
ovulating in the family group and at a relatively young age.

We have established that two very closely homologous human sorbitol dehydrogenase
sequences lie within 0.5 Mb on Chromosome 15. We have defined the relative
orientation of SORD1 and SORD2 genes with respect to both the centromere and each
other and established their exact chromosome location. In addition, we have
identified polymorphic variants in the locus, which may be useful, in association
studies to predict predisposition to clinical problems resulting from decreased
conversion of cellular sorbitol to fructose. To define the evolutionary
relationship of these human genes, SORD from the marmoset was also sequenced for 
comparison. Marmoset SORD, which appears to be a single gene in this species,
shows significantly less homology with either SORD1 or SORD2 than they do with
each other, suggesting that the human homologs represent a recent gene
duplication event. A hypothesis is presented to explain the retention of the
redundant SORD2 sequence in the human genome.

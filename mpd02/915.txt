Generation of nonhuman primate models of human disease conditions will foster the
development of novel therapeutic strategies. Callithrix jacchus, or the common
marmoset, is a New World, nonhuman primate species that exhibits great
reproductive fitness in captivity with an ovarian cycle that can be easily
managed with pharmacological agents. This characteristic, among others, provides 
an opportunity to employ assisted reproductive technologies to generate embryos
that can be genetically manipulated to create a variety of nonhuman primate
models for human disease. Here, we review methods to synchronize the marmoset
ovarian cycle and stimulate oocyte donors, and compare various protocols for in
vitro production of embryos. In light of advances in genomic editing, recent
approaches used to generate transgenic or genetically edited embryos in the
marmoset and also future perspective are reviewed.

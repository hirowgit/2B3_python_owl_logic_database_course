To study whether HLA-DR haplotypes associated with susceptibility to develop
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) may influence T-cell responses to the Epstein-Barr
virus (EBV) gp110 (a protein of the late replicative cycle of EBV), we evaluated 
the frequency in peripheral blood of T cells capable to proliferate to EBV gp110 
by direct limiting dilution analysis in 50 HLA-DR-typed healthy subjects. NVe
found that HLA-DRB1*07, an allele associated with reduced risk to develop RA, is 
associated with the highest frequencies of T cells specific for gp110 in
peripheral blood. In contrast, HLA-DRB1*0404, one of the susceptibility alleles
is associated with the lowest frequencies of gp110 specific T cells. Finally,
people expressing both HLA-DRB1*07 and HLA-DRB1*0404 display low precursor
frequencies to EBV gp110.

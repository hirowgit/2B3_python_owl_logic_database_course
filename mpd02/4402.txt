The selective dopamine D-2 receptor agonist N-0437 produced a rapid and
dose-dependent reversal of motor deficits lasting 90-120 min following i.p. or
oral administration of the racemate to MPTP-treated common marmosets. In
contrast, topical application of (+/-)-, (+)- or (-)-N-0437 to the skin of
MPTP-treated animals did not alter locomotor activity in the initial 4 h although
other motor disabilities were reduced. However, 24 h following application of the
racemate or the (-) enantiomer both locomotor activity and the other motor
deficits induced by MPTP were improved. The increase in locomotor activity
returned to basal values by 48-52 h following application of the racemate to the 
skin and by 72-76 h following administration of (-)-N-0437; the other motor
deficits induced by MPTP were reduced for up to 72-76 h by both (+/-)- and
(-)-N-0437. Application to skin of the (+) enantiomer produced no behavioural
improvement or stimulation of locomotor activity. Transdermal administration of
the active enantiomer of N-0437 may be of value in producing a prolonged reversal
of parkinsonian motor deficits in man.

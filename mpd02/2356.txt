In the marmoset monkey, the LHR type II, lacking exon 10, is the native receptor 
type. We characterised the LHR splicing pattern in marmoset testes and the
adrenals during puberty and in pre- and postpubertal ovaries and quantified mRNA 
LHR expression in the testis. We detected 11 LHR splicing variants expressed at
similar levels and generated by exon skipping and/or usage of cryptic splice
sites. No preferred splicing variant during pubertal maturation was observed in
both sexes. Testicular and adrenal LHR expression levels did not significantly
change with age. However, a significant increase during pubertal maturation for
the serum testosterone/LHR ratio indicated that testosterone secretion increases 
in the presence of constant LHR mRNA expression levels. We conclude that LHR
splicing in the marmoset displays a homogenous pattern and that the main function
of the LHR is established in the testis, reaching its highest efficiency during
pubertal maturation.

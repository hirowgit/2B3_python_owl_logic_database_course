The neocortex has expanded during mammalian evolution. Overexpression studies in 
developing mouse and ferret neocortex have implicated the human-specific gene
ARHGAP11B in neocortical expansion, but the relevance for primate evolution has
been unclear. Here, we provide functional evidence that ARHGAP11B causes
expansion of the primate neocortex. ARHGAP11B expressed in fetal neocortex of the
common marmoset under control of the gene's own (human) promoter increased the
numbers of basal radial glia progenitors in the marmoset outer subventricular
zone, increased the numbers of upper-layer neurons, enlarged the neocortex, and
induced its folding. Thus, the human-specific ARHGAP11B drives changes in
development in the nonhuman primate marmoset that reflect the changes in
evolution that characterize human neocortical development.

We investigated the effects of the human renin inhibitor, ES-8891, and captopril 
on renal renin secretion and storage in the marmoset. Either ES-8891 (30 mg/kg)
or captopril (2 mg/kg) was given orally twice a day for 1 week to conscious,
sodium-depleted marmosets (n = 6 for each group). The ES-8891-treated group
displayed a significant reduction in mean arterial pressure (MAP), plasma renin
activity (PRA) and plasma immunoreactive renin (PIR) compared with the control
group. Kidney renin content was significantly increased compared with the control
group and enlarged renin granules containing heterogenous internum were observed 
in juxtaglomerular cells after treatment with ES-8891. Treatment with captopril
significantly increased PRA and PIR compared with the control day as well as
increasing kidney renin content and the number of renin granules with crystalline
content in juxtaglomerular cells compared with the control group. These results
suggest that ES-8891 inhibits both PRA and renin secretion from the kidney,
resulting in an increase in renal renin storage.

One form of cytochrome P-450 from phenobarbital-induced marmoset liver was
purified to apparent electrophoretic homogeneity and compared with the major
inducible form isolated from rat liver. Whereas spectral properties and molecular
weights, as well as catalytic activities towards aminopyrine and ethylmorphine
N-demethylation are quite similar, rates of O-dealkylation with enzymes from the 
two species are considerably different. While ethoxycoumarin deethylation for the
marmoset cytochrome is about one-fortieth of that for the rat, ethoxyresorufin
and even pentoxyresorufin dealkylations for the marmoset form are not detectable.
By contrast, aldrin epoxidation as catalyzed by this cytochrome is about three
times as high as that obtained from the rat.

BACKGROUND: The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is one of the most studied
Neotropical primates regarding reproduction. However, little has been reported on
the black-tufted-ear marmoset (Callithrix penicillata), which may produce fertile
hybrids with other Callithrix. This is the first study to evaluate sperm freezing
from black-tufted-ear marmoset.
METHODS: Testicles from all animals were measured, and semen was collected by
penile vibrostimulation. Samples were analyzed after collection, after chilling
and addition of glycerol, and after thawing.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Fresh semen from both species was similar in many
aspects. Additionally, there is a relationship between total motility, plasma
membrane integrity, and acrosome integrity observed in sperm samples from both
species. We managed to evaluate fresh and thawed sperm with suitable methods for 
use under zoo or field conditions. However, TEST egg yolk with glycerol at 4% and
6% concentration was not effective for sperm protection in both species during
cryopreservation.

The authors explored whether prolactin is associated with paternal care in 3
monkey species: titi monkey (Callicebus cupreus), common marmoset (Callithrix
jacchus), and Goeldi's monkey (Callimico goeldii). They compared prolactin levels
in fathers before and after infant birth as well as between fathers and
nonfathers. C. cupreus fathers carry infants almost exclusively, have higher
prolactin levels than nonfathers, but show no prolactin increase after infant
birth. C. goeldii fathers carry infants only after 3 weeks, show an increase in
prolactin levels during the precarrying period, but do not have higher levels
than nonfathers. C jacchus fathers are the primary carriers, have higher
prolactin levels than nonfathers, and show a trend for a prolactin increase after
the birth of infants. In conclusion, species differences in the patterns of
prolactin secretion were evident and reflect the different paternal roles.

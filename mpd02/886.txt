The corpus callosum (CC) is present in all primate brains and is the major white 
matter tract connecting the cerebral hemispheres for integration of sensory,
motor and higher-order cognitive information. The midsagittal area of the CC has 
frequently been used as a sensitive biomarker of brain development. Although the 
marmoset has been considered as an alternative non-human primate model for
neuroscience research, the developmental patterns of the CC have not been
explored. The present longitudinal study of magnetic resonance imaging
demonstrated that marmosets show a rapid increase of CC during infancy, followed 
by a slow increase during the juvenile stage, as observed in chimpanzees and
humans. Marmosets also show a tendency toward a greater increase in CC during
late infancy and the juvenile stage, as observed in humans, but not in
chimpanzees. However, several differences between marmosets and humans were
identified. There was a tendency toward a greater maturation of the human CC
during early infancy. Furthermore, there was a tendency toward a greater increase
during late infancy and the juvenile stage in marmosets, compared to that
observed in chimpanzees and humans. These differences in the developmental
trajectories of the CC may be related to evolutional changes in social behavior.

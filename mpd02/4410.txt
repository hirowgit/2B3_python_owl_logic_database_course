The presence of protein(s) which is immunologically and functionally similar to
the well characterised avian riboflavin carrier protein has been demonstrated in 
female common marmosets during pregnancy. The protein(s) that interacts with
[14C]riboflavin has an immunological homology to chicken riboflavin carrier
protein. The termination of pregnancy in four out of six marmosets following
administration of antiserum to chicken riboflavin carrier protein supports the
hypothesis that vitamin carrier protein ensures an uninterrupted supply of the
vitamin to the growing embryo and that immunoneutralization of maternal
riboflavin carrier protein leads to fetal death and termination of pregnancy.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex multisystem, chronic and so far incurable
disease with significant unmet medical needs. The incidence of PD increases with 
aging and the expected burden will continue to escalate with our aging
population. Since its discovery in the 1961 levodopa has remained the gold
standard pharmacotherapy for PD. However, the progressive nature of the
neurodegenerative process in and beyond the nigrostriatal system causes a
multitude of side effects, including levodopa-induced dyskinesia within 5 years
of therapy. Attenuating dyskinesia has been a significant challenge in the
clinical management of PD. We report on a small molecule that eliminates the
expression of levodopa-induced dyskinesia and significantly improves PD-like
symptoms. The lead compound PD13R we discovered is a dopamine D3 receptor partial
agonist with high affinity and selectivity, orally active and with desirable
drug-like properties. Future studies are aimed at developing this lead compound
for treating PD patients with dyskinesia.

Dyskinesia and psychosis are complications encountered in advanced Parkinson's
disease (PD) following long-term therapy with L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine
(L-DOPA). Disturbances in the glutamatergic system have been associated with both
dyskinesia and psychosis, making glutamatergic modulation a potential therapeutic
approach for these. Treatments thus far have sought to dampen glutamatergic
transmission, for example through blockade of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)
receptors or modulation of metabotropic glutamate receptors 5. In contrast,
activation of the glycine-binding site on NMDA receptors is required for their
physiological response. Here, we investigated whether indirectly enhancing
glutamatergic transmission through inhibition of glycine re-uptake would be
efficacious in diminishing both dyskinesia and psychosis-like behaviours (PLBs)
in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-lesioned common
marmoset. Six marmosets were rendered parkinsonian by MPTP injection. Following
repeated administration of L-DOPA to induce dyskinesia and PLBs, they underwent
acute challenges of the glycine transporter 1 (GlyT1) inhibitor ALX-5407 (0.01,
0.1 and 1 mg/kg) or vehicle, in combination with L-DOPA, after which the severity
of dyskinesia, PLBs and parkinsonian disability was evaluated. In combination
with L-DOPA, ALX-5407 0.1 and 1 mg/kg significantly reduced the severity of
dyskinesia, by 51% and 41% (both P < 0.001), when compared to vehicle. ALX-5407
0.01, 0.1 and 1 mg/kg also decreased the severity of global PLBs, by 25%, 51% and
38% (all P < 0.001), when compared to vehicle. The benefits on dyskinesia and
PLBs were achieved without compromising the therapeutic effect of L-DOPA on
parkinsonism. Our results suggest that GlyT1 inhibition may be a novel strategy
to attenuate dyskinesia and PLBs in PD, without interfering with L-DOPA
anti-parkinsonian action.

Antagonising the serotonin 2A (5-HT2A) receptor is an efficacious way to
alleviate dyskinesia and psychosis in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, previous
research indicates that there might be a limit to the effects conferred by this
approach. 5-HT2A receptors were shown to form hetero-dimers with metabotropic
glutamate 2 (mGlu2) receptors, in which 5-HT2A blockade and mGlu2 activation
elicit equivalent effects at the downstream signalling level. We have previously 
shown that mGlu2 activation reduces both dyskinesia and psychosis-like behaviours
(PLBs) induced by L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA), in the
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-lesioned primate. Here, we
hypothesised that concurrent 5-HT2A antagonism and mGlu2 activation would provide
greater anti-dyskinetic and anti-psychotic benefits than either approach alone.
We conducted 3 series of experiments in the MPTP-lesioned marmoset. In the first 
series of experiments, the mGlu2 positive allosteric modulator LY-487,379 and the
5-HT2A antagonist EMD-281,014, either alone or in combination, were added to
l-DOPA. In the second series of experiments, the mGlu2/3 orthosteric agonist
LY-354,740 and EMD-281,014, either alone or in combination, were added to l-DOPA.
In the last series of experiments, we investigated whether mGlu2 blockade would
diminish the effects of antagonising 5-HT2A receptors. To this end, the mGlu2/3
orthosteric antagonist LY-341,495 and EMD-281,014, either alone or in
combination, were added to l-DOPA. We found that the anti-dyskinetic effect of
the combination LY-487,379/EMD-281,014 was greater than the ones conferred by
LY-487,379 (by 35%, P < 0.05) and EMD-281,014 (by 38%, P < 0.01). The
anti-dyskinetic and anti-psychotic effects of the combination
LY-354,740/EMD-281,014 were also greater than the ones conferred by LY-354,740
(by 57% for dyskinesia and 54% for PLBs, both P < 0.001) and EMD-281,014 (by 61% 
for dyskinesia and 53% for PLBs, both P < 0.001). The anti-parkinsonian action of
l-DOPA was maintained with all treatments. Lastly, the addition of LY-341,495
abolished the therapeutic effects of EMD-281,014 on dyskinesia and PLBs. Our
results suggest that mGlu2 activation may enhance the anti-dyskinetic and
anti-psychotic effects of 5-HT2A blockade and could provide relief to PD patients
with dyskinesia and psychotic symptoms beyond what can be achieved with current
therapies.

The pathological changes underlying gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction in
Parkinson's disease (PD) are poorly understood and the symptoms remain
inadequately treated. In this study we compared the functional and neurochemical 
changes in the enteric nervous system in the colon of adult, L-DOPA-responsive,
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated common marmoset, with
naïve controls. Measurement of mucosal vectorial ion transport, spontaneous
longitudinal smooth muscle activity and immunohistochemical assessment of
intrinsic innervation were each performed in discrete colonic regions of naïve
and MPTP-treated marmosets. The basal short circuit current (Isc) was lower in
MPTP-treated colonic mucosa while mucosal resistance was unchanged. There was no 
difference in basal cholinergic tone, however, there was an increased excitatory 
cholinergic response in MPTP-treated tissues when NOS was blocked with
L-Nω-nitroarginine. The amplitude and frequency of spontaneous contractions in
longitudinal smooth muscle as well as carbachol-evoked post-junctional
contractile responses were unaltered, despite a decrease in choline
acetyltransferase and an increase in the vasoactive intestinal polypeptide neuron
numbers per ganglion in the proximal colon. There was a low-level inflammation in
the proximal but not the distal colon accompanied by a change in α-synuclein
immunoreactivity. This study suggests that MPTP treatment produces long-term
alterations in colonic mucosal function associated with amplified muscarinic
mucosal activity but decreased cholinergic innervation in myenteric plexi and
increased nitrergic enteric neurotransmission. This suggests that long-term
changes in either central or peripheral dopaminergic neurotransmission may lead
to adaptive changes in colonic function resulting in alterations in ion transport
across mucosal epithelia that may result in GI dysfunction in PD.

In Parkinson's disease (PD), management of L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine
(l-DOPA)-related complications, such as l-DOPA induced dyskinesia and psychosis, 
remains inadequate, which poses a significant burden on the quality of life of
patients. We have shown, in the hemi-parkinsonian rat model of PD, that the
selective serotonin type 3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonists ondansetron and
granisetron decreased the severity of established dyskinesia, and ondansetron
even attenuated the development of dyskinesia. Here, we seek to confirm these
favourable data on dyskinesia and to explore the effect of ondansetron on the
severity of psychosis-like behaviours (PLBs) in the gold standard model of PD,
the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-lesioned non-human
primate. We first determined the pharmacokinetic profile of ondansetron in the
marmoset. Subsequently, six MPTP-lesioned marmosets were administered l-DOPA
chronically until they exhibited stable and reproducible dyskinesia and PLBs upon
each administration of l-DOPA. On behavioural assessment days, ondansetron (0.01,
0.1 and 1 mg/kg) or vehicle was administered in conjunction with l-DOPA, and the 
severity of dyskinesia, PLBs and parkinsonism was evaluated. Ondansetron
0.1 mg/kg alleviated global dyskinesia severity by 73% (P < 0.0001) and decreased
duration of on-time with disabling dyskinesia by 88% (P = 0.0491). Ondansetron
0.1 mg/kg reduced the severity of global PLBs by 80% (P < 0.0001) and suppressed 
on-time with disabling PLBs (P = 0.0213). Ondansetron enhanced the
anti-parkinsonian action of l-DOPA, reducing global parkinsonism by 53% compared 
to l-DOPA (P = 0.0004). These results suggest that selective blockade of the
5-HT3 receptor with ondansetron may be an effective approach to alleviate
l-DOPA-related complications.

The 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-lesioned common marmoset 
has been used extensively to model Parkinson's disease,
L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA)-induced dyskinesia and, more recently,
dopaminergic psychosis. Whereas several experimental drugs have been tested in
this primate, many of which subsequently underwent clinical trials, efficacy
thresholds in the marmoset that would predict efficacy in the clinic are lacking.
Here, we aimed to determine such efficacy end points that would be indicative of 
likely efficacy in clinical studies. To do so, we used the evidence-based
medicine reviews published by the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder
Society (IPMDS) to select drugs that were rated as clinically efficacious, likely
efficacious or not efficacious for the treatment of parkinsonism, dyskinesia and 
psychosis. We then reviewed the literature in the MPTP-lesioned marmoset and
identified articles reporting the effects of drugs that were included in the
IPMDS recommendations, following which we estimated efficacy thresholds in the
marmoset that would predict efficacy at the clinical level. We propose that, when
drugs are administered as monotherapy, ≥ 50% reduction of global parkinsonism may
be necessary to predict the possibility of clinical efficacy. As adjunct to a low
dose of L-DOPA, we propose that an additional reduction of global
parkinsonism ≥ 25% might predict clinical efficacy. As adjunct to an optimal dose
of L-DOPA, we propose that additional anti-parkinsonian benefit ≥ 20%, with
global parkinsonism as the end point, might predict clinical efficacy. For the
treatment of dyskinesia, we suggest that the predictability threshold be set
at ≥ 25% reduction of peak dose dyskinesia, while we believe that this threshold 
should be > 50% reduction of peak dose psychosis-like behaviours for
psychosis-related end points. This article represents the first step in
determining what efficacy might be necessary to achieve in pre-clinical studies
in the MPTP-lesioned marmoset prior to confidently advancing drugs to clinical
trials. We hope that it will help in the drug discovery and development process, 
notably by avoiding exposing patients to drugs that have little probability of
clinical efficacy based upon pre-clinical experiments.

BACKGROUND: Long-term treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) with l-DOPA typically
leads to development of l-DOPA induced dyskinesia (LID). Amantadine, an NMDA
antagonist, attenuates LID, but with limited efficacy and considerable
side-effects. NLX-112 (also known as befiradol or F13640), a highly selective and
efficacious 5-HT1A receptor agonist, reduced LID when tested in rodent and
marmoset models of PD.
METHODS: The effects of NLX-112 (0.03, 0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg PO) on established LID
evoked by acute challenge with l-DOPA (27.5 ± 3.8 mg/kg PO) were assessed in
MPTP-treated cynomolgus macaques. Amantadine (10 mg/kg PO) was tested as a
positive control. Plasma exposure of NLX-112 (0.1 mg/kg PO) was determined.
RESULTS: NLX-112 significantly and dose-dependently reduced median LID levels by 
up to 96% during the first hour post-administration (0.3 mg/kg). Moreover,
NLX-112 reduced the duration of 'bad on-time' associated with disabling LID by up
to 48% (0.3 mg/kg). In contrast, NLX-112 had negligible impact on the
anti-parkinsonian benefit of l-DOPA. NLX-112 exposure peaked at ~50 ng/ml at
30 min post-administration but decreased to ~15 ng/ml at 2h. Amantadine reduced
by 42% 'bad on-time' associated with l-DOPA, thereby validating the model.
CONCLUSION: These data show that, in MPTP-lesioned cynomolgus macaques, NLX-112
exerts robust anti-dyskinetic effects, without reducing the anti-parkinsonian
benefit of l-DOPA. These observations complement previous findings and suggest
that selective and high efficacy activation of 5-HT1A receptors by NLX-112 may
constitute a promising approach to combat LID in PD, providing an alternative for
patients in whom amantadine is poorly tolerated or without useful effect.

MPTP-Treated Marmosets.

BACKGROUND: Increased firing across glutamatergic synapses may contribute to both
the motor dysfunction and L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia seen in Parkinson's disease. 
Given their ability to reduce glutamate release, activation of group III
metabotropic glutamate receptors such as metabotropic glutamate receptor 4 may
prove effective against both motor dysfunction and dyskinesia in Parkinson's
disease.
OBJECTIVE: We hypothesised that activation of metabotropic glutamate receptor 4
by an orthosteric agonist
((2S)-2-amino-4-(hydroxy(hydroxy(4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-5-nitrophenyl)methyl)phospho
ryl)butanoic acid, LSP1-2111) would produce antiparkinsonian activity and reduce 
expression of dyskinesia in a 1-methyl-4-phenyl,1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine
(MPTP)-treated marmoset model of Parkinson's disease.
METHODS: Common marmosets were previously treated with MPTP and pre-primed with
L-DOPA for up to 28 days to express dyskinesia. LSP1-2111 (1, 3, or 6 mg/kg s.c.)
or vehicle (0.9% saline s.c.) were administered immediately prior to L-DOPA
(8 mg/kg + benserazide (10 mg/kg) p.o.) or vehicle (10% sucrose p.o.). Locomotor 
activity was measured in automated test cages and animals were scored for
dyskinesia and disability.
RESULTS: As expected, L-DOPA reversed motor disability and induced moderate
dyskinesia. By contrast, LSP1-2111 alone significantly reduced the motor
disability without any accompanying expression of dyskinesia. When administered
in combination with L-DOPA, LSP1-2111 did not significantly reduce the severity
of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia.
CONCLUSION: Systemic administration of LSP1-2111 reduces motor disability without
causing dyskinesia in MPTP-treated marmosets, supporting a role for metabotropic 
glutamate receptor 4 orthosteric agonists as promising monotherapy for PD.
Conversely, this study found no evidence to support their use as antidyskinetic
agents within the dose range tested.

Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) G2019S is a relatively common mutation,
associated with 1-3% of Parkinson's disease (PD) cases worldwide. G2019S is
hypothesized to increase LRRK2 kinase activity. Dopaminergic neurons derived from
induced pluripotent stem cells of PD patients carrying LRRK2 G2019S are reported 
to have several phenotypes compared to wild type controls, including increased
activated caspase-3 and reactive oxygen species (ROS), autophagy dysfunction, and
simplification of neurites. The common marmoset is envisioned as a candidate
nonhuman primate species for comprehensive modeling of genetic mutations. Here,
we report our successful use of CRISPR/Cas9 with repair template-mediated
homology directed repair to introduce the LRRK2 G2019S mutation, as well as a
truncation of the LRRK2 kinase domain, into marmoset embryonic and induced
pluripotent stem cells. We found that, similar to humans, marmoset LRRK2 G2019S
resulted in elevated kinase activity. Phenotypic evaluation after dopaminergic
differentiation demonstrated LRRK2 G2019S-mediated increased intracellular ROS,
decreased neuronal viability, and reduced neurite complexity. Importantly, these 
phenotypes were not observed in clones with LRRK2 truncation. These results
demonstrate the feasibility of inducing monogenic mutations in common marmosets
and support the use of this species for generating a novel genetic-based model of
PD that expresses physiological levels of LRRK2 G2019S.

l-DOPA is the gold-standard pharmacotherapy for treatment of Parkinson's disease 
(PD) but can lead to the appearance of troubling dyskinesia which are
attributable to 'false neurotransmitter' release of dopamine by serotonergic
neurons. Reducing the activity of these neurons diminishes l-DOPA-induced
dyskinesia (LID), but there are currently no clinically approved selective, high 
efficacy 5-HT1A receptor agonists. Here we describe the effects of NLX-112, a
highly selective and efficacious 5-HT1A receptor agonist, on LID in
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated marmosets, a
non-human primate model of PD. NLX-112 exhibited modest plasma half-life (~2h)
and marked plasma protein binding (96%). When administered to parkinsonian
marmosets with l-DOPA (7 mg/kg p.o.), NLX-112 (0.025, 0.1 and 0.4 mg/kg p.o.)
reduced LID scores at early time-points after administration, whilst only
minimally interfering with the l-DOPA-induced reversal of motor disability. In
contrast, the prototypical 5-HT1A receptor agonist, (+)8-OH-DPAT (0.6 and 2 mg/kg
p. o.), reduced LID but also abolished l-DOPA's anti-disability activity.
Administered by itself, NLX-112 (0.1, 0.2 mg/kg p.o.) produced very little
dyskinesia or locomotor activity, but reduced motor disability scores by about
half the extent elicited by l-DOPA, suggesting that it may have motor
facilitation effects of its own. Both NLX-112 and (+)8-OH-DPAT induced unusual
and dose-limiting behaviors in marmoset that resembled 'serotonin behavioral
syndrome' observed previously in rat. Overall, the present study showed that
NLX-112 has anti-LID activity at the doses tested as well as reducing motor
disability. The data suggest that additional investigation of NLX-112 is
desirable to explore its potential as a treatment for PD and PD-LID.

Psychosis and dyskinesia significantly diminish the quality of life of patients
with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD). Available treatment options are
unfortunately few and their use is limited by adverse effects. We have recently
shown that activation of metabotropic glutamate 2 and 3 (mGlu2/3) receptors
produced significant relief of L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA)-induced
psychosis-like behaviours (PLBs) and dyskinesia in experimental models of PD.
Here, using the highly-selective mGlu2 positive allosteric modulator (PAM)
LY-487,379, we seek to determine the contribution of selective mGlu2 activation
on both L-DOPA-induced PLBs and dyskinesia, in the
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-lesioned primate. We first
determined the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of LY-487,379 in the common marmoset,
following which we administered it (0.1, 1 and 10 mg/kg) or its vehicle to 6
MPTP-lesioned marmosets previously exposed to L-DOPA to elicit stable PLBs and
dyskinesia. We found that LY-487,379 provided a ≈45% reduction of the global PLBs
observed and reduced global dyskinesia score by ≈ 55%. Moreover, LY-487,379
enhanced the anti-parkinsonian effect of L-DOPA, by reducing global parkinsonian 
score by ≈ 15%. Our data suggest that selective mGlu2 positive allosteric
modulation with LY-487,379 may represent a potential therapeutic approach to
alleviate both L-DOPA-induced PLBs and dyskinesia in PD.

l-3,4-Dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA) is the most effective treatment for
Parkinson's disease (PD), but its use over a long period is marred by motors
complications such as dyskinesia. We previously demonstrated that selective
metabotropic glutamate 2/3 (mGlu2/3 ) receptor activation with LY-354,740
alleviates dyskinesia in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine
(MPTP)-lesioned marmoset and the 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-lesioned rat. Here,
we sought to determine the role played by selective mGlu2 activation in the
anti-dyskinetic effect of mGlu2/3 stimulation and have investigated the effect of
the highly selective mGlu2 positive allosteric modulator LY-487,379 at
alleviating established, and preventing the development of, l-DOPA-induced
dyskinesia in the 6-OHDA-lesioned rat. First, dyskinetic 6-OHDA-lesioned rats
were administered l-DOPA in combination with LY-487,379 (0.1, 1 and 10 mg/kg) or 
vehicle, and the severity of dyskinesia was determined. Second, 6-OHDA-lesioned
rats were administered LY-487,379 (0.1 or 1 mg/kg), started concurrently with
l-DOPA, once daily for 22 days, and dyskinesia severity was evaluated weekly for 
four consecutive weeks. We also assessed the effect of LY-487,379 on l-DOPA
anti-parkinsonian effect. We found that acute challenges of LY-487,379 0.1 mg/kg 
in combination with l-DOPA, significantly diminished dyskinesia severity, by ≈54%
(p < .01), when compared to vehicle. Moreover, animals treated with
l-DOPA/LY-487,379 0.1 and 1 mg/kg during the dyskinesia induction phase exhibited
milder dyskinesia, by ≈74% and ≈61%, respectively (both p < .01), when compared
to l-DOPA/vehicle. LY-487,379 did not impair l-DOPA anti-parkinsonian activity.
These results suggest that mGlu2 activation may be an effective and promising
therapeutic strategy to alleviate the severity and prevent the development of
dyskinesia.

Baseline locomotion and behavioral traits in the common marmoset Parkinson's
disease model were examined to provide basic information for preclinical
evaluations of medical treatments. A single regimen of
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine at a cumulative dose of 5 mg/kg as
the free base over three consecutive days was administered subcutaneously to 10
marmosets. Data obtained from these marmosets were compared to
pre-1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine levels or
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine free marmosets. After the single
regimen, reduced daily locomotion, a measure of immobility (a primary sign of
Parkinsonism), was observed for more than a year. A moving tremor was also
observed by visual inspection during this period. When apomorphine (0.13 mg/kg,
s.c.) was administered, either right or left circling behavior was observed in a 
cylindrical chamber in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine marmosets,
suggestive of unequal neural damage between the two brain hemispheres to
different extents. MRI revealed that T1 relaxation time in the right substantia
nigra correlated with right circling in
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine marmosets. Histology was supportive 
of dopaminergic neural loss in the striatum. These results increase our
understanding of the utility and limitations of the Parkinson's disease model in 
marmosets with a single 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine regimen, and
provide reference data for efficacious preclinical evaluations.

Selective blockade of serotonin 2A (5-HT2A) receptors is a promising strategy to 
reduce L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA)-induced dyskinesia and has shown
efficacy in a Phase III clinical trial for dopaminergic psychosis in Parkinson's 
disease (PD). However, pre-clinical and clinical evidence suggest that, while
this approach may be effective and well tolerated, there might be a ceiling
beyond which no further therapeutic benefit might be achieved. There is mounting 
evidence that 5-HT2A receptors form a functional hetero-complex with metabotropic
glutamate 2 (mGlu2) receptors, with antagonism of 5-HT2A receptors and activation
of mGlu2 receptors producing similar effects on the Gi/Gq signalling ratio at the
intra-cellular level. Based on this interaction between 5-HT2A and mGlu2
receptors, we hypothesised that activation of mGlu2 receptors would alleviate
dyskinesia and psychosis in PD. LY-354,740 is a selective mGlu2/3 orthosteric
agonist that was previously tested in the clinic. In experiments conducted in the
6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-lesioned rat and the
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-lesioned marmoset, we found
that mGlu2/3 activation with LY-354,740 significantly reduced the expression of
dyskinesia and psychosis-like behaviours, while simultaneously enhancing l-DOPA
therapeutic benefit. Moreover, mGlu2/3 activation with LY-354,740 attenuated the 
development of dyskinesia. These data indicate that activation of mGlu2/3
receptors is a therapeutic strategy that may provide relief for both motor
and-non-motor treatment-related complications in PD.

α-Synuclein (αS) is the major component of the filamentous inclusions that
constitute the defining characteristic of neurodegenerative synucleinopathies,
including Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and multiple system
atrophy. αS is deposited in a hyperphosphorylated and ubiquitinated form with a
β-sheet-rich fibrillar structure in diseased brains. In 2008, some researchers
reported that embryonic neurons transplanted into Parkinson's disease brains had 
Lewy body-like pathologies, suggesting that pathological αS propagates from
diseased neurons to young neurons. Subsequently, a growing body of evidence
supported the cell-to-cell spread of αS pathologies. Recent studies have revealed
that intracerebral injection of insoluble αS into wild-type mice can induce
prion-like propagation of phosphorylated αS pathology even 1 month after
injection, while injection into αS-knockout mice failed to induce any pathology. 
We also showed that intracerebral injection of insoluble αS into adult common
marmoset brains results in the spreading of abundant αS pathology. These in vivo 
experiments clearly indicate that insoluble αS has prion-like properties and that
it propagates through neural networks. The underlying mechanisms of αS
propagation are still poorly understood, but αS propagation model animals could
be helpful in elucidating the pathogenetic mechanisms and developing drugs for
synucleinopathies.

Neurological compensatory mechanisms help our brain to adjust to
neurodegeneration as in Parkinson's disease. It is suggested that the
compensation of the damaged striato-thalamo-cortical circuit is focused on the
intact thalamo-rubro-cerebellar pathway as seen during presymptomatic Parkinson, 
paradoxical movement and sensorimotor rhythm (SMR). Indeed, the size of the red
nucleus, connecting the cerebellum with the cerebral cortex, is larger in
Parkinson's disease patients suggesting an increased activation of this brain
area. Therefore, the red nucleus was examined in MPTP-induced parkinsonian
marmoset monkeys during the presymptomatic stage and after SMR activation by
neurofeedback training. We found a reverse significant correlation between the
early expression of parkinsonian signs and the size of the parvocellular part of 
the red nucleus, which is predominantly present in human and non-human primates. 
In quadrupedal animals it consists mainly of the magnocellular part. Furthermore,
SMR activation, that mitigated parkinsonian signs, further increased the size of 
the red nucleus in the marmoset monkey. This plasticity of the brain helps to
compensate for dysfunctional movement control and can be a promising target for
compensatory treatment with neurofeedback technology, vibrotactile stimulation or
DBS in order to improve the quality of life for Parkinson's disease patients.

L-3,4-Dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) is the most effective therapy for motor
symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD); however, with repeated administration, as
many as 94% of PD patients develop complications such as L-DOPA-induced
dyskinesia. We previously demonstrated that EMD-281,014, a highly selective
serotonin 2A (5-HT2A) receptor antagonist, reduces the severity of dyskinesia in 
the parkinsonian marmoset, without interfering with L-DOPA anti-parkinsonian
benefit. Here, we assessed the effects of EMD-281,014 on L-DOPA-induced abnormal 
involuntary movements (AIMs) in the 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-lesioned rat. We
first determined the pharmacokinetic profile of EMD-281,014, to administer doses 
leading to clinically relevant plasma levels in the behavioural experiments.
Dyskinetic 6-OHDA-lesioned rats were then administered EMD-281,014 (0.01, 0.03
and 0.1 mg/kg) or vehicle in combination with L-DOPA and AIMs severity was
evaluated. We also assessed the effect of EMD-281,014 on L-DOPA anti-parkinsonian
action with the cylinder test. We found that the addition of EMD-281,014 (0.01,
0.03 and 0.1 mg/kg) to L-DOPA did not reduce AIMs severity (P > 0.05), when
compared to vehicle. EMD-281,014 did not compromise L-DOPA anti-parkinsonian
action. Our results suggest that the highly selective 5-HT2A receptor antagonist 
EMD-281,014 is well-tolerated by parkinsonian rats, but does not attenuate
L-DOPA-induced AIMs. Our results highlight differences between rodent and primate
models of PD when it comes to determining the anti-dyskinetic action of 5-HT2A
receptor antagonists.

Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease increasingly
affecting our aging population. Remarkable advances have been made in developing 
novel therapies to control symptoms, halt or cure the disease, ranging from
physiotherapy and small molecules to cell and gene therapy. This progress was
enabled by the existence of reliable animal models. The nonhuman primate model of
Parkinson's disease emulates the cardinal symptoms of the disease, including
tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, postural instability, freezing and cognitive
impairment. However, this model is established through the specific loss of
midbrain dopaminergic neurons, while our current knowledge reflects the reality
of Parkinson's disease as a multisystem disease. Parkinson's disease involves
both motor and non-motor symptoms, such as sleep disturbance, olfaction,
gastrointestinal dysfunctions, depression and cognitive deficits. Some of the
non-motor symptoms emerge earlier at the prodromal phase and worsen with disease 
progression, yet in basic and translational studies, they are rarely considered
as endpoints. In this study, we set to characterize an ensemble of less described
motor and non-motor dysfunctions in the marmoset MPTP
(1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) model. We provide evidence that
this animal model expresses postural head tremor and a progressive worsening of
fine motor skills, movement coordination and cognitive abilities over a 6-month
period. We report for the first time a non-invasive approach showing detailed
analysis of daytime and nighttime sleep and circadian rhythm disturbance
remarkably similar to Parkinson's disease patients. This study describes the
incidence of tremors, motor and non-motor dysfunctions in a preclinical model and
highlights the need for their consideration in translating effective new
therapeutic approaches for Parkinson's disease.

Blockade of serotonin 2A (5-HT2A) receptors is regarded as an anti-dyskinetic and
anti-psychotic strategy in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the 5-HT2A
antagonists tested so far exhibited affinity for other receptors, which might
have played a role in their action. EMD-281,014 is the most selective 5-HT2A
antagonist available, with approximately 2,000-fold selectivity over serotonin 2C
(5-HT2C) receptors. EMD-281,014 was previously tested in the clinic and has high 
translational potential. In the present study, we assessed the effect of
EMD-281,014 on dyskinesia and psychosis in the
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-lesioned common marmoset. We 
first determined the pharmacokinetic profile of EMD-281,014 in the marmoset,
after which doses leading to clinically-relevant plasma levels (0.01, 0.03 and
0.1 mg/kg) or vehicle were administered to MPTP-lesioned marmosets, in
combination with L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA). The effects of
EMD-281,014 on dyskinesia, psychosis-like behaviours (PLBs) and parkinsonism were
then evaluated. When added to l-DOPA, EMD-281,014 (0.03 and 0.1 mg/kg) reduced
peak dose dyskinesia, by 41.8% and 54.5% (P < 0.05 and P < 0.001), when compared 
to l-DOPA/vehicle. EMD-281,014 (0.03 and 0.1 mg/kg) also significantly reduced
the severity of peak dose PLBs, by 42.5% and 45.9% (P < 0.05 and P < 0.001), when
compared to vehicle. The anti-dyskinetic and anti-psychotic effects of
EMD-281,014 were achieved without interfering with l-DOPA anti-parkinsonian
action. Our results suggest that highly-selective 5-HT2A receptor blockade with
EMD-281,014 is an effective way to alleviate both dyskinesia and psychosis in PD,
without adversely affecting parkinsonian disability.

The 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-lesioned primate is the
gold-standard animal model of Parkinson disease (PD) and has been used to assess 
the effectiveness of experimental drugs on dyskinesia, parkinsonism, and
psychosis. Three species have been used in most studies-the macaque, marmoset,
and squirrel monkey-the last much less so than the first two species; however,
the predictive value of each species at forecasting clinical efficacy, or lack
thereof, is poorly documented. Here, we have reviewed all the published
literature detailing pharmacologic studies that assessed the effects of
experimental drugs on dyskinesia, parkinsonism, and psychosis in each of these
species and have calculated their predictive value of success and failure at the 
clinical level. We found that, for dyskinesia, the macaque has a positive
predictive value of 87.5% and a false-positive rate of 38.1%, whereas the
marmoset has a positive predictive value of 76.9% and a false-positive rate of
15.6%. For parkinsonism, the macaque has a positive predictive value of 68.2% and
a false-positive rate of 44.4%, whereas the marmoset has a positive predictive
value of 86.9% and a false-positive rate of 41.7%. No drug that alleviates
psychosis in the clinic has shown efficacy at doing so in the macaque, whereas
the marmoset has 100% positive predictive value. The small number of studies
conducted in the squirrel monkey precluded us from calculating its predictive
efficacy. We hope our results will help in the design of pharmacologic
experiments and will facilitate the drug discovery and development process in PD.

Banisteriopsis caapi (B. caapi) contains harmine, harmaline, and
tetrahydroharmine, has monoamine oxidase inhibitory activity, and has reported
antiparkinsonian activity in humans when imbibed as a tea; however, its effects
are poorly documented. For this reason, motor function was assessed in
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-treated common marmosets following
administration of B. caapi extract (28.4-113.6 mg/kg; po), harmine (0.1 and
0.3 mg/kg; sc), and selegiline (10 mg/kg; sc), alone or with a submaximal dose of
L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA; 4-7 mg/kg). L-DOPA reversed motor
disability, increased locomotor activity, and induced moderate dyskinesia.
B. caapi did not increase locomotor activity or induce dyskinesia but at 56.8 and
113.6 mg/kg improved motor disability. The L-DOPA response was unaltered by
co-administration of B. caapi. Harmine (0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg) produced a mild
improvement in motor disability without affecting locomotor activity or
dyskinesia but had no effect on the L-DOPA-induced antiparkinsonian response.
Selegiline (10 mg/kg) alone improved motor function to the same extent as L-DOPA,
but with only mild dyskinesia, and did not alter the response to L-DOPA, although
dyskinesia was reduced. The findings suggest that B. caapi alone has a mild
antiparkinsonian effect but does not enhance the L-DOPA response or reduce
dyskinesia.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder
producing a variety of motor and cognitive deficits with the causes remaining
largely unknown. The gradual loss of the nigrostriatal pathway is currently
considered the pivotal pathological event. To better understand the progression
of PD and improve treatment management, defining the disease on a structural
basis and expanding brain analysis to extra-nigral structures is indispensable.
The anatomical complexity and the presence of neuromelanin, make the use of
non-human primates an essential element in developing putative imaging biomarkers
of PD. To this end, ex vivo T2-weighted magnetic resonance images were acquired
from control and 1-methyl-4 phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated
marmosets. Volume measurements of the caudate, putamen, and substantia nigra
indicated significant atrophy and cortical thinning. Tensor-based morphometry
provided a more extensive and hypothesis free assessment of widespread changes
caused by the toxin insult to the brain, especially highlighting regional
cortical atrophy. The results highlight the importance of developing imaging
biomarkers of PD in non-human primate models considering their distinct
neuroanatomy. It is essential to further develop these biomarkers in vivo to
provide non-invasive tools to detect pre-symptomatic PD and to monitor potential 
disease altering therapeutics.

The common marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus; Cj) is an advantageous nonhuman
primate species for modeling age-related disorders, including Parkinson's
disease, due to their shorter life span compared to macaques. Cj-derived induced 
pluripotent stem cells (Cj-iPSCs) from somatic cells are needed for in vitro
disease modeling and testing regenerative medicine approaches. Here we report the
development of a novel Cj-iPSC line derived from adult marmoset fibroblasts. The 
Cj-iPSCs showed potent pluripotency properties, including the development of
mesodermal lineages in tumors after injection to immunocompromised mice, as well 
as ectoderm and endoderm lineages after in vitro differentiation regimens,
demonstrating differentiated derivatives of all three embryonic layers. In
addition, expression of key pluripotency genes (ZFP42, PODXL, DNMT3B, C-MYC,
LIN28, KLF4, NANOG, SOX2, and OCT4) was observed. We then tested the neural
differentiation capacity and gene expression profiles of Cj-iPSCs and a marmoset 
embryonic stem cell line (Cj-ESC) after dual-SMAD inhibition. Exposure to
CHIR99021 and sonic hedgehog (SHH) for 12 and 16 days, respectively, patterned
the cells toward a ventralized midbrain dopaminergic phenotype, confirmed by
expression of FOXA2, OTX2, EN-1, and tyrosine hydroxylase. These results
demonstrate that common marmoset stem cells will be able to serve as a platform
for investigating regenerative medicine approaches targeting the dopaminergic
system.

Non-human primate (NHP) models of Parkinson disease show many similarities with
the human disease. They are very useful to test novel pharmacotherapies as
reviewed here. The various NHP models of this disease are described with their
characteristics including the macaque, the marmoset, and the squirrel monkey
models. Lesion-induced and genetic models are described. There is no drug to
slow, delay, stop, or cure Parkinson disease; available treatments are
symptomatic. The dopamine precursor, L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-Dopa) still 
remains the gold standard symptomatic treatment of Parkinson. However,
involuntary movements termed L-Dopa-induced dyskinesias appear in most patients
after chronic treatment and may become disabling. Dyskinesias are very difficult 
to manage and there is only amantadine approved providing only a modest benefit. 
In this respect, NHP models have been useful to seek new drug targets, since they
reproduce motor complications observed in parkinsonian patients. Therapies to
treat motor symptoms in NHP models are reviewed with a discussion of their
translational value to humans. Disease-modifying treatments tested in NHP are
reviewed as well as surgical treatments. Many biochemical changes in the brain of
post-mortem Parkinson disease patients with dyskinesias are reviewed and compare 
well with those observed in NHP models. Non-motor symptoms can be categorized
into psychiatric, autonomic, and sensory symptoms. These symptoms are present in 
most parkinsonian patients and are already installed many years before the
pre-motor phase of the disease. The translational usefulness of NHP models of
Parkinson is discussed for non-motor symptoms.

α-Synuclein is a defining, key component of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites in
Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), as well as glial
cytoplasmic inclusions in multiple system atrophy (MSA). The distribution and
spreading of these pathologies are closely correlated with disease progression.
Recent studies have revealed that intracerebral injection of synthetic
α-synuclein fibrils or pathological α-synuclein prepared from DLB or MSA brains
into wild-type or transgenic animal brains induced prion-like propagation of
phosphorylated α-synuclein pathology. The common marmoset is a very small primate
that is expected to be a useful model of human diseases. Here, we show that
intracerebral injection of synthetic α-synuclein fibrils into adult wild-type
marmoset brains (caudate nucleus and/or putamen) resulted in spreading of
abundant α-synuclein pathologies, which were positive for various antibodies to
α-synuclein, including phospho Ser129-specific antibody, anti-ubiquitin and
anti-p62 antibodies, at three months after injection. Remarkably, robust Lewy
body-like inclusions were formed in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neurons in
these marmosets, strongly suggesting the retrograde spreading of abnormal
α-synuclein from striatum to substantia nigra. Moreover, a significant decrease
in the numbers of TH-positive neurons was observed in the injection-side of the
brain, where α-synuclein inclusions were deposited. Furthermore, most of the
α-synuclein inclusions were positive for 1-fluoro-2,5-bis
(3-carboxy-4-hydroxystyryl) benzene (FSB) and thioflavin-S, which are dyes widely
used to visualize the presence of amyloid. Thus, injection of synthetic
α-synuclein fibrils into brains of non-transgenic primates induced PD-like
α-synuclein pathologies within only 3 months after injection. Finally, we provide
evidence indicating that neurons with abnormal α-synuclein inclusions may be
cleared by microglial cells. This is the first marmoset model for α-synuclein
propagation. It should be helpful in studies to elucidate mechanisms of disease
progression and in development and evaluation of disease-modifying drugs for
α-synucleinopathies.

Given the strong coupling between the substantia nigra (SN) and striatum (STR) in
the early stage of Parkinson's disease (PD), yet only a few studies reported to
date that have simultaneously investigated the neurochemistry of these two brain 
regions in vivo, we performed longitudinal metabolic profiling in the SN and STR 
of 1-methyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-intoxicated common marmoset monkey 
models of PD (n = 10) by using proton MRS (1 H-MRS) at 9.4 T. T2 relaxometry was 
also performed in the SN by using MRI. Data were classified into control,
MPTP_2weeks, and MPTP_6-10 weeks groups according to the treatment duration. In
the SN, T2 of the MPTP_6-10 weeks group was lower than that of the control group 
(44.33 ± 1.75 versus 47.21 ± 2.47 ms, p < 0.05). The N-acetylaspartate to total
creatine ratio (NAA/tCr) and γ-aminobutyric acid to tCr ratio (GABA/tCr) of the
MPTP_6-10 weeks group were lower than those of the control group (0.41 ± 0.04
versus 0.54 ± 0.08 (p < 0.01) and 0.19 ± 0.03 versus 0.30 ± 0.09 (p < 0.05),
respectively). The glutathione to tCr ratio (GSH/tCr) was correlated with T2 for 
the MPTP_6-10 weeks group (r = 0.83, p = 0.04). In the STR, however, GABA/tCr of 
the MPTP_6-10 weeks group was higher than that of the control group (0.25 ± 0.10 
versus 0.16 ± 0.05, p < 0.05). These findings may be an in vivo depiction of the 
altered basal ganglion circuit in PD brain resulting from the degeneration of
nigral dopaminergic neurons and disruption of nigrostriatal dopaminergic
projections. Given the important role of non-human primates in translational
studies, our findings provide better understanding of the complicated evolution
of PD.

BACKGROUND: The D1/D2 dopamine agonist apomorphine has poor oral bioavailability,
necessitating subcutaneous administration in the treatment of Parkinson's disease
(PD). Acute subcutaneous injection is used as rescue therapy from "off" periods, 
whereas continuous subcutaneous infusion is used to increase "on" periods and to 
reduce dyskinesia when oral treatment fails. An orally active derivative of
apomorphine would avoid the need for parenteral administration. We now describe
the effects of the orally active compound
R-(-)-11-O-valeryl-N-n-propylnoraporphine (11-OH-NPa valerate) on reversal of
motor disability and expression of dyskinesia in
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated, l-dopa-primed
dyskinetic common marmosets.
METHODS: Locomotor activity, motor disability, and dyskinesia were assessed in
MPTP-treated marmosets following the administration of apomorphine (0.075 mg/kg, 
subcutaneous and 0.28 to 1.12 mg/kg, oral) and 11-OH-NPa valerate (0.19, 0.38,
and 0.75mg/kg, oral).
RESULTS: Subcutaneous administration of apomorphine (0.075 mg/kg) produced a
short-lasting reversal of motor disability and the expression of established
dyskinesia, but when administered orally (0.28-1.12 mg/kg) it had no effect. In
contrast, oral treatment with 11-OH-NPa valerate (0.19 and 0.75 mg/kg) induced a 
dose-related reversal of motor disability and increased locomotor activity with
only mild to moderate dyskinesia. Only at the highest dose (0.75 mg/kg) was
marked dyskinesia seen accompanying an extended period of motor disability
reversal and increased locomotor activity.
CONCLUSION: Oral administration of 11-OH-NPa valerate produced a rapid reversal
of motor disability and, at effective dose levels, had a limited propensity to
induce dyskinesia. 11-OH-NPa valerate is the first orally active derivative of
apomorphine with potential for use in PD. © 2016 International Parkinson and

INTRODUCTION: Insight into susceptibility mechanisms underlying Parkinson's
disease (PD) would aid the understanding of disease etiology, enable target
finding and benefit the development of more refined disease-modifying strategies.
METHODS: We used intermittent low-dose MPTP (0.5 mg/kg/week) injections in
marmosets and measured multiple behavioral and neurochemical parameters.
Genetically diverse monkeys from different breeding families were selected to
investigate inter- and intrafamily differences in susceptibility to MPTP
treatment.
RESULTS: We show that such differences exist in clinical signs, in particular
nonmotor PD-related behaviors, and that they are accompanied by differences in
neurotransmitter levels. In line with the contribution of a genetic component,
different susceptibility phenotypes could be traced back through genealogy to
individuals of the different families.
CONCLUSION: Our findings show that low-dose MPTP treatment in marmosets
represents a clinically relevant PD model, with a window of opportunity to
examine the onset of the disease, allowing the detection of individual
variability in disease susceptibility, which may be of relevance for the
diagnosis and treatment of PD in humans.

Cerebral dopamine neurotrophic factor (CDNF) belongs to a newly discovered family
of evolutionarily conserved neurotrophic factors. We demonstrate for the first
time a therapeutic effect of CDNF in a unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)
lesion model of Parkinson's disease in marmoset monkeys. Furthermore, we tested
the impact of high chronic doses of human recombinant CDNF on unlesioned monkeys 
and analyzed the amino acid sequence of marmoset CDNF. The severity of 6-OHDA
lesions and treatment effects were monitored in vivo using 123I-FP-CIT (DaTSCAN) 
SPECT. Quantitative analysis of 123I-FP-CIT SPECT showed a significant increase
of dopamine transporter binding activity in lesioned animals treated with CDNF.
Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), a well-characterized and
potent neurotrophic factor for dopamine neurons, served as a control in a
parallel comparison with CDNF. By contrast with CDNF, only single animals
responded to the treatment with GDNF, but no statistical difference was observed 
in the GDNF group. However, increased numbers of tyrosine hydroxylase
immunoreactive neurons, observed within the lesioned caudate nucleus of
GDNF-treated animals, indicate a strong bioactive potential of GDNF.

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a small-bodied, popular New World
monkey and is used widely in reproductive biology, neuroscience, and drug
development, due to its comparative ease of handling, high reproductive
efficiency, and its unique behavioral characters. In this review, we discuss the 
marmoset models in Parkinson's disease (PD), which is a neurological movement
disorder primarily resulting from a degeneration of dopaminergic neurons with
clinical features of tremor, rigidity, postural instability, and akinesia. The
most common PD models involve the administration of
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) or 6-hydroxydopamine to study
the pathogenesis and to evaluate novel therapies. Following the systemic or local
administration of these neurotoxins, the marmosets with very severe Parkinson's
symptoms are recommended to be placed in an intensive care unit with artificial
feeding to increase survival rate. All procedures with MPTP should be conducted
in a special room with enclosed cages under negative-pressure by trained
researchers with personal protection. Behavioral tests are conducted to provide
an external measure of the brain pathology. Along with several biomarkers,
including α-synuclein and DJ-1, non-invasive neuroimaging techniques such as
positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are used to evaluate 
the functional changes associated with PD. With the recent growing interest in
potential and novel therapies such as stem cell and gene therapy for PD in Korea,
the marmoset can be considered as a suitable non-human primate model in PD
research to bridge the gap between rodent studies and clinical applications.

The synaptic protein α-synuclein has been identified as a major component of Lewy
bodies, a pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD). Prior to the
formation of Lewy bodies, mislocalization and aggregation of the α-synuclein in
brain tissue is frequently observed in various neurodegenerative diseases.
Aberrant accumulation and localization of α-synuclein are also observed in the
aging human brain, for which reason aging is regarded as a risk factor for
neurodegenerative disease. To investigate changes in α-synuclein properties in
the aging brain, we compared α-synuclein immunoreactivity in brain tissue of
young (2-years-old) and middle-aged (6-years-old) common marmoset (Callithrix
jacchus). Our analyses revealed marked changes in α-synuclein immunoreactivity in
the olfactory bulb of common marmosets of these age cohorts. Perikaryal
α-synuclein aggregations were formed in the olfactory bulb in middle-aged
animals. We also observed signals of α-synuclein accumulation in hippocampus in
this cohort; however, unlike in the olfactory bulb, hippocampal α-synuclein
signals were localized in the synaptic terminals. We did not observe either of
these features in younger marmosets, which suggest that aging may play a role in 
these phenomena. Our results using common marmoset brain corresponded with the
observation that the α-synuclein aggregations were first occurred from olfactory 
bulb in human normal aged and PD brain. Therefore, common marmoset is expected as
useful model for α-synuclein pathology.

Chronic exposure to low-dose 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) 
in marmoset monkeys was used to model the prodromal stage of Parkinson's disease 
(PD), and to investigate mechanisms underlying disease progression and recovery. 
Marmosets were subcutaneously injected with MPTP for a period of 12weeks,
0.5mg/kg once per week, and clinical signs of Parkinsonism, motor- and non-motor 
behaviors were recorded before, during and after exposure. In addition,
postmortem immunohistochemistry and proteomics analysis were performed.
MPTP-induced parkinsonian clinical symptoms increased in severity during
exposure, and recovered after MPTP administration was ended. Postmortem analyses,
after the recovery period, revealed no alteration of the number and sizes of
tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive dopamine (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra.
Also levels of TH in putamen and caudate nucleus were unaltered, no differences
were observed in DA, serotonin or nor-adrenalin levels in the caudate nucleus,
and proteomics analysis revealed no global changes in protein expression in these
brain areas between treatment groups. Our findings indicate that parkinsonian
symptoms can occur without detectable damage at the cellular or molecular level. 
Moreover, we show that parkinsonian symptoms may be reversible when diagnosed and
treated early.

Research aimed at developing new therapies for Parkinson's disease (PD)
critically depend on valid animal models of the disease that allows for repeated 
testing of motor disabilities over extended time periods. We here present an
extensive characterization of a wide range of motor symptoms in the 6-OHDA
marmoset model of PD when tested over several months. The severity of motor
deficits was quantified in two ways: (i) through manual scoring protocols
appropriately adapted to include species specific motor behavior and (ii) using
automated quantitative motion tracking based on image processing of the digital
video recordings. We show that the automated methods allow for rapid and reliable
characterization of motor dysfunctions, thus complementing the manual scoring
procedures, and that robust motor symptoms lasting for several months could be
induced when using a two-stage neurotoxic lesioning procedure involving one
hemisphere at a time. This non-human primate model of PD should therefore be well
suited for long-term evaluation of novel therapies for treatment of PD.

PURPOSE: To investigate the use of diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) to detect
denervation of the nigrostriatal pathway in a nonhuman primate model of Parkinson
disease (PD) after treatment with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine
(MPTP).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was approved by the institutional committee for
animal experiments. DTI was performed in marmosets (n = 6) by using a 7-T
magnetic resonance (MR) imager before and 10 weeks after administration of MPTP. 
Fixed brains of a normal marmoset and a marmoset model of PD (n = 1) were
analyzed by using microscopic tractography. Tyrosine-hydroxylase staining of
dopaminergic neurons and three-dimensional histologic analysis also were
performed in normal marmosets (n = 2) and a PD marmoset model (n = 2) to validate
the course of the nigrostriatal pathway revealed at tractography. Statistical
analysis of voxel-based and post hoc region-of-interest analyses of DTI maps was 
performed by using a paired t test.
RESULTS: At voxel-based analysis of DTI before and after treatment, MPTP-treated 
marmoset brains showed significantly increased axial and radial diffusivity in
the bilateral nigrostriatal pathway (P < .05, false discovery rate corrected).
The largest area of significantly increased diffusivity was an area of axial
diffusivity in the right hemispere (177 mm(3)) that corresponded to the location 
of dopaminergic neurodegeneration at histologic evaluation. Region-of-interest
analysis revealed a 27% increase in axial diffusivity in the right hemisphere
(1.198 mm(2)/sec ± 0.111 to 1.522 mm(2)/sec ± 0.118; P = .002). Three-dimensional
histologic analysis with tyrosine-hydroxylase staining showed the course of the
nigrostriatal pathway and degeneration in the PD marmoset model as the absence of
a tyrosine-hydroxylase stained region. Microscopic tractography showed that the
connection of the substantia nigra to the striatum followed the same course as
the nigrostriatal pathway and fewer fiber tracts in the PD marmoset model.
CONCLUSION: DTI and microscopic tractography showed the loss of fiber structures 
of the nigrostriatal pathway in the marmoset model of PD. The results of this
study provide a potential basis for the use of DTI in the clinical diagnosis of
PD.

l-DOPA is the gold standard for treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). However,
the drug produces some serious side effects, including dyskinesia, which is
characterized by repetitive involuntary movements-including chorea. In the
present preclinical study using a nonhuman primate model, dyskinesia caused by
repeated l-DOPA administration was investigated in the context of behavioral
sensitization by objectively quantifying motor activity in the common marmoset of
PD model (the Parkinsonian marmoset). Twelve male Parkinsonian marmosets
previously treated with MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) and
six intact male marmosets were used. The motor activity of each marmoset was
measured using infrared sensors attached to each individual living cage.
Parkinsonian marmosets (n=6) exhibited behavioral sensitization (enhanced motor
activity) in 10weeks upon oral administration of l-DOPA (10mg/kg per day on
3days/week). These animals also exhibited dyskinesia characterized by repetitive 
rapid movements including chorea in 6-10weeks. Neither behavioral sensitization
nor dyskinesia was observed in Parkinsonian marmosets given vehicle and in intact
marmosets given l-DOPA at the same dose (both n=6 each). Behavioral sensitization
was detected sensitively and objectively on motor activity only in Parkinsonian
marmosets given repeated l-DOPA at a similar dose used in PD patients. The
behavioral feature of the marmosets was dyskinesia similar to that of PD patients
but appeared earlier than would be manifested in humans. In spite of
statistically significant behavioral sensitization, some marmosets did not
exhibit dyskinesia in the present limited l-DOPA administration period. Although 
both commonalities and differences may exist between behavioral sensitization and
dyskinesia, behavioral sensitization is considered to be an objective,
quantitative, sensitive and predictive measure of behavioral mechanism underlying
dyskinesia in preclinical studies in evaluating compounds.

Although deep brain electrical stimulation can alleviate the motor symptoms of
Parkinson disease (PD), just a small fraction of patients with PD can take
advantage of this procedure due to its invasive nature. A significantly less
invasive method--epidural spinal cord stimulation (SCS)--has been suggested as an
alternative approach for symptomatic treatment of PD. However, the mechanisms
underlying motor improvements through SCS are unknown. Here, we show that SCS
reproducibly alleviates motor deficits in a primate model of PD. Simultaneous
neuronal recordings from multiple structures of the cortico-basal
ganglia-thalamic loop in parkinsonian monkeys revealed abnormal highly
synchronized neuronal activity within each of these structures and excessive
functional coupling among them. SCS disrupted this pathological circuit behavior 
in a manner that mimics the effects caused by pharmacological dopamine
replacement therapy or deep brain stimulation. These results suggest that SCS
should be considered as an additional treatment option for patients with PD.

Current dopamine replacement therapies, in Parkinson's disease (PD), result in
aversive side effects and rapid drug dose escalation over time. Therefore, a
non-dopaminergic treatment would be an advantageous supplement to lower the dose 
of dopamine replacement treatment postponing the occurrence of side effects. The 
noradrenergic system plays an important role in the facilitation or maintenance
of the activity of the nigrostriatal dopamine pathways. Here the putative
anti-Parkinson effects of the oral selective alpha2C-adrenoceptor antagonist
(JNJ27063699 0.1-10mg/kg p.o.) and of vehicle (fruit syrup) were evaluated in the
MPTP-marmoset model. Dose-related anti-Parkinson effects were assessed by means
of a behavioural rating scale covering parkinsonian symptoms, body weight and
body temperature, and two test systems assessing locomotor activity and complex
motor skills of hand-eye coordination for controlled movements in MPTP- or
saline-pretreated marmosets. JNJ27063699, at the middle and higher doses,
consistently improved locomotor activity and hand-eye coordination capabilities, 
which indicates an improvement in the coordination of motor control -or
movements- in MPTP-pretreated monkeys. No additional effects on the parkinsonian 
symptoms or side effects were observed on other test systems. Overall, the
findings link deficit in motor coordination with dysfunctional adrenergic
signalling and it suggest that selective alpha2C adrenergic antagonism may
contribute to behavioural improvement in the MPTP-monkey model of PD. In
multi-drug medication JNJ27063699 might have potential in the treatment of motor 
deficit in PD.

Redundant dopaminergic activity may enable compensatory axonal sprouting in
Parkinson disease.

Center, New York, NY; and Department of Neurobiology (Physiology) (H.B.), Hebrew 
University, Jerusalem, Israel.

Neurodegenerative diseases become clinically apparent only after a substantial
population of neurons is lost. This raises the possibility of compensatory
mechanisms in the early phase of these diseases. The importance of understanding 
these mechanisms cannot be underestimated because it may guide future
disease-modifying strategies. Because the anatomy and physiology of the
nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathways have been well described, the study of
Parkinson disease can offer insight into these early compensatory mechanisms.
Collateral axonal sprouting of dopaminergic terminals into the denervated
striatum is the most studied compensatory mechanism in animal (almost exclusively
rodent) models of Parkinson disease and is correlated with behavioral recovery
after partial lesions. This sprouting, however, does not respect the normal
anatomy of the original nigrostriatal pathways and leads to aberrant neuronal
networks. We suggest here that the unique physiologic property of the
dopaminergic innervation of the striatum, namely redundancy of information
encoding, is crucial to the efficacy of compensatory axonal sprouting in the
presence of aberrant anatomical connections. Redundant information encoding
results from the similarity of representation of salient and rewarding events by 
many dopaminergic neurons, from the wide axonal field of a single dopaminergic
neuron in the striatum, and from the nonspecific spatial effect of dopamine on
striatal neurons (volume conductance). Finally, we discuss the relevance of these
findings in animal models to human patients with Parkinson disease.

L-3,4-Dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) is the most effective treatment for
Parkinson's disease (PD), but its long-term administration is complicated by
wearing-off and dyskinesia. UWA-101, a dual, equipotent inhibitor of dopamine
(DAT) and serotonin (SERT) transporters, has previously been shown to
successfully extend duration of anti-parkinsonian benefit of L-DOPA (ON-time),
without exacerbating dyskinesia, in the
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-lesioned marmoset. However,
UWA-101 is racemic and it is unclear whether one or both enantiomers contribute
to its actions, and whether a better therapeutic effect might be attained by
using a single antipode. In the current study, we synthesised the two enantiomers
of UWA-101, R-101 (UWA-121) and S-101 (UWA-122), characterised their
pharmacological profiles and administered them to MPTP-lesioned marmosets.
Parkinsonism, dyskinesia, psychosis-like behaviours and duration of ON-time were 
evaluated. UWA-121 is a dual DAT > SERT inhibitor, with an approximate 10:1
DAT:SERT affinity ratio (inhibitory constants (Ki) of 307 and 3830 nM,
respectively). In combination with L-DOPA, UWA-121 extended duration of ON-time
when compared to L-DOPA/vehicle treatment (by 40%, P < 0.01). UWA-121 also
extended duration of ON-time without dyskinesia (by 215%, P < 0.05) and ON-time
without psychosis-like behaviours when compared to L-DOPA/vehicle treatment (by
345%, P < 0.01). UWA-121 did not worsen the severity of dyskinesia or
psychosis-like behaviours (P > 0.05). UWA-122 is a selective SERT inhibitor (Ki
120 nM, Ki at DAT > 50 μM) and, in combination with L-DOPA, had no effect on
ON-time, dyskinesia or psychosis-like behaviours (P > 0.05). These data indicate 
that dual DAT and SERT inhibitors effectively enhance L-DOPA anti-parkinsonian
action without worsening dyskinesia and that compounds with such a
pharmacological profile represent promising agents against wearing-off in PD.

The anatomy of the caudal zona incerta in rodents and primates.

Watson C(1), Lind CR, Thomas MG.

Author information: 
(1)Curtin University, Perth, Australia; Neuroscience Research Australia, Sydney, 
Australia.

The caudal zona incerta is the target of a recent modification of established
procedures for deep brain stimulation (DBS) for Parkinson's disease and tremor.
The caudal zona incerta contains a number of neuronal populations that are
distinct in terms of their cytoarchitecture, connections, and pattern of
immunomarkers and is located at a position where a number of major tracts
converge before turning toward their final destination in the forebrain. However,
it is not clear which of the anatomical features of the region are related to its
value as a target for DBS. This paper has tried to identify features that
distinguish the caudal zona incerta of rodents (mouse and rat) and primates
(marmoset, rhesus monkey, and human) from the remainder of the zona incerta. We
studied cytoarchitecture, anatomical relationships, the pattern of immunomarkers,
and gene expression in both of these areas. We found that the caudal zona incerta
has a number of histological and gene expression characteristics that distinguish
it from the other subdivisions of the zona incerta. Of particular note are the
sparse population of GABA neurons and the small but distinctive population of
calbindin neurons. We hope that a clearer appreciation of the anatomy of the
region will in the end assist the interpretation of cases in which DBS is used in
human patients.

Macula-less rat and macula-bearing monkey retinas exhibit common lifelong
proteomic changes.

The visual consequences of age-related alterations in the neural retina have been
well documented, but little is known about their molecular bases. We performed a 
comparative proteomic analysis of the retinas in marmosets and rats to identify
proteins for which the expression profiles are altered with maturation and aging.
Protein profiles were compared in the newborn, juvenile, middle-age, and aged
retinas using 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Matrix-assisted desorption
ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry revealed common proteins in rats and 
marmosets that exhibited changes in concentration throughout life. Western blot, 
quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, and
immunohistochemistry analyses of selected proteins and their mRNA were used to
determine whether the changes identified by proteomics were verifiable at the
cellular and molecular levels. We found 4 proteins common to both species
(Parkinson disease [autosomal recessive, early onset] 7/DJ-1, stathmin,
peroxiredoxin, and β-synuclein) whose concentrations were regulated with age.
These findings were confirmed by Western blot, immunohistochemistry, and
quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analyses. The
proteins were localized in certain layers and subsets of cells within the retinas
of both species. The expression of these proteins in the adult human retina was
confirmed with immunohistochemistry. The present study is the first to provide
evidence that the retina is physiologically characterized by specific lifelong
changes in its proteome. These changes are independent of whether the retina
bears a macula, occur in key functional pathways during the processing of visual 
signals, and might be involved in the development of age-related pathologic
entities.

pathological features of parkinsonism in the MPTP marmoset model.

This study evaluates the therapeutic efficacy of the NADPH oxidase inhibitor
apocynin, isolated as principal bioactive component from the medicinal plant
Picrorhiza kurroa, in a marmoset MPTP model of Parkinson's disease (PD). The
methoxy-substituted catechol apocynin has a similar structure as homovanillic
acid (HVA), a metabolite of dopamine (DA). Apocynin acquires its selective
inhibitory capacity of the reactive oxygen species generating NADPH oxidase via
metabolic activation by myeloperoxidase (MPO). As MPO is upregulated in activated
brain microglia cells of PD patients and in MPTP animal models, the conditions
for metabolic activation of apocynin and inhibition of microglia NADPH oxidase
are in place. Marmoset monkeys received oral apocynin (100 mg/kg; p.o.) (n = 5)
or Gum Arabica (controls; n = 5) three times daily until the end of the study,
starting 1 week before PD induction with MPTP (1 mg/kg s.c. for 8 days).
Parkinsonian symptoms, motor function, home-cage activity and body weight were
monitored to assess the disease development and severity. Post-mortem numbers of 
the tyrosine hydroxylase expressing DA neurons in the substantia nigra were
counted. During the MPTP injections, apocynin limited the body weight loss and
relieved parkinsonian symptoms compared to controls (Linear regression, P < 0.05)
indicating a reduction of disease progression. During the last test week,
apocynin also improved the hand-eye coordination performance compared with
vehicle treatment (resp. 39.3 ± 4.5 % and 17.7 ± 6.7 %; P = 0.048) and improved
the home cage activity with 32 % (P = 0.029), indicating anti-Parkinson efficacy.
Apocynin also increased the number of surviving DA neurons in MPTP-treated
marmosets with 8.5 % (P = 0.059), indicating a tendency towards a neuroprotective
efficacy. In conclusion, compensation for the loss of DA and its metabolite HVA
by apocynin mitigates the PD progression and limits the parkinsonian signs and
motor-function deterioration.

BACKGROUND: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) measurement was applied to the
brain of the common marmoset, a small primate species, treated with
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). The marmoset shows prominent
Parkinson's disease (PD) signs due to dopaminergic neural degeneration. Recently,
the transgenic marmoset (TG) carrying human PD genes is developing. For
phenotypic evaluations of TG, non-invasive PET measurement is considered to be
substantially significant. As a reference control for TG, the brain of the
MPTP-marmoset as an established and valid model was scanned by PET. Behavioral
analysis was also performed by recording locomotion of the MPTP-marmoset, as an
objective measure of PD signs.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: MARMOSETS RECEIVED SEVERAL MPTP REGIMENS (SINGLE 
MPTP REGIMEN: 2 mg/kg, s.c., per day for 3 consecutive days) were used for PET
measurement and behavioral observation. To measure immobility as a central PD
sign, locomotion of marmosets in their individual living cages were recorded
daily by infrared sensors. Daily locomotion counts decreased drastically after
MPTP regimens and remained diminished for several months or more. PET scan of the
brain, using [(11)C]PE2I as a ligand of the dopamine (DA) transporter, was
performed once several months after the last MPTP regimen. The mean binding
potential (BP(ND)) in the striatum (putamen and caudate) of the MPTP-marmoset
group was significantly lower than that of the MPTP-free control group (n=5 for
each group). In the MPTP-marmosets, the decrease of BP(ND) in the striatum
closely correlated with the decrease in locomotion counts (r=0.98 in putamen and 
0.91 in caudate).
CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: The present characterization of neural degeneration
using non-invasive PET imaging and of behavioral manifestation in the MPTP
marmoset mimics typical PD characteristics and can be useful in evaluating the
phenotype of TG marmosets being developed.

Long-term polarization of microglia upon α-synuclein overexpression in nonhuman
primates.

Barkholt P(1), Sanchez-Guajardo V, Kirik D, Romero-Ramos M.

We have previously shown that persistent α-synuclein overexpression in ventral
midbrain of marmoset leads to a distinctive neurodegenerative process and motor
defects. The neurodegeneration was confined to caudate putamen dopaminergic
fibers in animals overexpressing wild-type (wt) α-synuclein. However, A53T
α-synuclein overexpression induced neurodegeneration that resulted in nigral
dopaminergic cell death. Here, we analyze the microglia population in the
midbrain of these animals by stereological quantification of Iba1+ cells. Our
data here show that monkeys overexpressing A53T α-synuclein showed a long-term
increase in microglia presenting macrophagic morphology. However, wt α-synuclein 
overexpression, despite the absence of dopaminergic cell death, resulted in a
permanent robust increase of the microglia population characterized by a range of
distinct morphological types that persisted after 1 year. These results confirm
that the microglial response differs depending on the type of α-synuclein
(wt/A53T) and/or whether α-synuclein expression results in cell death or not,
suggesting that microglia may play different roles during disease progression.
Furthermore, the microglial response is modulated by events related to
α-synuclein expression in substantia nigra and persists in the long term. The
data presented here is in agreement with that previously observed in a
recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) α-synuclein rat model, thereby
validating both the findings and the model, and highlighting the translational
potential of the rodent model to higher species closer to humans.

of Parkinson's disease.

L-Dopa-induced dyskinesia in patients with Parkinson's disease can be alleviated 
by amantadine, an antagonist at N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptors. The
antiepileptic drug topiramate, which blocks
α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors, has also been
shown to reduce dyskinesia. The purpose of this study was to examine the
behavioral pharmacology of topiramate alone and in combination with amantadine in
animal models of PD and L-dopa-induced dyskinesia. The effects of topiramate
(5-20 mg/kg) and amantadine (5-20 mg/kg) on abnormal involuntary movements (the
rat homologue of dyskinesia) and Rotarod performance were assessed alone and in
combination in the 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rat following chronic L-dopa
treatment. Dyskinesia, parkinsonian disability, and "on-time" were assessed in
the MPTP-lesioned nonhuman primate following administration of topiramate (5-20
mg/kg) and amantadine (0.1-1.0 mg/kg) alone and in combination. Topiramate and
amantadine dose-dependently reduced dyskinesia in the 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned 
rat, whereas topiramate reduced Rotarod performance; there was no effect on
parkinsonian disability in the MPTP-lesioned nonhuman primate, in which both
drugs reduced dyskinesia. Topiramate and amantadine exhibited differential
antidyskinetic effects on dyskinesia elicited by the dopamine D1 receptor agonist
SKF 38393 (2 mg/kg). Subthreshold doses of both drugs in combination had a
synergistic effect on dyskinesia in the 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rat, with no
worsening of motor performance; this effect was confirmed in the MPTP-lesioned
nonhuman primate, with a selective reduction in "bad on-time." These data confirm
the antidyskinetic potential of topiramate and suggest that combination with
low-dose amantadine may allow better reduction of dyskinesia with no adverse
motor effects.

disease.

STUDY OBJECTIVES: Sleep problems are a common phenomenon in most neurological and
psychiatric diseases. In Parkinson disease (PD), for instance, sleep problems may
be the most common and burdensome non-motor symptoms in addition to the
well-described classical motor symptoms. Since sleep disturbances generally
become apparent in the disease before motor symptoms emerge, they may represent
early diagnostic tools and a means to investigate early mechanisms in PD onset.
The sleep disturbance, REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), precedes PD in
one-third of patients. We therefore investigated sleep changes in marmoset
monkeys treated with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine hydrochloride
(MPTP), the non-human primate model for idiopathic PD.
DESIGN: Mild parkinsonism was induced in 5 marmoset monkeys (3M/2F) over a 2-week
period of subchronic MPTP treatment. Electroencephalograms (EEGs) and
electromyograms (EMGs) were recorded weekly. Motor activity and hand-eye
coordination were also measured weekly, and any signs of parkinsonism were noted 
each day. Sleep parameters, motor activity, and performance data before and after
MPTP treatment were compared between MPTP-treated marmosets and 4 control
marmosets (1M/3F).
RESULTS: MPTP increased the number of sleep epochs with high-amplitude EMG bouts 
during REM sleep relative to control animals (mean ± SEM percentage of REM 58.2 ±
9.3 vs. 29.6 ± 7.7; P < 0.05). Of all sleep parameters measured, RBD-like
measures discriminated best between MPTP-treated and control animals. On the
other hand, functional motor behavior, as measured by hand-eye coordination, was 
not affected by MPTP treatment (correct trials MPTP: 23.40 ± 3.56 vs. control:
36.13 ± 5.88 correct trials; P = 0.32).
CONCLUSIONS: This REM sleep-specific change, in the absence of profound changes
in wake motor behaviors, suggests that the MPTP marmoset model of PD could be
used for further studies into the mechanisms and treatment of RBD and other sleep
disorders in premotor symptom PD.

Overactivity of striatal alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid
(AMPA) glutamate receptors is implicated in the pathophysiology of L-DOPA-induced
dyskinesia (LID) in Parkinson's disease (PD). In this study, we evaluated the
behavioural and molecular effects of acute and chronic blockade of
Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA receptors in animal models of PD and LID. The acute effects
of the Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA receptor antagonist
1-trimethylammonio-5-(1-adamantane-methylammoniopentane) dibromide hydrobromide
(IEM 1460) on abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs) in the 6-hydroxydopamine
(6-OHDA)-lesioned rat and LID in the MPTP-lesioned non-human primate were
assessed. Subsequently, the effects of chronic treatment of 6-OHDA-lesioned rats 
with vehicle, L-DOPA/benserazide (6/15 mg/kg, i.p.) + vehicle or L-DOPA + IEM
1460 (3 mg/kg, i.p.) on behavioural and molecular correlates of priming for LID
were evaluated. In the 6-OHDA-lesioned rat and MPTP-lesioned non-human primate,
acute treatment with IEM 1460 (1-3 mg/kg) dose-dependently reduced LID without
adverse effects on motor performance. Chronic co-treatment for 21 days with IEM
1460 reduced the induction of AIMs by L-DOPA in the 6-OHDA-lesioned rat without
affecting peak rotarod performance, and attenuated AIMs score by 75% following
l-DOPA challenge (p < 0.05). Chronic IEM 1460 treatment reversed L-DOPA-induced
up-regulation of pre-proenkephalin-A, and normalised pre-proenkephalin-B mRNA
expression in the lateral striatum, indicating an inhibition of both behavioural 
and molecular correlates of priming. These data suggest that Ca(2+)-permeable
AMPA receptors are critically involved in both the induction and subsequent
expression of LID, and represent a potential target for anti-dyskinetic
therapies.

From the MPTP-treated primate to the treatment of motor complications in
Parkinson's disease.

Sciences, King's College London, London, UK. peter.jenner@kcl.ac.uk

The MPTP-treated primate has proved to be a highly predictive model of the
effects of dopaminergic drugs in the symptomatic treatment of Parkinson's disease
(PD) and for the avoidance of motor complications. Using MPTP-treated primates,
new dopaminergic therapies have been devised alongside novel treatment strategies
and novel routes of administration while providing knowledge on how to use
dopaminergic drugs in a manner that avoids the onset of motor complications. The 
use of MPTP-treated primates led to the concept of continuous dopaminergic
stimulation (CDS) and the early introduction of dopamine receptor agonists as
monotherapy for PD for the prevention of dyskinesia. However, CDS does not
explain the differences in dyskinesia induction that exist between L-dopa and
dopamine receptor agonists, and a more rationale approach to therapy involves
continuous drug delivery (CDD). CDD has been explored in the MPTP-treated primate
and this review focuses on some of the evidence showing that the delivery of
dopaminergic drugs in PD is key to the avoidance of dyskinesia while maintaining 
therapeutic efficacy. Other types of motor complication, such as "wearing off"
and "on-off" remain to be explored in MPTP-treated primates and the model has yet
to be used to examine non-motor components of PD. Despite having been employed
for almost 25 years, the MPTP-treated primate has many potential uses in the
future that will further improve the treatment of PD.

Two new test methods to quantify motor deficits in a marmoset model for
Parkinson's disease.

The validity of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) as a model for human
disease depends on the development of parameters with clinical relevance. We
tested the effect of treatment with MPTP in two newly developed non-invasive
motor behavioral paradigms in the context of Parkinson's disease. The "Tower" was
designed to quantify the marmoset's natural jumping behavior as a measure for
akinesia, the "Hourglass" to test the marmoset's natural righting reflex as
measure for rigidity, analogous to axial motor behavior in humans. MPTP treatment
affected marmoset behavior in both testing paradigms. The marmoset's righting
reflex in the Hourglass remained significantly impaired during the full 3-week
period after the MPTP intoxication. In the Tower, the marmosets were not able to 
jump the largest distances one week after MPTP and showed a persistent reduction 
in activity during the 3-week period after the MPTP intoxication. Because not all
aspects of motor behavior are similarly affected by MPTP, a complete behavioral
sketch of parkinsonian marmosets should preferably include a range of motor
behavior functions to create an overview of the full range of motor impairments. 
Both the Hourglass and Tower test provide important behavioral parameters in a
clinically relevant multiple testing approach in motor disorder models.

Failed storage capacity, leading to pulsatile delivery of dopamine (DA) in the
striatum, is used to explain the emergence of 'wearing off' and dyskinaesia in
Parkinson's disease. In this study, we show that surviving DA neurons in 6-OHDA
lesioned rats sprout to re-innervate the striatum, and maintain terminal density 
until approximately 60% of neurons are lost. We demonstrate that DA terminal
density correlates with baseline striatal DA concentration ([DA]).
Electrochemical and synaptosome studies in 6-OHDA lesioned rats and primates
suggest that impaired striatal DA re-uptake and increased DA release from medial 
forebrain bundle fibres contribute to maintaining striatal DA levels. In lesioned
rats where terminal density fell by 60% or more, L-DOPA administration increased 
striatal DA levels markedly. The striatal [DA] produced by L-DOPA directly
correlated with the extent of dyskinaesia, suggesting that dyskinaesia was
related to high striatal [DA]. While sprouting and decreased dopamine uptake
transporter function would be expected to contribute to the marked increase in
L-DOPA induced [DA], the increased [DA] was most marked when DAergic fibres were 
>60% denervated, suggesting that other release sites, such as serotonergic fibres
might be contributing. In conclusion, the extent of dyskinaesia was directly
proportional to the extent of DA terminal denervation and levels of
extra-synaptic striatal DA. We propose that sprouting of DA terminals and
decreased dopamine uptake transporter function prevent the appearance of
Parkinsonian symptoms until about 60% loss of nigral neurons, but also contribute
to dysregulated striatal DA release that is responsible for the emergence of
dyskinaesia and 'wearing off'.

Current therapies for Parkinson's disease (PD) like l-dopa and dopamine (DA)
agonists have declined efficacy after long term use. Therefore, research towards 
supplementary or alternative medication is needed. The implementation in PD can
be expedited by application of compounds already used in the clinic. In this
study the therapeutic effects of the psychoactive compounds
Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta(9)-THC) and modafinil were tested in the
1-methyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-marmoset model for PD. The
anti-parkinson effects of Delta(9)-THC (4 mg/kg) and modafinil (100 mg/kg) in
parkinsonian marmosets were assessed with two behavioral rating scales covering
parkinsonian symptoms and involuntary movements and two test systems assessing
the locomotor activity and hand-eye coordination. Delta(9)-THC improved activity 
and hand-eye coordination, but induced compound-related side-effects. Modafinil
improved activity and observed parkinsonian symptoms but not hand-eye
coordination. It can be concluded that both compounds have therapeutic values and
could supplement existing therapies for PD.

Neuroprotective therapeutics stop or slow down the degeneration process in animal
models of Parkinson's disease (PD). Neuronal survival in PD animal models is
often measured by immunohistochemistry. However, dynamic changes in the pathology
of the brain cannot be explored with this technique. Application of proton
magnetic resonance (MR) imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy (MRS) can cover this
lacuna as these techniques are non-invasive and can be repeated over time in the 
same animal. Therefore, the sensitivity of both techniques to measure changes in 
PD-pathology was explored in an experiment studying the neuroprotective effects
of the vigilance enhancer modafinil in a marmoset PD model. Eleven marmoset
monkeys were treated with the neurotoxin 1-methyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine
(MPTP). Six of these 11 animals, simultaneously, received a daily oral dose of
modafinil (100 mg/kg) and five received vehicle for 27 days. MR experiments were 
performed at baseline and 1 and 3.5 weeks after the MPTP intoxication period
after which brains were analyzed with immunohistochemistry. Tyrosine hydroxylase 
immunoreactive (TH-IR) staining of dopamine neurons of the substantia nigra pars 
compacta confirmed that modafinil was able to partially prevent the MPTP-induced 
neuronal damage. In MRS, N-acetylaspartate (NAA)/phosphocreatine (tCR) ratios
confirmed the protective effect indicating that this is a sensitive measure to
detect neuroprotection in the MPTP marmoset model. Furthermore, the number of
TH-IR positive neurons and the NAA/tCR ratio were significantly correlated to
behavioral observations indicating that the changes measured in the brain are
also reflected in the behavior and vice versa.

Gene expression profiling was performed in the laser capture microdissected
substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) after a single administration of
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) in common marmosets. RNA from
substantia nigra pars compacta tissue underwent a double linear amplification and
was then applied to a whole human genome oligo microarray. Since the number of
TH-immunoreactive cells in the SNc decreased to 50% of that in the control after 
14 days and since our previous study showed that down-regulation of mRNA levels
precedes cell death, genes for which mRNA levels were below 50% of levels in the 
vehicle-treated control throughout the experimental period were defined as being 
vulnerable to MPTP in the present study. There were 48 genes that satisfied this 
condition. In order to elucidate mechanisms of dopaminergic cell death in
Parkinson's disease, extensive gene expression studies at various time points
after MPTP and with various MPTP doses are required.

Overexpression of human alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) using recombinant
adeno-associated viral (rAAV) vectors provides a novel tool to study
neurodegenerative processes seen in Parkinson's disease and other
synucleinopathies. We used a pseudotyped rAAV2/5 vector to express human
wild-type (wt) alpha-syn, A53T mutated alpha-syn, or the green fluorescent
protein (GFP) in the primate ventral midbrain. Twenty-four adult common marmosets
(Callithrix jacchus) were followed with regular behavioural tests for 1 year
after transduction. alpha-Syn overexpression affected motor behaviour such that
all animals remained asymptomatic for at least 9 weeks, then motor bias
comprising head position bias and full body rotations were seen in wt-alpha-syn
expressing animals between 15 and 27 weeks; in the later phase, the animals
overexpressing the A53T alpha -syn, in particular, showed a gradual worsening of 
motor performance, with increased motor coordination errors. Histological
analysis from animals overexpressing either the wt or A53T alpha -syn showed
prominent degeneration of dopaminergic fibres in the striatum. In the ventral
midbrain, however, the dopaminergic neurodegeneration was more prominent in the
A53T group than in the WT group suggesting differential toxicity of these two
proteins in the primate brain. The surviving cell bodies and their processes in
the substantia nigra were stained by antibodies to the pathological form of
alpha-syn that is phosphorylated at Ser position 129. Moreover, we found, for the
first time, ubiquitin containing aggregates after overexpression of alpha-syn in 
the primate midbrain. There was also a variable loss of oligodendroglial cells in
the cerebral peduncle. These histological and behavioural data suggest that this 
model provides unique opportunities to study progressive neurodegeneration in the
dopaminergic system and deposition of alpha-syn and ubiquitin similar to that
seen in Parkinson's disease, and to test novel therapeutic targets for
neuroprotective strategies.

Parkinson's disease.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterised by the loss of dopaminergic neurones in
the substantia nigra (SN) but the pathogenic mechanism remains unknown. Cell
death involves oxidative stress and inflammatory mechanisms, and these may be
altered by the actions of the glycosylated phosphoprotein osteopontin (OPN). OPN 
is present in the rat SN, but its presence in human and non-human primate brain
has not been extensively studied. Both OPN mRNA and protein were present in the
normal marmoset SN, and OPN protein was localised to nigral neurones although
these were not dopaminergic cells and it was not present in glial cells. In
contrast, OPN protein was found in dopaminergic neurones in the normal human SN
but again not in glial cells with some accumulation in the extracellular matrix. 
Following MPTP treatment of common marmosets, OPN protein expression was
decreased, although its mRNA levels were unchanged and it was not present in
either activated microglia or astrocytes. In the SN in PD, OPN protein expression
was decreased in the remaining dopaminergic neurones and it was present in
activated microglia but not in astrocytes. This was not specific to PD as OPN
protein expression was also decreased in the SN in multiple system atrophy and
progressive supranuclear palsy with an identical localisation of the protein. The
presence of OPN in the normal human and non-human primate SN coupled to its
decreased expression following nigral cell degeneration suggests that it may play
an important role in dopaminergic neurone survival.

The vigilance-enhancing agent modafinil has neuroprotective properties: it
prevents striatal ischemic injury, nigrostriatal pathway deterioration after
partial transsection and intoxication with 1-methyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine.
The present study determines the protective effects of modafinil in the marmoset 
1-methyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine Parkinson model on behavior and on monoamine 
levels. Twelve marmoset monkeys were treated with a total dose of 6 mg/kg
1-methyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine. Simultaneously, six animals received a daily
oral dose of modafinil (100 mg/kg) and six animals received vehicle for 27 days. 
Behavior was observed daily and the locomotor activity, hand-eye coordination,
small fast movements, anxiety-related behavior and startle response of the
animals were tested twice a week for 3 weeks. Modafinil largely prevented the
1-methyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-induced change in observed behavior,
locomotor activity, hand-eye coordination and small fast movements, whereas the
vehicle could not prevent the devastating effects of
1-methyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine. Dopamine levels in the striatum of the
vehicle+1-methyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-treated animals were reduced to 5% of
control levels, whereas the dopamine levels of the
modafinil+1-methyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-treated animals were reduced to 41%
of control levels. The present data suggest that modafinil prevents decrease of
movement-related behavior and dopamine levels after
1-methyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine intoxication and can be an efficaceous
pharmacological intervention in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.

BACKGROUND: The control of motor complications following dopaminergic medication 
in late-stage Parkinson disease remains problematic.
OBJECTIVE: We now investigate the potential of oral administration of the
long-acting dopamine D2/D3 agonist piribedil to decrease the expression of
dyskinesia induced by prior exposure to levodopa in
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine hydrochloride (MPTP)-treated
primates.
METHODS: MPTP-treated common marmosets were treated with equieffective doses of
levodopa (10.0-12.5 mg/kg PO, twice daily) or piribedil (3.0-4.0 mg/kg PO, once
daily) for 30 days and then switched to the alternative treatment for a further
35 days.
RESULTS: Levodopa administration markedly improved motor function, but dyskinesia
rapidly appeared and intensified as treatment progressed. Administration of
piribedil produced a similar reversal of MPTP-induced motor deficits but with
comparatively mild dyskinesia. On switching from levodopa to piribedil, the
intensity of dyskinesia decreased without altering the improvement in motor
deficits. However, on switching from piribedil to levodopa, the rapid increase in
dyskinesia despite the improvement in motor function being maintained suggests
that piribedil also primes for but does not markedly express dyskinesia.
CONCLUSION: The study confirms the low dyskinesia expression resulting from
piribedil treatment compared with an equieffective dose of levodopa. Importantly,
the results show that switching from levodopa to piribedil rapidly results in a
sustained decrease in dyskinesia intensity.

Histamine H3 receptor agonists reduce L-dopa-induced chorea, but not dystonia, in
the MPTP-lesioned nonhuman primate model of Parkinson's disease.

Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

L-dopa-induced dyskinesia (LID) remains a major complication of the treatment of 
Parkinson's disease. The neural mechanisms underlying LID are thought to involve 
overactivity of striatal glutamatergic neurotransmission, with resultant
underactivation of the output regions of the basal ganglia. Histamine H3
heteroreceptors can reduce glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)
transmission in the striatum and substantia nigra reticulata, respectively. Thus,
we tested whether the histamine H3 receptor agonists immepip and imetit can
alleviate LID in the MPTP-lesioned marmoset model of Parkinson's disease.
Coadministration of immepip (1 mg/kg) with L-dopa (15 mg/kg) was associated with 
significantly less total dyskinesia than L-dopa alone. When dyskinesia was
separately rated as chorea and dystonia, coadministration of L-dopa with either
immepip or imetit (both 10 mg/kg) significantly reduced chorea but had no effect 
on dystonia. The antidyskinetic actions of the H3 agonists were not accompanied
by alteration of the antiparkinsonian actions of L-dopa. However, immepip (10
mg/kg), when administered as monotherapy, significantly increased parkinsonian
disability compared to vehicle. Overall, the results obtained in this study
suggest that histamine H3 receptors may be involved in the neural mechanisms
underlying L-dopa-induced dyskinesia in Parkinson's disease.

Marmoset monkey models of Parkinson's disease: which model, when and why?

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disease, with
clinical features of tremor, muscular rigidity and akinesia, occurring as a
result of midbrain dopamine loss. The search for treatments has relied heavily on
animal models of the disorder. The use of monkey models of PD plays a distinct
role in the development and assessment of novel treatments. The common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus) is a popular New World monkey used in the search for new
treatments. These monkeys are easy to handle and survive well in captivity. This 
review examines the advantages of using marmoset monkeys in PD research and
examines the different models available with reference to their use in
pre-clinical assessment for novel therapeutic treatments. The most common models 
involve the administration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)
or 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). Recently, selective cerebral transgenic
over-expression of alpha-synuclein has also been attempted in marmosets as a
potential model for PD. Each model has its advantages. The MPTP-based model in
marmosets resembles the disease with regards to the neuroanatomy of
neurotransmitter loss; the unilateral application of 6-OHDA allows for the
assessment of more complex sensorimotor deficits due to the presence of an intact
'control' side; the over-expression of alpha-synuclein in the midbrain results in
the slow onset of behavioural symptoms allowing for a pre-symptomatic time
window. The appropriateness of each of these marmoset models for the assessment
of treatments depends on several factors including the experimental aim of the
study and whether emphasis is placed on the analysis of behavioural deficits.

Proteasomal activity in brain differs between species and brain regions and
changes with age.

Author information:

King's College, London, UK.

Age-related increase in protein oxidation in brain coupled to an impairment of
proteasomal activity may underline neuronal loss but differences in
susceptibility between species and brain regions remain unexplained. We now
investigate differences in proteasomal activity, measured as chymotrypsin-,
trypsin- and peptidylglutamyl-like hydrolysing activities between brain regions
in rats, mice and common marmosets. In aged rats and mice, proteasomal activity
was decreased in the cortex, striatum, cerebellum, globus pallidus and substantia
nigra overall when compared to young animals. However, in the aged brain only
chymotrypsin-like activity was decreased in the cortex and the globus pallidus
while only trypsin-like activity was reduced in the cerebellum. In contrast, in
the striatum, both chymotrypsin-like and trypsin-like activities were reduced and
in the substantia nigra, all the three catalytic activities of proteasome were
significantly impaired. Chymotrypsin-like and trypsin-like activities were
significantly higher in all the brain regions of marmosets compared to those of
mice and rats. Peptidylglutamyl-like activity was only significantly higher in
the cerebellum and striatum of marmoset compared to rodents. The data suggest
that there is higher proteasome activity in common marmoset brain compared to rat
and mouse and that the basal ganglia are more prone to an age-related decrease in
proteasomal activity. This may explain the involvement of altered
ubiquitin-proteasome system activity in Parkinson's disease and the relationship 
to ageing.

Current neurosurgical strategies target overactive brain regions including the
subthalamic nucleus, globus pallidus and thalamus to control various symptoms of 
Parkinson's disease. Subthalamotomy improves akinesia and can induce postural
deficits in both parkinsonian humans and animals, pallidotomy improves limb
dyskinesia and more variably, distal bradykinesia whilst thalamotomy improves
tremor. Because the SNr also becomes overactive in PD and there are few surgical 
studies in parkinsonian primates, we therefore evaluated the effects of lesioning
the SNr in hemiparkinsonian marmosets to establish the effects on symptomatology.
Nine monkeys received unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesions. Seven weeks 
later, four received kainic acid lesions of the SNr. Behavioural tests were
performed prior to 6-OHDA surgery and then fortnightly for 14 weeks. Unilateral
6-OHDA lesions induced ipsilateral postural bias, ipsilateral rotation after
amphetamine injection and bradykinesia. Whilst, SNr lesions significantly altered
the direction of head position and amphetamine-induced rotation relative to
6-OHDA lesions, there was no improvement in 6-OHDA-induced reaching deficits or
sensorimotor neglect. Unbiased quantitation of the nigral lesions showed on
average 88% loss of dopaminergic neurons after 6-OHDA lesions and 77% loss of
non-dopaminergic neurons after SNr lesions. Our results demonstrate that the SNr 
is important in body orientation changes in parkinsonism.

Continuous low-level glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor delivery using

The therapeutic potential of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF)
for Parkinson's disease is likely to depend on sustained delivery of the
appropriate amount to the target areas. Recombinant adeno-associated viral
vectors (rAAVs) expressing GDNF may be a suitable delivery system for this
purpose. The aim of this study was to define a sustained level of GDNF that does 
not affect the function of the normal dopamine (DA) neurons but does provide
anatomical and behavioral protection against an intrastriatal 6-hydroxydopamine
(6-OHDA) lesion in the common marmoset. We found that unilateral intrastriatal
injection of rAAV resulting in the expression of high levels of GDNF (14 ng/mg of
tissue) in the striatum induced a substantial bilateral increase in tyrosine
hydroxylase protein levels and activity as well as in DA turnover. Expression of 
low levels of GDNF (0.04 ng/mg of tissue), on the other hand, produced only
minimal effects on DA synthesis and only on the injected side. In addition, the
low level of GDNF provided approximately 85% protection of the nigral DA neurons 
and their projections to the striatum in the 6-OHDA-lesioned hemisphere.
Furthermore, the anatomical protection was accompanied by a complete attenuation 
of sensorimotor neglect, head position bias, and amphetamine-induced rotation. We
conclude that when delivered continuously, a low level of GDNF in the striatum
(approximately threefold above baseline) is sufficient to provide optimal
functional outcome.

Overactive AMPA receptor-mediated transmission may be involved in the
pathogenesis of levodopa-induced dyskinesia. The mechanism of action of the
anticonvulsant drug topiramate involves attenuation of AMPA receptor-mediated
transmission. In this study, the potential antidyskinetic action of topiramate
was examined in the MPTP-lesioned marmoset model of Parkinson's disease and
levodopa-induced dyskinesia. Topiramate significantly reduced levodopa-induced
dyskinesia, without affecting the antiparkinsonian action of levodopa. Topiramate
represents an exciting potential novel therapeutic approach to levodopa-induced
dyskinesia in patients with Parkinson's disease.

OBJECTIVE: Although olfactory disturbance appears to occur in the early stages of
Parkinson's disease (PD) in humans, little is known about its mechanism. The aim 
of this study was to make a PD model using injection of
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) in the common marmoset and to
discover the mechanism of olfactory disturbance in this animal.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Olfactory disturbance induced by MPTP in the common
marmoset was observed by behavioral, biochemical and immunohistochemical means.
RESULTS: Administration of MPTP caused common marmosets to enter an akinetic
state within a few days and to show signs of impaired olfactory function.
Biochemical study showed a decrease in dopamine levels, especially in tissue
samples from the caudate nucleus and putamen. Immunohistochemical analysis
revealed a lack of tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity, not only in the
substantia nigra, caudate nucleus and putamen but also in the olfactory tubercle.
CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that MPTP causes both PD-like symptoms and 
olfactory disturbance in the common marmoset. The olfactory disturbance observed 
in these animals may be due to the lack of dopamine in the olfactory tubercle.

Dissociation of hemi-spatial and hemi-motor impairments in a unilateral primate
model of Parkinson's disease.

Monkeys with unilateral lesions of nigrostriatal dopamine projections were tested
on a series of spatial tasks. One task, in which monkeys were required to use one
or the other arm to retrieve food rewards from different positions, allowed
separate assessment of the use of each arm in each hemi-space in order to
distinguish hemi-spatial and hemi-motor impairments. The lesioned monkeys
exhibited a persistent neglect of contralesional space when using either arm
which could be dissociated from a motor impairment in the contralesional arm
alone. Another task allowed free use of either arm across peri-personal space and
demonstrated an ipsilesional bias in the monkeys' self-determined attention
(orientation) to a task which they were trying to perform. It is argued that the 
tendency for monkeys with this lesion to rotate ipsilesionally is due to an
ipsilesional deviation of the 'centre of interest' (determined by telencephalic
circuitry) relative to 'straight ahead' (determined by brainstem circuitry). The 
dopamine projections may contribute to cortico-subcortical circuits which
determine the spatial layout of mental representation, attention and intention.
The results in this primate model of unilateral Parkinson's disease (PD) support 
the view that patients with left-sided Parkinsonian symptoms exhibit a unilateral
deficit in spatial mental representation as well as their well-recognised motor
symptoms. Patients with bilateral Parkinson's symptoms may exhibit bilateral
deficits in mental representation.

1. The loss of central dopamine, which characterises Parkinson's disease, led to 
the main pharmacological strategy for treatment, namely levodopa, a
dopamine-replacement therapy. Several years after treatment, the majority of
patients experience dose-limiting side-effects and loss of symptom control. There
is a resurgence of interest in neurosurgery for treating the Parkinson's disease,
particularly in new techniques targeting the subthalamic nucleus (STN), which is 
overactive in Parkinson's disease and contributes to symptom development. 2. We
performed unilateral subthalamotomy (lesioning the subthalamic nucleus via the
toxin N-methyl-d-aspartate) in marmosets and rats with experimentally induced
parkinsonism (induced using the toxin 6-hydroxydopamine). A range of similar
behaviours common to both rodents and primates were evaluated before and after
each type of surgery. Post-mortem histology was used to confirm the lesions. We
also provide details of a case with Parkinson's disease who underwent
high-frequency bilateral stimulation of the STN and in whom we analysed the STN
post-mortem. 3. Unilateral subthalamotomy improved akinesia in parkinsonian
primates. However, both monkeys and rodents showed postural abnormalities. The
patient who underwent bilateral high-frequency stimulation showed improvement of 
akinesia and other disease symptoms and no postural abnormalities. Post-mortem
analysis did not demonstrate substantial damage of the STN as a result of the
electrodes. 4. Although unilateral subthalamotomy improves some aspects of
parkinsonism, it causes postural abnormalities in animal models of Parkinson's
disease. Because bilateral high-frequency STN stimulation improves disease
symptoms, is reversible and is not reported to induce postural side-effects, it
may be a better surgical therapy for Parkinson's disease than lesioning the STN.

Alterations in m-RNA expression for Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase and glutathione
peroxidase in the basal ganglia of MPTP-treated marmosets and patients with
Parkinson's disease.

Alterations occurring in the antioxidant enzymes, copper, zinc-dependent
superoxide dismutase (Cu,Zn-SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) following
nigral dopaminergic denervation are unclear. We now report on the distribution
and levels of m-RNA for Cu,Zn-SOD and GPX in basal ganglia of normal and
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated common marmosets, and
in normal individuals and patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) using in situ
hybridization histochemistry and oligodeoxynucleotide (single-stranded DNA)
probes. Cu,Zn-SOD and GPX m-RNA was present throughout basal ganglia (nucleus
accumbens, caudate-putamen, globus pallidus, substantia nigra) in the common
marmoset, with the highest levels being in substantia nigra (SN). Following MPTP 
induced nigral cell loss, Cu,Zn-SOD m-RNA levels were decreased in all areas but 
the SNr, and particularly in SNc (71%, P<0.001). MPTP-treatment had no effect on 
GPX m-RNA expression in any area of basal ganglia. Cu,Zn-SOD and GPX m-RNA was
also present in the normal human SN. In PD, however, Cu,Zn-SOD m-RNA was
significantly decreased (89%, P<0.005) in SNc, and there was a near-complete loss
of GPX m-RNA in both SNc (100%, P<0.005) and SNr (88%, P<0.005). The loss of
Cu,Zn-SOD m-RNA in SNc in MPTP-treated marmosets and patients with PD suggests
that it is primarily located in dopaminergic neuronal cell bodies. The loss of
GPX m-RNA in SNc in PD also suggests a localisation to dopaminergic cell bodies, 
but the similar change in SNr may indicate its presence in dopaminergic neurites.
In contrast, the absence of change in GPX m-RNA in MPTP-treated primates appears 
to rule out its presence in dopaminergic cells in this species, but this may only
be apparent and may reflect increased expression in glial cells following acute
toxin treatment.

Nonhuman primates (NHPs) have provided robust experimental animal models for many
human-related diseases due to their similar physiologies. Nonetheless, profound
differences remain in the acquisition, progression, and outcome of important
diseases such as AIDS and Alzheimer's, for which the underlying basis remains
obscure. We explored the utility of human high-density oligonucleotide arrays to 
survey the transcription profile of NHP genomes. Total RNA from prefrontal
cortices of human (Homo sapiens), common chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes),
cynomolgous macaque (Macaca fascicularis), and common marmoset (Callithrix
jacchus) was labeled and hybridized to Affymetrix U95A GeneChip probe arrays.
Corresponding data obtained previously from common chimpanzee and orangutan
(Pongo pygmaeus) were added for comparison. Qualitative (present or not detected)
and quantitative (expression level) analysis indicated that many genes known to
be involved in human neurological disorders were present and regulated in NHPs. A
gene involved in dopamine metabolism (catechol-O-methyltransferase) was absent in
macaque and marmoset. Glutamate receptor 2 was up-regulated, and
transcription-associated genes were down-regulated in NHPs compared with humans. 
We demonstrate that transcript profiling of NHPs could provide comparative
genomic data to validate and better focus experimental animal models of human
neurological disorders.

We used a high-titer recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vector to express 
WT or mutant human alpha-synuclein in the substantia nigra of adult marmosets.
The alpha-synuclein protein was expressed in 90-95% of all nigral dopamine
neurons and distributed by anterograde transport throughout their axonal and
dendritic projections. The transduced neurons developed severe neuronal
pathology, including alpha-synuclein-positive cytoplasmic inclusions and granular
deposits; swollen, dystrophic, and fragmented neuritis; and shrunken and
pyknotic, densely alpha-synuclein-positive perikarya. By 16 wk posttransduction, 
30-60% of the tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons were lost, and the tyrosine
hydroxylase-positive innervation of the caudate nucleus and putamen was reduced
to a similar extent. The rAAV-alpha-synuclein-treated monkeys developed a type of
motor impairment, i.e., head position bias, compatible with this magnitude of
nigrostriatal damage. rAAV vector-mediated alpha-synuclein gene transfer provides
a transgenic primate model of nigrostriatal alpha-synucleinopathy that is of
particular interest because it develops slowly over time, like human Parkinson's 
disease (PD), and expresses neuropathological features (alpha-synuclein-positive 
inclusions and dystrophic neurites, in particular) that are similar to those seen
in idiopathic PD. This model offers new opportunities for the study of
pathogenetic mechanisms and exploration of new therapeutic targets of particular 
relevance to human PD.

Motor effects of a dopamine stabilizer (GMC1111) in primate models of Parkinson
and hemiparkinsonism.

The effects on motor behavior of a new potential dopamine stabilizer:
2-amino-6-(N,N-di-n-propylamino)thiazolo[4,5-f]indan (GMC1111) were investigated 
in common marmosets with 6-hydroxydopamine lesions within the median forebrain
bundle (12 unilateral, 6 bilateral). GMC1111 was administered orally or
subcutaneously (s.c.) to unilaterally 6-hydroxydopamine lesioned monkeys, either 
alone or together with s.c. injections of apomorphine (0.2 mg/kg) and the effect 
on rotational behavior was examined. GMC1111 (0.03-3.0 mg/kg) alone, orally or
s.c., did not induce rotational behavior. When apomorphine and GMC1111 were
injected simultaneously, rotations were nearly abolished in three monkeys with a 
baseline apomorphine-induced rotation rate below 13/min, whereas GMC1111 did not 
modify the rotations in three high-rotating animals (>17/min). Oral
administration of GMC1111 (1.0 and 3.0 mg/kg) abolished the apomorphine-induced
rotations in another six unilaterally dopamine-denervated monkeys, indicating a
good oral bioavailability. A low dose of GMC1111 (0.3 mg/kg) administered s.c. to
marmosets with bilateral nigrostriatal lesions produced a reduction of Parkinson 
symptoms of approximately the same degree as with levodopa/benserazide (15/3.75
mg/kg), while higher doses of GMC1111 were less effective. When
levodopa/benserazide was administered together with various doses of GMC1111
(0.3-3.0 mg/kg), the levodopa-induced peak-dose dyskinesias were reduced with the
highest dose of GMC1111 (3 mg/kg). Taken together, GMC1111 modifies dopaminergic 
activity in a normalizing direction. Parkinson symptoms, as well as
levodopa-induced dyskinesias are both reduced. This suggests the arrival of
another member of the new dopamine stabilizer family.

Naloxone reduces levodopa-induced dyskinesias and apomorphine-induced rotations
in primate models of parkinsonism.

Klintenberg R(1), Svenningsson P, Gunne L, Andrén PE.

Using in situ hybridization, it was found that subchronic treatment with
levodopa/benserazide increased preproenkephalin-A and preproenkephalin-B mRNAs in
the dopamine-depleted striatum. In order to examine whether dysfunction of the
endogenous opioid system may underlie the development of levodopa-induced
dyskinesias, the effect of naloxone, an opioid antagonist, on dyskinesias was
investigated in two models of parkinsonism in the common marmoset. MPTP-treated
monkeys were administered a daily oral dose of levodopa/benserazide which
relieved the parkinsonian symptoms but induced severe and reproducible dyskinetic
movements. Naloxone (0.1, 0.2 or 0.5 mg/kg) was given subcutaneously (s.c.)
during peak-dose dyskinesia, which reduced the dyskinesias significantly using
the highest dose, normalized the motor activity, but did not modify the
antiparkinson effect. Unilaterally 6-OHDA -lesioned marmosets received
apomorphine s.c., which caused a contralateral turning behavior that could be
reduced up to 35 percent by concomitant administration of naloxone. Taken
together the present results suggest a possible role for the endogenous opioid
system in the pathogenesis of levodopa-induced dyskinesia in primates.

The monoamine reuptake blocker brasofensine reverses akinesia without dyskinesia 
in MPTP-treated and levodopa-primed common marmosets.

The common marmoset develops motor deficits after MPTP treatment and exhibits
dyskinesia after chronic levodopa (L-dopa) dosing and subsequent re-challenge
with L-dopa and other dopaminergic agents. We report on the actions of the potent
monoamine reuptake blocker brasofensine on motor disability, locomotor activity, 
and dyskinesia in the 1-methyl-4-1, 2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) -treated
marmoset model of Parkinson's disease. Oral administration of brasofensine (0.25,
0.5, 1.0, or 2.5 mg/kg) to MPTP-treated marmosets produced a long-lasting,
dose-dependent increase in locomotor activity and reduction in disability scores.
In addition, coadministration of the lowest dose of brasofensine (0.25 mg/kg
orally) with a threshold oral dose of L-dopa (2.5 mg/kg) caused a marked increase
in locomotor activity, greater than that produced by either drug alone. In other 
MPTP-treated marmosets previously primed to exhibit dyskinesia by repeated L-dopa
dosing, brasofensine effectively reversed akinesia with a naturalistic and
prolonged motor response without the appearance of dyskinesia or stereotypy. This
finding contrasts with the severe dyskinesia, stereotypy, and hyperkinesis
produced by equivalent doses of L-dopa. The ability of brasofensine to produce a 
prolonged and naturalistic antiparkinsonian response without eliciting dyskinesia
after previous L-dopa priming may relate to actions on D(1) receptor-linked
pathways. These findings suggest that monoamine reuptake blockade may be of value
in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, both early in the disease course and
when L-dopa-induced dyskinesias complicate treatment.

Neuroprotective effect of riluzole in a primate model of Parkinson's disease:
behavioral and histological evidence.

Our study aimed to determine whether riluzole, which has shown efficacy as a
disease-modifying agent in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), is
neuroprotective in a marmoset model of Parkinson's disease (PD). Reduction of
energy demand by riluzole could be a rational neuroprotective strategy with good 
tolerability. The efficacy of riluzole was evaluated in marmosets by testing its 
ability to reduce MPTP-induced behavioral deficits and loss of dopaminergic
nigral neurons. Marmosets were divided into two groups of four animals each:
animals in Group 1 were injected twice with MPTP (2 mg/kg subcutaneous) and
treated with riluzole (10 mg/kg per os b.i.d.), animals in Group 2 (controls)
were injected with MPTP and with the vehicle of riluzole. A third group of
marmosets which did not receive MPTP or riluzole drug was introduced for
neurohistopathological studies (normal animals). Marmosets treated with riluzole 
preserved a better motor function and neurological performance through the 26
days of assessment when compared with the controls. Histologically, there was
sparing of TH- and Nissl-stained nigral neurons and of TH-stained terminals in
the striatum and the putamen in the group treated with riluzole compared to the
controls. We conclude that riluzole protects dopaminergic neurons and reduces
behavioral deficits in a marmoset model of PD.

Coadministration of (-)-OSU6162 with l-DOPA normalizes preproenkephalin mRNA
expression in the sensorimotor striatum of primates with unilateral 6-OHDA
lesions.

Sweden.

The substituted phenylpiperidine (-)-OSU6162 is a novel modulator of the
dopaminergic systems with low affinity for dopamine D(2) receptors and potent
normalizing effects on l-DOPA-induced dyskinesias. We studied the effects of
coadministration of (-)-OSU6162 with l-DOPA on the regulation of striatal
preproenkephalin (PPE) and prodynorphin (PDyn) mRNA expression in the primate
brain by in situ hybridization histochemistry. Common marmoset monkeys sustaining
unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesions of the nigrostriatal pathway received
l-DOPA/carbidopa, l-DOPA/carbidopa plus (-)-OSU6162, or vehicle over 14 days. In 
vehicle-treated animals, PPE mRNA levels were markedly increased in the
sensorimotor territory of the lesioned striatum. By contrast, a rather uniform
lesion-induced reduction of PDyn mRNA levels was found in the vehicle group.
Subchronic l-DOPA treatment induced a further increase in PPE mRNA expression in 
a number of sensorimotor and associative subregions of the denervated striatum.
Coadministration of (-)-OSU6162 with l-DOPA partially reversed the lesion- and
l-DOPA-induced elevation of PPE expression and, by affecting PPE mRNA expression 
differentially on the intact and lesioned striatum, markedly reduced the
side-to-side difference in PPE mRNA expression. The effects on PPE mRNA
expression were apparent throughout the rostrocaudal extent of the putamen and
the dorsal portions of the caudate nucleus. l-DOPA treatment resulted in an
enhancement in PDyn mRNA expression in all functional compartments of the
striatum. Coadministration of (-)-OSU6162 had no apparent influence on these
l-DOPA-induced changes in PDyn mRNA expression. The present results suggest that 
(-)-OSU6162 acts primarily by modifying striatal output via the indirect pathway.

Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor concentration dependently improves
disability and motor activity in MPTP-treated common marmosets.

(1)Neurodegenerative Disease Research Centre, Hodgkin Building, GKT School of
Biomedical Sciences, King's College London, Guy's Campus, SE1 1UL, London, UK.

Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) has previously reduced motor
deficits and preserved nigral dopamine neurones in rhesus monkeys with a
unilateral MPTP-induced lesion of substantia nigra. We now report on the ability 
of GDNF to reverse motor deficits induced by parenteral administration of
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) to common marmosets resulting
in bilateral degeneration of the nigrostriatal pathway. Prior to GDNF
administration, all MPTP-treated animals showed akinesia or bradykinesia,
rigidity, postural instability and tremor. Intraventricular injection of GDNF
(10, 100 or 500 microg) at 9 and 13 weeks post MPTP treatment resulted in a
concentration dependent improvement in locomotor activity and motor disability
which became significant after administration of 100 and 500 microg of GDNF. The 
most prominent improvements were in alertness, checking movements, and posture.
It is concluded that intraventricular GDNF administration improves bilateral
Parkinsonian motor disability following MPTP treatment and this may reflect an
action of GDNF on remaining nigral dopaminergic neurones.

L-DOPA produces strong induction of c-fos messenger RNA in dopamine-denervated
cortical and striatal areas of the common marmoset.

Common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) with near-complete unilateral
6-hydroxydopamine denervation of the dopaminergic input received a single
injection of saline or L-DOPA (15mg/kg plus 6.25mg/kg benserazide). Using in situ
hybridization, the effects of these treatments on c-fos messenger RNA expression 
in the cerebral cortex, the striatal complex and the external layer of the
pallidum were studied. Moreover, receptor autoradiography was used to determine
the levels of dopamine D(1) and D(2) receptors in these areas. In the cerebral
cortex, animals treated with L-DOPA displayed a high expression of c-fos
messenger RNA restricted to the dopamine-denervated hemisphere. No changes in the
levels of cortical D(1) and D(2) receptors were found in the dopamine-denervated 
hemisphere. L-DOPA treatment also induced a strong expression of c-fos messenger 
RNA in the striatal complex in the dopamine-denervated hemisphere. The levels of 
striatal D(2), but not D(1), receptors were increased in the dopamine-denervated 
hemisphere. In the external pallidum, the major terminal region for D(2) dopamine
receptor-containing striatal projection neurons, L-DOPA treatment induced c-fos
messenger RNA expression in both the intact and the dopamine-denervated
hemispheres.Thus, using c-fos messenger RNA as a biochemical marker of
postsynaptic neuronal activation, these results provide evidence that
near-complete dopamine depletion causes a profound supersensitization to L-DOPA
treatment in the cerebral cortex and in the striatal complex, but not in the
external layer of the pallidum, of the primate brain. The cortical response may
be unique to the primate brain, but c-fos messenger RNA activation within the
striatum has also been reported in the rodent. The effects of L-DOPA probably
depend both on a direct activation of supersensitized dopamine receptors by
dopamine produced in the few remaining, but hyperactive, dopaminergic nerve
terminals and in serotonergic nerve terminals, as well as on indirect actions of 
L-DOPA related to activation of circuitries connecting cerebral cortex and basal 
ganglia structures. These results provide novel information on the mechanisms
underlying L-DOPA's action in the cerebral cortex, striatum and external pallidum
in a primate model of Parkinson's disease.

Dopamine-replacement strategies form the basis of most symptomatic treatments for
Parkinson's disease. However, since long-term dopamine-replacement therapies are 
characterized by many side effects, most notably dyskinesia, the concept of a
nondopaminergic therapy for Parkinson's disease has attracted great interest. To 
date, it has proved difficult to devise a nondopaminergic therapy with efficacy
comparable to that of dopamine replacement. In animal models of Parkinson's
disease, loss of striatal dopamine leads to enhanced excitation of striatal
NR2B-containing NMDA receptors. This is responsible, in part at least, for
generating parkinsonian symptoms. Here we demonstrate that, in the MPTP-lesioned 
marmoset, monotherapy with the NR2B-selective NMDA receptor antagonist,
ifenprodil, administered de novo, has antiparkinsonian effects equivalent to
those of l-DOPA (administered as its methyl ester form). In MPTP-lesioned
marmosets, median mobility scores, following vehicle-treatment were 12.5/h (range
6-21), compared to 61/h (range 26-121) in normal, non-MPTP-lesioned animals.
Following ifenprodil (10 mg/kg) treatment in MPTP-lesioned marmosets, the median 
mobility score was 66/h (range 34-93), and following l-DOPA (10 mg/kg i.p.)
treatment 89/h (range 82-92). The data support the proposal that NR2B-selective
NMDA receptor antagonists have potential as a nondopaminergic monotherapy for the
treatment of parkinsonian symptoms when given de novo.

The novel selective adenosine A(2A) receptor antagonist KW-6002 improves motor
disability in MPTP-treated parkinsonian marmosets without provoking dyskinesia.
In this study we have investigated whether KW-6002 in combination with l-DOPA or 
selective D1 or D2 dopamine receptor agonists enhances antiparkinsonian activity 
in MPTP-treated common marmosets. Combination of KW-6002 with the selective
dopamine D2 receptor agonist quinpirole or the D1 receptor agonist SKF80723
produced an additive improvement in motor disability. Coadministration of KW-6002
with a low dose of L-DOPA also produced an additive improvement in motor
disability, and increased locomotor activity. The ability of KW-6002 to enhance
antiparkinsonian activity was more marked with L-DOPA and quinpirole than with
the D1 agonist. However, despite producing an enhanced antiparkinsonian response 
KW-6002 did not exacerbate L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia in MPTP-treated common
marmosets previously primed to exhibit dyskinesia by prior exposure to L-DOPA.
Selective adenosine A(2A) receptor antagonists, such as KW-6002, may be one means
of reducing the dosage of L-DOPA used in treating Parkinson's disease and are
potentially a novel approach to treating the illness both as monotherapy and in
combination with dopaminergic drugs.

The effect of dopamine depletion from the caudate nucleus of the common marmoset 
(Callithrix jacchus) on tests of prefrontal cognitive function.

Kingdom.

This study examined the effects of depletion of dopamine from the caudate nucleus
of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), on tasks sensitive to prefrontal
damage (attentional set-shifting and spatial delayed response). There was a
marked impairment in performance on the spatial delayed response task, but
performance on the attentional set-shifting task was relatively preserved except 
for an impairment in re-engagement of a previously relevant perceptual dimension.
This pattern of impairment is distinct from that seen after excitotoxic lesions
of the prefrontal cortex and in patients with Parkinson's disease. Though it is
not possible to identify specific cognitive functions that are independent of
dopaminergic modulation of the caudate nucleus, due to the partial nature of the 
lesion, the results do provide insight into those cognitive processes that appear
most dependent on caudate dopamine.

Motor effects of (-)-OSU6162 in primates with unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine
lesions.

The effects of the novel compound, (-)-OSU6162
((S)-(-)-3-methylsulfonylphenyl-1-propylpiperidine), on rotational behavior
induced by dopamine receptor agonists was investigated in common marmosets
(Callithrix jacchus) with unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesions. (-)-OSU6162 per
se displayed no effect on the animals' behavior. On the other hand, pretreatment 
with (-)-OSU6162 attenuated rotational behavior induced by apomorphine
(apomorphini hydrochloridum), L-DOPA (3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine), and the
dopamine D2 receptor agonist, quinpirole (trans-(-)-4aR-4,4a,
5,6,7,8,8a,9-octahydro-5-propyl-1H-pyrazolol[3,4-g]quinoline hydrochloride),
without inducing motor impairment such as akinesia or dystonia. In addition,
treatment with (-)-OSU6162 for 5 consecutive days almost completely abolished the
rotational behavior provoked by apomorphine and produced a transient
subsensitization of such apomorphine-induced effects after it was discontinued.
Moreover, pretreatment with (-)-OSU6162 in two monkeys augmented the rotational
behavior elicited by the dopamine D1 receptor agonists, SKF-81297
(R(+)-6-chloro-7,8,dihydroxy-1-phenyl-2,3,4, 5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepine
hydrobromide) and A-77636 ((-)-(1R,
3S)-3-adamantyl-1-(aminomethyl)-3,4-dihydro-5, 6-dihydroxy-1H-2-benzopyran
hydrochloride). The findings indicate that (-)-OSU6162 can exert indirect
state-dependent effects that differentially affect dopamine D1 and dopamine D2
receptor agonist-induced behavior.

Evaluation of the amount of overall animal movement is important for
investigations of motor control mechanisms in the central nervous system. We
describe a new method to quantify overall free movements of an animal without any
markers using a video camera and a personal computer equipped with a
video-capture board. The operating principle is that the amount of overall
movement of an object can be expressed by the difference in total area occupied
by the object in two consecutive picture frames. The software for this
application operates in real-time. Using this method and with proper setting for 
the cage and recording view, we can estimate three-dimensional movements of
animals. The major advantages are low cost, easy operation and high sensitivity. 
The experimental results indicate that this method can be applied to various
fields of motion analysis.

[Dermal application of lisuride on parkinsonism induced by

Dermal administration is a nonoral drug delivery system that can keep the
concentration of a drug in the body at a proper level for a long time. This is
suitable especially in patients in the advanced stages of Parkinson's disease
with a wearing-off phenomenon (short duration of effects on antiparkinsonian
drugs), or in postoperative patients who cannot be treated with oral
administration. We studied the effects of lisuride, a dopamine receptor agonist, 
in the dermal application on MPTP-treated common marmosets and on 5 patients with
Parkinson's disease. Lisuride was applied to 4 x 5 cm of skin of the abdomen of
monkeys. In patients with Parkinson's disease, lisuride was applied to the skin
of the chest. The agent reversed akinesia of MPTP-treated animals within 30 min
following the application and relieved the animal of parkinsonism for 5 days at a
dose of 2 mg/kg. In patients, the dermal application of lisuride increased the
duration of the ON period at doses of 1 to 2 mg/kg. These results suggest that
the dermal application of lisuride is a useful treatment in parkinsonism.

Adenosine A2A receptors modify motor function in MPTP-treated common marmosets.

Kanda T(1), Tashiro T, Kuwana Y, Jenner P.

Author information: 
(1)Pharmaceutical Research Institute, Kyowa Hakko Kogyo Co Ltd, Shizuoka, Japan.

Both adenosine A1 and A2 receptor populations are located in the striatum and can
modify locomotor activity, and they may form a therapeutic target for Parkinson's
disease (PD). Administration of the selective adenosine A2A antagonist
(E)-1,3-diethyl-8-(3,4-dimethoxystyryl)-7-methyl-3,7-dihydro-1H-pu rine-2,6-dione
(KW-6002) to MPTP-treated common marmosets increased locomotor activity. In
contrast, administration of the selective A1 receptor antagonist
1,3-dipropyl-8-cyclopentylxantine (DPCPX) had no effect on locomotion.
Administration of the adenosine A2A receptor agonist 2-[p-[2-(2-aminoethylamino) 
carbonylethyl] phenethyl amino]-5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (APEC) dose
dependently suppressed basal locomotor activity. A minimally effective dose of
APEC (0.62 mg/kg, i.p) completely reversed the increase in locomotor activity
produced by administration of KW-6002. The adenosine A2A receptor appears to be
an important target for the treatment of basal ganglia disorders, particularly
PD.

Behavioural effects of subthalamic nucleus lesions in the hemiparkinsonian
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).

Repair, University of Cambridge, UK.

Recent studies in non-human primates support a role for the subthalamic nucleus
in the expression of parkinsonian symptomatology, and it has been proposed that
subthalamic lesions may provide a surgical treatment for the symptoms of
Parkinson's disease in humans. We have applied a broad range of behavioural tests
to characterize the effects of lesions of the subthalamic nucleus on parkinsonian
symptoms in the unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesioned marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus). Thirteen marmosets were trained on a battery of behavioural
tasks that were conducted at regular intervals before and after surgery. All
received unilateral 6-OHDA lesions to the medial forebrain bundle. Seven animals 
were then given an additional N-methyl-D-aspartate lesion of the ipsilateral
subthalamic nucleus, whereas the remaining six animals received a variety of
control or sham lesions to the nucleus. The 6-OHDA lesions induced a strong
ipsilateral bias in head position; mild-moderate ipsilateral rotation
spontaneously and after injection of saline or amphetamine; and contralateral
rotation after injection of apomorphine. Hemineglect was evident as delayed
initiation of reaches on the contralateral side on the staircase reaching task.
Additional subthalamic lesions significantly reversed the bias in head position
from ipsilateral to contralateral and decreased neglect as evidenced by improved 
latencies to initiate reaching on the contralateral side at the staircase.
However, deficits in skilled movements persisted in the subthalamic nucleus
lesion group in that they did not complete the staircase task any faster than the
control group and remained impaired on another task which required reaching into 
tubes. These behavioural effects demonstrate that excitotoxic lesioning of the
subthalamic nucleus can ameliorate some, but not all, parkinsonian-like deficits 
in the unilateral 6-OHDA lesioned marmoset.

Adenosine A2A antagonist: a novel antiparkinsonian agent that does not provoke
dyskinesia in parkinsonian monkeys.

Treatment of Parkinson's disease with L-dopa therapy leads to long-term
complications, including loss of drug efficacy and the onset of dyskinesia.
Adenosine A2A receptors in striatum are selectively localized to GABAergic output
neurons of the striato-pallidal pathway and may avoid such problems. The novel
adenosine A2A receptor antagonist KW-6002 has been examined for antiparkinsonian 
activity in MPTP-treated primates. Oral administration of KW-6002 reversed motor 
disability in MPTP-treated common marmosets in a dose-dependent manner. However, 
KW-6002 only modestly increased overall locomotor activity and did not cause
abnormal movement, such as stereotypy. The ability of KW-6002 to reverse motor
disability was maintained on repeated daily administration for 21 days, and no
tolerance was observed. KW-6002 induced little or no dyskinesia in MPTP-treated
primates previously primed to exhibit dyskinesia by prior exposure to L-dopa.
These results suggest that selective adenosine A2A receptor antagonists represent
a new class of antiparkinsonian agents that improve disability without producing 
hyperactivity and without inducing dyskinesia.

De novo administration of ropinirole and bromocriptine induces less dyskinesia
than L-dopa in the MPTP-treated marmoset.

Pearce RK(1), Banerji T, Jenner P, Marsden CD.

Author information: 
(1)Neurodegenerative Diseases Research Centre, Biomedical Sciences Division,

In contrast to levodopa (L-dopa), de novo administration of the D2-like receptor 
agonist bromocriptine to patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) or to
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated subhuman primates is 
not associated with the onset of significant dyskinesia. We now compare the
ability of the novel D2-like selective dopamine agonist ropinirole with that of
bromocriptine and L-dopa to induce dyskinesia in MPTP-treated common marmosets.
MPTP-treated common marmosets were treated with placebo, L-dopa plus carbidopa,
ropinirole, or bromocriptine daily for 30 days (n = 4 per group) in doses that
were titrated to similarly increase locomotion and improve motor disability.
L-dopa rapidly induced dyskinesia of moderate to severe intensity, whereas
ropinirole and bromocriptine produced mild dyskinesia over the course of the
study that was significantly less severe than in the L-dopa-treated group (p <
0.05). However, in a separate group of marmosets previously primed with L-dopa to
exhibit dyskinesia, ropinirole administration elicited severe dyskinesias
comparable with that of L-dopa in a dose-dependent fashion. Ropinirole, in common
with bromocriptine, has a lesser tendency than L-dopa to produce dyskinesia while
similarly improving motor performance in drug-naive MPTP-treated marmosets.
However, in common with other dopamine agonists, ropinirole will elicit
comparable dyskinesia once L-dopa priming has occurred. These results predict a
similar response to ropinirole and other long-acting dopamine agonists in
L-dopa-naive patients with PD and emphasize the importance of avoiding initial
dyskinesia induction through early use of dopamine agonist drugs.

Effects of acute or prolonged administration of cabergoline on parkinsonism
induced by MPTP in common marmosets.

The effects of a single treatment or chronic administration of cabergoline
(1-[(6-allylergolin-8beta-yl)carbonyl]-1-[3-(dimethylamino)p
ropyl]-3-ethyl-urea), a potent, long-lasting dopamine receptor agonist, on
parkinsonism induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) in
common marmosets were studied. The administration of 0.2 mg/kg or a higer dose of
cabergoline began to reverse parkinsonism-like symptoms 60 min after a
subcutaneous injection, and showed steady and constant effects throughout the
observation period. For prolonged administration, 0.2 mg/kg cabergoline was
injected daily for 22 consecutive days. Locomotor activity in MPTP-treated
animals increased until it reached its peak on the third day, then it gradually
decreased. Akinesia scores, rating the quality of movements, were also improved, 
and the improvement was sustained up to the last day of chronic administration.
None of the animals developed abnormal behaviors after either acute or chronic
administration. These results suggest that cabergoline has long-acting effects in
the marmoset model of parkinsonism, and that it will be a useful agent for the
treatment of Parkinson's disease, particularly in cases with fluctuating motor
disabilities.

Survival of nigral grafts within the striatum of marmosets with 6-OHDA lesions
depends critically on donor embryo age.

Dunnett SB.

Author information:

The study examined the importance of embryonic donor age for the survival of
nigral grafts in 6-OHDA-lesioned marmosets. The issue as to whether donor age is 
critical for the survival of nigral grafts in primates is controversial, because 
several early reports suggested that relatively old tissue could survive
transplantation and produce functional benefits in monkeys, in contrast to the
restrictive time dependence observed in rodents. Embryonic marmoset donors
embryos of three different ages were employed: 1) E74 (Carnegie stage 18-19); 2) 
E83-84 (Carnegie stage 23+); 3) E92-93 (foetal period). The nigral neurons
derived from the ventral mesencephalon in the two older donor age groups did not 
survive well when grafted to the striatum of adult marmosets with unilateral
6-OHDA lesions. Although a few tyrosine hydroxylase (TH+) neurons could be
identified by immunohistochemistry at graft sites in all recipients in older
donor age groups, the numbers of surviving neurons in these were small, on
average typically less than 100 TH+ cells. These small grafts were not sufficient
to affect amphetamine-induced rotation. In contrast, many more TH+ cells
typically survived transplantation in the recipients of graft tissue derived from
the youngest donors and amphetamine-induced rotation was significantly reduced in
this group alone. The time course and extent of the reduction in rotation was
remarkably similar to that observed in previous marmoset nigral graft studies,
confirming the utility of amphetamine-induced rotation as a sensitive and
reliable indicator of nigral graft function in this species. Considering these
results and other recent evidence from monkey to monkey, human to rat, and human 
to human graft studies, the survival of embryonic nigral tissues derived from
primate donors transplanted into the striatum does appear to be critically
dependent on the age of the donor tissue.

(-)-OSU 6162 inhibits levodopa-induced dyskinesias in a monkey model of
Parkinson's disease.

Ekesbo A(1), Andrén PE, Gunne LM, Tedroff J.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Neurology, University Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden.

We have studied the effects of two D2 dopamine receptor-selective compounds,
(-)-OSU 6162 and raclopride, on levodopa-induced dyskinesias in
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-lesioned common marmosets
(Callithrix jacchus). Three monkeys developed a severe parkinsonian syndrome
following administration of MPTP. In response to daily levodopa treatment the
animals developed reproducible and idiosyncratic peak-dose dyskinesias.
Pretreatment with (-)-OSU 6162 and raclopride, in doses increased by multiples of
three, both dose-dependently relieved the levodopa-induced dyskinesias. However, 
in contrast to when raclopride pretreatment was given, (-)-OSU 6162 pretreatment 
did not induce akinesia. Our investigation suggests that (-)-OSU 6162 may be
useful an an adjuvant treatment to levodopa in advanced Parkinson's disease to
selectively combat levodopa-induced dyskinesias without affecting the
antiparkinsonian response.

Reversal of parkinsonian symptoms in primates by antagonism of excitatory amino
acid transmission: potential mechanisms of action.

Mitchell IJ(1), Carroll CB.

Author information: 
(1)School of Psychology, University of Birmingham, UK.

Parkinsonism is characterised by overactive glutamatergic transmission in the
cortico-striatal and subthalamo-medial pallidal pathways. Local blockade of
glutamatergic transmission in these pathways can alleviate parkinsonian symptoms.
The effectiveness of the treatment, however, is often limited by the simultaneous
appearance of unwanted side-effects. These side-effects, including ataxia and
dissociative anaesthesia, are particularly problematic when N-methyl-D-aspartate 
(NMDA) antagonists are used. In an attempt to overcome these problems we have
attempted to manipulate excitatory amino acid (EAA)-mediated neurotransmission
indirectly by targeting the NMDA receptor associated modulatory sites. We review 
evidence which demonstrates that antagonists for both the NMDA associated glycine
and polyamine sites can reverse parkinsonian symptoms when injected
intra-cerebrally in both MPTP-treated and bilateral 6-OHDA lesioned marmosets
without eliciting unwanted side-effects. We further review preliminary data which
suggest that ifenprodil, a polyamine site antagonist, has striking
anti-parkinsonian actions in the marmoset. Potential mechanisms of action
underlying these effects are discussed in terms of NMDA receptor subtypes and the
neuroanatomical locus of action. The anti-parkinsonian efficacy of
intra-striatally administered EAA antagonists leads us to question the view of
dopamine acting in the striatum as a simple neuromodulator.

1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-induced neurotoxicity in non-human
primates is antagonized by pretreatment with nimodipine at the nigral, but not at
the striatal level.

The neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) has been shown
to induce parkinsonism in man and non-human primates. Hypotheses concerning the
mechanism of action of MPTP have been related to the pathogenesis of nigral cell 
death in Parkinson's disease. For instance, alterations of calcium influxes have 
been reported to be implicated in both MPTP-induced parkinsonism and Parkinson's 
disease. Recently, we reported that nimodipine, a blocker of L-type calcium
channels, prevents dopaminergic MPTP-induced neurotoxicity in C57B1/6 black mice.
The present study extended these rodent findings to the non-human primate model
of Parkinson's disease and assessed the effects of nimodipine, continuously
applied by pellet for 18 days, on behavioural, biochemical and histological
parameters, following systemic application of MPTP in common marmosets
(Callithrix jacchus). The experimental design involved five groups of common
marmosets and a total of 24 animals. Monkeys assigned to group I (n = 4) received
subcutaneously implanted vehicle pellets 7 days prior to subcutaneous saline
injections (control). Monkeys of group II (n = 4) were treated with nimodipine
pellets (80 mg) and saline injections. Marmosets in group III (n = 8) were
treated with vehicle pellets and received 4 times MPTP (MPTP-HCl, 2 mg/kg body
weight subcutaneously, separated by an interval of 24 h for a total of 4 days).
Monkeys in group IV (n = 4) and V (n = 4) were treated as group-III animals
except for the implantation of nimodipine pellets (80 mg and 120 mg,
respectively) 7 days prior to toxin exposure. In common marmosets MPTP induced
severe parkinsonian symptoms, a pronounced dopamine depletion in the
caudate-putamen (more than 99% of control) and a loss of tyrosine hydroxylase
immunoreactive cells in the substantia nigra (50% percent of control) 7 days
after MPTP-administration. Pretreatment with nimodipine (120 mg pellets) did
neither attenuate the behavioural impairments in MPTP-treated animals nor
antagonize the striatal neurotoxin-induced dopamine depletion, but almost
completely prevented (in a dose-dependent manner) the MPTP-induced decrease of
nigral tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactive cells. These data suggest that
application of nimodipine, during the observation period of 7 days, protects
against MPTP-induced neurotoxicity in common marmosets at the cellular nigral
level, but not at the synaptic striatal level, implicating differential
mechanisms of actions of MPTP-induced neurotoxicity at the nigral versus the
striatal level.

An appraisal of the antiparkinsonian activity of piribedil in
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-treated common marmosets.

UK.

The D2 dopamine agonist piribedil is not widely used in the treatment of
Parkinson's disease because it was thought to be effective mainly on parkinsonian
tremor and to produce a high incidence of peripheral side effects, particular
nausea. In this study, we used 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine
(MPTP)-treated primates to reevaluate the antiparkinsonian ability of piribedil
after its oral administration in the presence or absence of domperidone
pretreatment. Adult common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) were treated with the
nigral toxin MPTP to induce a parkinsonian syndrome characterised primarily by
bradykinesia and other motor deficits. Oral administration of a solution of
piribedil [1-(3,4-methylenedioxybenzyl)-4-(2-pyrimidinyl)piperazine] produced a
dose-related reversal of all MPTP locomotor and behavioural deficits. However,
this effect was short lived and associated with unwanted effects, particular
nausea and retching, which clearly hindered locomotion. In contrast, after
pretreatment with the peripheral dopamine antagonist domperidone, administration 
of piribedil did not induce nausea or retching in MPTP-treated marmosets. In
these animals, piribedil caused a more marked and longer lasting enhancement of
locomotor activity and a further reduction in behavioural deficits than that
observed after administration of piribedil alone. In addition, piribedil induced 
increased vigilance and awareness. These data show that piribedil can reverse
akinesia and rigidity in MPTP-treated primates. In addition, they show the drug
to be effective without peripheral side effects when used in conjunction with
domperidone. These data indicate that piribedil should be an effective
monotherapy for Parkinson's disease.

(-)-Trans 9,10-hydroxy-2-propyl-4,5,5a,6,7,11b-hexahydro-3-thia-5-
azacyclopent-1-ena[c]phenanthrene hydrochloride (A-86929) is a potent and
selective full agonist at the dopamine (DA) D1-like receptor. Judging by its
binding affinities to the D1 and D2 classes of receptors, the compound is
approximately 20-fold D1 receptor-selective, whereas relative potencies based on 
functional in vitro assays indicate that A-86929 is greater than 400-fold
D1-selective. A-86929 has moderate to weak (Ki > 1 microM) affinity at other
monoaminergic and peptidergic receptors, at ion channels and at monoamine uptake 
sites. The catechol of A-86929 was bis-acetylated to produce the prodrug,
(-)-trans 9,10-acetoxy-2-propyl-4,5,5a,6,7,11-b-hexahydro-3-thia-
5-azacyclopent-1-ena[c]phenanthrene hydrochloride (ABT-431), which is more
chemically stable yet is rapidly converted to the parent compound with a
half-life of less than 1 min in plasma. Both A-86929 and ABT-431 produced
contralateral rotation in rats bearing unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesions, with
ED50 values of 0.24 mumol/kg s.c. and 0.54 mumol/kg s.c., respectively. A-86929
and ABT-431 improved behavioral disability scores and increased locomotor
activity in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-lesioned marmoset
model of Parkinson's disease in a dose-dependent manner (the minimum effective
dose was 0.10 mumol/kg s.c.). When administered three times daily for 30
consecutive days to 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-lesioned
marmosets, A-86929 significantly improved disability scores throughout the
duration of the study. Current Parkinson's disease therapy includes L-dopa, which
stimulates both classes of DA receptors by virtue of its conversion to DA in
vivo, and direct-acting D2-selective agonists. Stimulation of the D2 receptor,
which is associated with all current DA agonist-based therapies, may contribute
to their dose-limiting side effects. An agent such as A-86929 (or its prodrug
ABT-431), which selectively stimulates the D1 receptor, may represent a novel
mechanism for Parkinson's disease therapy with the potential for an improved
side-effect profile and, consequently, improved patient compliance.

Chronic L-DOPA administration induces dyskinesias in the 1-methyl-4-
phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-treated common marmoset (Callithrix Jacchus).

Dyskinesias occur in the majority of patients with Parkinson's disease
chronically treated with L-DOPA and also occur in several nonhuman primate
species after 1-methyl-4phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) and L-DOPA
treatment. The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) shows parkinsonian motor
deficits after MPTP administration, and we now report dyskinesias occurring in
this species during chronic L-DOPA exposure. Marmosets rendered chronically
parkinsonian after MPTP administration were treated orally with L-DOPA plus
carbidopa for 3 weeks. After several days the animals began to display chorea,
choreoathetosis, and dystonia. The severity of dyskinesias varied between the
animals, with the most severely parkinsonian animals displaying the most
dyskinetic movements. Each animal showed an idiosyncratic pattern of dyskinesias,
which was highly reproducible. These L-DOPA-primed animals also received other D2
D1, and mixed D1/D2 agonist drugs. Quinpirole, bromocriptine, pergolide,
apomorphine, and A-77636 all produce dyskinesias that were identical in character
to those seen after L-DOPA administration, but the D1 agonist A-77636 gradually
abolished dyskinesias while preserving its antiparkinsonian activity. The
MPTP-treated marmoset provides a useful model in which to study dyskinesias in
Parkinson's disease and to examine new therapeutic strategies aimed at
alleviating this common side effect of chronic dopamine replacement therapy.

[Application of the common marmoset to pharmacological studies].

Application of the common marmoset to pharmacological studies was reviewed,
especially employment of the animal as a model of Parkinson's disease were
presented. The common marmoset is one of the New World monkeys with a body weight
of 300-350 g. It is small enough to be easily handled and to be kept as a group
in a room. In the fields of pharmacology, it has been used in studies of plasma
renin activity inhibitors, lipoprotein, memory/learning, obstetrics,
transplantation, toxicology, anxiolytic agents and virology/immunology. We showed
that the common marmoset was a useful animal for studies on Parkinson's disease, 
dopamine metabolism by microdialysis and nausea/vomiting. The common marmoset was
sensitive to 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) and developed
permanent parkinsonism after MPTP injection. MPTP-treated common marmosets showed
tremor and akinesia, and it remarkably responded to antiparkinsonian agents. A
dopamine D1 agonist, which caused stereotyped behavior in rats, did not reverse
parkinsonism in humans. We showed this agent did not have any antiparkinsonian
effects on MPTP-treated common marmosets. MAO has subtypes, A and B, that have
differences of distribution in different species. MAO type B inhibitors were
applied for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. MAO subtype B inhibitors do not
cause any change in behavior or extracellular concentration of dopamine or its
metabolites in rodents. In MPTP-treated common marmosets, however, administration
of a MAO type B inhibitor increased the antiparkinsonian effects of levodopa and 
decreased dopamine metabolites. The common marmoset is a suitable animal for the 
study of MAO type B inhibitors.

Functional implications of kappa opioid receptor-mediated modulation of glutamate
transmission in the output regions of the basal ganglia in rodent and primate
models of Parkinson's disease.

Manchester, UK.

Parkinson's disease is characterized by an increased excitatory amino acid
transmission in the internal segment of the globus pallidus and the substantia
nigra pars reticulata. The effects of the kappa receptor agonist enadoline
(CI-977) on glutamate transmission were investigated in vitro. Enadoline reduced 
the K(+)-evoked release of glutamate from slices of substantia nigra in a
concentration-dependent manner (maximum effect: 78% inhibition at 200 microM).
This effect was blocked by the selective kappa receptor antagonist
nor-binaltorphimine. The endogenous ligand for kappa receptors is thought to be
dynorphin. Dynorphin released from terminals of striato-pallidal and
striato-nigral pathways might thus act as an endogenous modulatory agent on
glutamatergic transmission in the basal ganglia. In vivo experiments were carried
out in rodent and primate models of Parkinson's disease to assess the potential
of manipulating kappa receptors as a potential treatment for Parkinson's disease.
Enadoline reduced reserpine-induced akinesia when injected in the entopeduncular 
nucleus of the rat. Similarly, injections of CI-977 in the internal segment of
globus pallidus (GPi) of the MPTP-treated marmoset alleviated parkinsonian
symptoms and allowed the animal to recover its locomotor activity. This suggest
that reducing the overactive glutamatergic transmission in the output regions of 
the basal ganglia by activating kappa receptors might potentially form the basis 
of a novel anti-parkinsonian therapy.

Short- and long-term changes in striatal and extrastriatal dopamine uptake sites 
in the MPTP-treated common marmoset.

The 'short-term' (15-30 days) and 'long-term' (18-42 months) effects of the
systemic administration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) on
[3H]mazindol binding to dopamine uptake sites was investigated in the common
marmoset. In the 'short-term' MPTP-treated group, [3H]mazindol binding was
reduced in the caudate-putamen (by -82 to -98% with respect to controls),
substantia nigra pars compacta (-71 to -84%), ventral tegmental area (-72%) and
nucleus accumbens (-54%). [3H]Mazindol binding in the globus pallidus, frontal
cortex and substantia nigra pars reticulata was much lower and was unaffected by 
MPTP treatment. In the 'long-term' MPTP-treated group [3H]mazindol binding was
still greatly reduced in the substantia nigra pars compacta (by -76 to -89%),
ventral tegmental area (-71%) and most of the caudate-putamen (-69 to -98%),
although the reduction in [3H]mazindol binding in the nucleus accumbens (-27%)
and rostroventral caudate nucleus (-69%) was less than in the 'short-term'
MPTP-treated group. The motor deficits induced by MPTP treatment in the common
marmoset are largely reversible with increasing survival times (Ueki et al.,
1989, Neuropharmacology 28, 1089). In the present study, the apparent 'recovery' 
in [3H]mazindol binding in the rostroventral caudate nucleus and nucleus
accumbens may indicate regeneration of dopamine neurone terminals in these
regions and this may contribute to the behavioural recovery seen in this primate 
model of Parkinson's disease.

The differential behavioural effects of benzazepine D1 dopamine agonists with
varying efficacies, co-administered with quinpirole in primate and rodent models 
of Parkinson's disease.

College, London, U.K.

The effects of co-administration of quinpirole with benzazepine D1 dopamine (DA) 
agonists possessing full/supramaximal (SKF 80723 and SKF 82958), partial (SKF
38393 and SKF 75670) and no efficacies (SKF 83959) in stimulating adenylate
cyclase (AC) were investigated in rodent and primate models of Parkinson's
disease (PD). In rats with a unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesion of the 
medial forebrain bundle, co-administration of SKF 38393
(7,8-dihydroxy-1-phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepine), SKF 75670 (3-CH3
analogue), SKF 80723 (6-Br analogue), SKF 83959 (6-Cl, 3-CH3, 3'-CH3 analogue)
and SKF 82958 (6-Cl, 3-C3H5 analogue) strongly potentiated the contralateral
circling induced by quinpirole. In MPTP
(1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) treated common marmosets,
administration of quinpirole alone increased locomotor activity and reversed
motor deficits. Grooming and oral activity were unaltered. Co-administration of
SKF 38393 and SKF 75670 inhibited the quinpirole-induced changes in locomotor
activity and motor disability. The combined treatment of SKF 80723 or SKF 82958
with quinpirole had no overall effect on locomotor activity or motor disability. 
In contrast, SKF 83959 extended the duration of the quinpirole-induced increase
in locomotor activity with corresponding decreases in motor disability.
Co-administration of high doses of SKF 82958 and more especially SKF 83959 and
SKF 80723, with quinpirole induced hyperexcitability and seizures. Oral activity 
and grooming were unaltered following the co-administration of benzazepine
derivatives with quinpirole. The ability of some benzazepine D1 DA agonists to
prolong the antiparkinsonian effects of quinpirole in the MPTP-treated marmoset
may indicate a role for certain D1 DA agonists in the clinical treatment of PD.
In general, the behavioural responses to the combined administration of
benzazepines with quinpirole in the 6-OHDA lesioned rat and more especially the
MPTP-treated marmoset failed to correlate with their ability to stimulate AC.
These observations further implicate a behavioural role for D1 DA receptors not
linked to AC.

In common marmosets systemically treated with MPTP
(1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine), the behavioural effects of
benzazepine D1 dopamine (DA) agonists with full/supramaximal (SKF 80723 and SKF
82958), partial (SKF 38393, SKF 75670 and SKF 83565) and no efficacies (SKF
83959) in stimulating adenylate cyclase (AC) activity were investigated. The
benzazepine derivatives, with the exception of SKF 82958 (8 fold D1 DA receptor
selectivity), demonstrated high D1 DA receptor affinity and selectivity
(approximately 100 fold or more) in rat striatal homogenates. Administration of
MPTP in marmosets induced locomotor hypoactivity, rigidity and motor disability. 
SKF 38393 (7,8-dihydroxy-1-phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3- benzazepine) and SKF
75670 (3-CH3 analogue) further reduced locomotor activity (by -70 to -80%) and
increased motor disability (by +22 to +67%) in these animals. SKF 83565 (6-Cl,
3-CH3, 3'-Cl analogue) and SKF 82958 (6-Cl, 3-C3H5 analogue) had only a slight
effect on locomotor activity but decreased motor disability at high doses (-46 to
-60%). In contrast, SKF 83959 (6-Cl, 3-CH3, 3'-CH3 analogue) and SKF 80723 (6-Br 
analogue) produced pronounced increases in locomotion (6-10 fold) and a reversal 
in motor disability (by -64 to -77%). Oral activity, consisting largely of
abnormal, 'dyskinetic' tongue protrusions and vacuous chews, was increased in
animals treated with SKF 38393, SKF 83565, SKF 82958 and more especially with SKF
80723 and SKF 83959. Grooming was increased with SKF 82958 and more especially
with SKF 80723 and SKF 83959. In contrast, quinpirole (D2 DA agonist), reversed
the MPTP-induced motor deficits in the marmoset, with no effect on grooming and
oral activity. The present findings further demonstrate the antiparkinsonian
actions of some D1 DA agonists in MPTP-treated primates. However, in general the 
behavioural effects of benzazepines failed to correlate with either their D1 DA
receptor affinity/selectivity or their efficacy in stimulating adenylate cyclase 
(AC) activity. These observations further implicate a behavioural role for D1 DA 
receptors uncoupled to AC and/or a role for extrastriatal D1 DA receptors in
mediating the behavioural response to D1 DA agonists.

Selective dopamine antagonist pretreatment on the antiparkinsonian effects of

In rats with unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesions of the medial
forebrain bundle, pretreatment with the D1 DA antagonists, SCH 23390
(7-chloro-8-hydroxy-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-3-methyl-1-phenyl-1H-3-benzazepin e) and
A66359 (1- 2-bromo-4,5-dimethoxybenzyl]-7-hydroxy-6-methoxy-2-methyl- 1,2,3,4
tetrahydroisoquinoline), but not the D2 DA antagonist raclopride inhibited the
contralateral circling induced by the benzazepine D1 DA agonists SKF 38393 (7-H, 
3-H analogue of SCH 23390), SKF 80723 (7-H, 3-H, 6-Br analogue) and SKF 83959
(7-H, 6-Cl, 3'-CH3 analogue). In MPTP
(1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) treated common marmosets,
administration of SKF 80723 and SKF 83959 increased locomotor activity and
reversed the motor disability. Grooming and oral activities were also increased. 
Pretreatment with SCH 23390 and A66359 inhibited all the behavioural changes
induced by both D1 DA agonists. In general, higher doses of A66359 and more
especially SCH 23390 were needed to inhibit SKF 83959 and SKF 80723 induced
increases in oral activity and grooming than locomotor activity. Raclopride
pretreatment did not affect SKF 83959 and SKF 80723 induced oral activity and
grooming, though it reduced the duration of the locomotor changes induced by the 
D1 DA agonists. These findings demonstrate that the behavioural effects of
benzazepine D1 DA agonists in the 6-OHDA lesioned rat and MPTP-treated marmoset
are mediated by D1 DA receptor sites, although in the primate, stimulation of D2 
DA receptors by endogenous DA may be necessary in facilitating the
antiparkinsonian effects of D1 DA agonists. The differential sensitivities of
locomotor/motor disability and oral/grooming behaviours to antagonism by D1 DA
antagonists may indicate the involvement of multiple D1 DA receptor subtypes in
mediating benzazepine D1 DA agonist induced behaviours in the MPTP-treated
marmoset.

Antiparkinsonian activity of talipexole in MPTP-treated monkeys: in combination
with L-dopa and as chronic treatment.

We examined whether or not the antiparkinsonian activity of talipexole (B-HT 920,
6-allyl-2-amino-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-4H-thiazolo[4,5-d]-azepine) could be optimised
by combination with L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-dopa). Additionally, the
effects of chronic treatment with talipexole on motor behavior were investigated 
using 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated and normal
common marmosets. Administration of MPTP (0.5 mg/animal i.v. once or twice) to
marmosets induced persistent parkinsonian motor deficits. The antiparkinsonian
activity of talipexole (40 micrograms/kg s.c.) was significantly enhanced by its 
combination with L-dopa (30 mg/kg i.p.). This may further support the postulated 
postsynaptic dopamine D2 receptor agonist properties of talipexole. Chronic
treatment with talipexole (a daily dose of 40 micrograms/kg s.c. for 21 days) did
not lead to tolerance to the antiparkinsonian activity in MPTP-treated animals.
No obvious dyskinesia was seen throughout the chronic treatment. In contrast, in 
normal marmosets, talipexole at a dose of 80 micrograms/kg which is a dose
sufficient to induce hyperactivity did not increase motor activity during the
treatment repeated for 21 days. These results suggest that talipexole is a
selective dopamine D2 receptor agonist drug of potential use in the treatment of 
Parkinson's disease.

The effects of bifemelane on parkinsonism were shown in MPTP-treated common
marmosets. The administration of bifemelane increased locomotor activity in
MPTP-treated marmosets but not in normal control marmosets. In a microdialysis
study, extracellular levels of dopamine and its metabolites increased following
the administration of bifemelane. These results indicate that it is worth
studying the effects of bifemelane hydrochloride on patients with Parkinson's
disease.

Behavioral assessment of the effects of embryonic nigral grafts in marmosets with
unilateral 6-OHDA lesions of the nigrostriatal pathway.

Kingdom.

Grafts of embryonic nigral tissue were made into the striatum of marmosets
(Callithrix jacchus) which had previously received a unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine
(6-OHDA) lesion of the nigrostriatal bundle. The grafts comprised injections of
cell suspensions prepared from embryonic (74 day) marmoset ventral mesencephalic 
tissue targeted at multiple striatal sites in the caudate nucleus, the putamen,
and the nucleus accumbens on the same side as the initial lesion. A series of
behavioral tests was used to assess the monkeys prior to surgery, following the
6-OHDA lesion, and at regular intervals for 6 months after transplantation
surgery. Lesioned and grafted (n = 6) or lesion alone (n = 4) monkeys were
matched as far as possible with respect to their scores prior to transplantation 
so that explicit graft-derived recovery could be distinguished from any
spontaneous recovery that might occur. Sham-lesioned or unoperated monkeys served
as further controls (n = 5). The grafts were functionally effective as measured
by a reduction, and in some cases a reversal, of spontaneous, amphetamine- and
apomorphine-induced rotation. The reversal of amphetamine-induced rotation
correlated with the number of dopaminergic neurons in the grafts visualized by
tyrosine hydroxylase immunohistochemistry. Successful use of the hands was
restored by the grafts on tasks in which the monkeys reached into tubes to
retrieve food. However, functional recovery was not seen on some other behavioral
tests. In particular, grafts did not influence ipsilateral biases induced by the 
lesion, including the position of the head with respect to the rest of the body, 
hand preference while reaching for food at a conveyor belt, and neglect of
contralateral stimuli either at the conveyor belt or of adhesive labels placed
around the feet. Indeed, the graft group was impaired compared with the lesion
group in the accuracy of reaches at the conveyor belt. Overall, these results
indicate that embryonic nigral grafts can yield a partial recovery from the
symptoms induced by unilateral nigrostriatal lesions in a primate model of
hemiparkinsonism.

The behavioural, biochemical and morphological effects of a chronic
administration of low doses of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine
(MPTP) were studied in the common marmoset. Monkeys received the toxin (1 mg/kg
i.p.) twice a week for four months. Group A monkeys were studied one week after
the last injection of MPTP; group B monkeys were studied eight months after the
last toxic injection. The monkey behaviour was observed throughout the
experiment; the biochemical and morphological correlates were studied post mortem
in the neostriatum and in the substantia nigra, respectively. Data collected from
MPTP-treated marmosets were compared to those obtained from sham-injected control
monkeys. The results can be summarized as follows. (1) In all MPTP-treated
marmosets a progressive Parkinsonism occurred. In group B monkeys, a gradual
behavioural recovery was observed after MPTP was discontinued. (2) Biochemical
analysis of group A marmosets showed a depletion of dopamine, of
3,4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid and of homovanillic acid, and no variations in
dopamine turnover in the neostriatum of MPTP-treated marmosets. In group B,
biochemical analysis showed no differences between controls and MPTP-treated
animals. (3) Morphological analysis showed that the density of midbrain
dopaminergic neurons located in the substantia nigra was unchanged in group A
monkeys, but was reduced by 6.8% in MPTP-treated monkeys of group B. The
measurement of cross-sectional area showed that midbrain dopaminergic neurons
were swollen in MPTP-treated monkeys of group A, with a 11.0% increase of cell
size as compared to controls. In group A the nuclei were also swollen, being
304.8% larger in MPTP-treated monkeys, with a nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio of 65.9%
(as compared to 34.0% of controls). In group B monkeys cell size was increased by
18.4% in MPTP-treated marmosets, but the nuclei were of comparable size. The
present data show that a chronic administration of low doses of MPTP brings about
biochemical and morphological abnormalities. The first occur acutely in terminals
and are reverted early after discontinuance of exposure to the toxin; the latter 
occur in dopaminergic perikarya, last longer than biochemical abnormalities and, 
at variance with them, increase in severity after MPTP is discontinued.
Morphological abnormalities include early events, such as a transient swelling of
nuclei or a long-lasting swelling of neurons, and late events, such as a decrease
in the number of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive perikarya.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT

Administration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP, 0.5
mg/animal i.v. once or twice) to common marmosets induced persistent parkinsonian
motor deficits. The postsynaptic dopamine D2 receptor agonist properties of
talipexole (B-HT 920,
2-amino-6-allyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-4H-thiazolo[4,5-d]-azepine), which is believed
to be a dopamine autoreceptor agonist, were examined using normal and
MPTP-treated marmosets and were compared to these properties of bromocriptine, a 
selective dopamine D2 receptor agonist. Talipexole (20-160 micrograms/kg i.p.)
dose dependently increased motor activity and reversed the akinesia and
incoordination of movement in MPTP-treated marmosets. In normal marmosets, higher
doses of talipexole (80-160 micrograms/kg i.p.) produced a dose-dependent
increase in motor activity, while the lowest dose (20 micrograms/kg i.p.)
depressed this activity. These data for talipexole were very similar to those for
bromocriptine. Talipexole had, however, several properties different from those
of bromocriptine; it had a rapid onset of antiparkinsonian activity compared to
bromocriptine; it had more than 25 times as much activity potency as
bromocriptine; a dose of talipexole (80 micrograms/kg i.p.) sufficient to produce
the activity did not induce emesis as strongly as an insufficient dose of
bromocriptine (0.5 mg/kg i.p.). These results suggest that talipexole has
postsynaptic dopamine D2 receptor agonist properties and that these properties of
talipexole may be favorable in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.

Alterations in striatal and extrastriatal D-1 and D-2 dopamine receptors in the
MPTP-treated common marmoset: an autoradiographic study.

In adult common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus), MPTP
(1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) treatment induced almost total
depletion of cells in the substantia nigra pars compacts (SNc) but partial cell
loss in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). There was severe depletion of
[3H]-mazindol binding to dopamine (DA) uptake sites in the caudate, putamen, and 
SNc. The loss of [3H]-mazindol binding in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and
olfactory tubercle (OT) was less marked. [3H]-mazindol binding in the body of
caudate nucleus showed a small but significant recovery with increasing
post-lesion survival times. The specific binding of [3H]-SCH 23390 to D-1 DA
receptor sites was increased after MPTP treatment in all subregions of both
caudate and putamen but was unaltered in the NAc and OT. Substantia nigra pars
reticulata (SNr), frontal cortex, and medial segment of globus pallidus (GPm) all
demonstrated moderate levels of [3H]-SCH 23390 binding in control animals, which 
were unaffected by MPTP treatment. Specific [3H]-spiperone binding to D-2 DA
receptor sites was not altered by MPTP treatment in the subregions of
caudate-putamen. Moderate levels of [3H]-spiperone binding were observed in
control animals in the NAc, OT, SNc, and the lateral segment of globus pallidus
(GP1). [3H]-spiperone binding in the SNc and OT was partially decreased in
MPTP-treated animals. The changes in specific [3H]-spiperone and [3H]-SCH 23390
binding induced by MPTP-treatment did not alter with post-lesion survival times. 
These results demonstrate that MPTP treatment causes greater dopaminergic
denervation of the caudate-putamen than in NAc/OT. This resulted in an increase
in postsynaptic D-1 DA receptor sites in the caudate-putamen but not in the
NAc/OT. Also, there appeared to be loss of presynaptic D-2 DA receptor sites in
the SNc and OT. In the caudate-putamen, the loss of presynaptic D-2 DA receptor
sites may have masked postsynaptic D-2 DA receptor upregulation.

A selective MAOB inhibitor Ro19-6327 potentiates the effects of levodopa on
parkinsonism induced by MPTP in the common marmoset.

Nomoto M(1), Fukuda T.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pharmacology, Kagoshima University School of Medicine, Japan.

The effects of the selective and reversible MAOB inhibitor Ro19-6327 on
parkinsonism in common marmosets, induced by MPTP were studied. Combined
administration of Ro19-6327 with benserazide/levodopa potentiated the effects of 
levodopa to reverse akinesia. In a microdialysis study, the administration of
Ro19-6327 was found to minimize the increase in metabolites of dopamine (DA)
following injection of levodopa. These results suggest that Ro19-6327 suppresses 
the metabolism of DA, resulting in increased effects of levodopa on parkinsonism 
induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). Thus, Ro19-6327
should be useful in the treatment of patients with Parkinson's disease.

A-77636, ((1R,3S)
3-(1'-adamantyl)-1-aminomethyl-3,4-dihydro-5,6-dihydroxy-1H-2-benz opyran
hydrochloride), is a selective dopamine D1 receptor agonist. In a battery of
receptor binding assays, A-77636 shows the highest affinity (pKi = 7.40 +/- 0.09;
Ki = 39.8 nM) for the dopamine D1 receptor. A-77636 is an agonist at the dopamine
D1 receptors in the fish retina (pEC50 = 8.13; EC50 = 1.1 nM; intrinsic activity 
= 102% of dopamine) and the rat caudate-putamen (pEC50 = 8.97; intrinsic activity
= 134% of dopamine). The compound is functionally inactive at dopamine D2
receptors (EC50 > 10 microM). In rats with unilateral 6-OHDA (6-hydroxydopamine) 
lesions of the nigro-striatal dopaminergic pathway, A-77636 elicits prolonged (> 
20 h) contralateral turning that is blocked by SCH 23390, a D1 receptor
antagonist, but not by haloperidol at doses selective for the dopamine D2
receptor. Higher doses of A-77636 produce forelimb clonus in rats and mice. When 
tested in marmosets treated with MPTP to induce a parkinsonian-like state,
A-77636 increases locomotor activity and decreases the severity of the
parkinsonian-like symptoms: the compound is active after either subcutaneous or
oral administration. A-77641, the optical antipode of A-77636, has a lower
affinity towards the dopamine D1 receptor (pKi = 5.14, Ki = 7200 nM), is less
potent as a dopamine D1 receptor agonist (pEC50 = 5.65; EC50 = 2200 nM), fails to
elicit turning in the 6-OHDA-lesioned rat, and lacks antiparkinsonian efficacy in
the MPTP-treated marmoset.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Dopamine D1 and D2 receptor interactions in the MPTP-treated marmoset.

Hertfordshire, UK.

In a modified MPTP model of Parkinson's disease in the marmoset, both L-DOPA and 
the dopamine D2 agonist quinpirole were found to exhibit anti-bradykinetic
activity. Both the dopamine D1 agonist SKF38393 and the D1 antagonist SCH23390
reduced the anti-bradykinetic action of L-DOPA and quinpirole. These results are 
discussed with respect to partial agonist activity of SKF38393 and the
possibility that other dopamine receptors may be required for anti-Parkinsonian
drug activity.

The mixed dopamine (DA) agonist/antagonist terguride acts as a DA antagonist on
normosensitive receptors but shows DA agonistic properties at supersensitive DA
receptors. Such a compound could offer an alternative to the treatment of
Parkinson's disease with indirect or direct DA agonists. The present study
compares the actions of terguride, 4-12 mg/kg i.p., in naive common marmosets
with its effects in animals rendered parkinsonian by administration of
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), 2 months or 10 months
previously, in order to test its antiparkinsonian efficacy. Terguride reduced
locomotor activity in naive common marmosets, similar to its effects in rodents
and in line with the DA antagonistic activity of the compound. In marmosets
treated with MPTP 2 months previously and exhibiting pronounced behavioural motor
deficits, terguride stimulated locomotor activity, showing DA agonistic
properties under these conditions. In contrast, the locomotor activity of animals
that had recovered from MPTP treatment 10 months previously was not altered by
terguride. It is concluded that terguride has anti-akinetic efficacy in this
primate model of Parkinson's disease. In addition, terguride offers a unique
opportunity to differentiate, pharmacologically, the extent of dopaminergic
recovery from MPTP treatment in this primate species.

Parkinson's disease: pathological mechanisms and actions of piribedil.

Jenner P(1).

Author information: 
(1)Parkinson's Disease Society Experimental Research Laboratories, King's College
London, UK.

The cause of the degeneration of dopamine-containing cells in the zona compacta
of the substantia nigra in Parkinson's disease remains unknown. The ability of
the selective nigral toxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6 tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)
(via its metabolite MPP+) to destroy nigral dopamine cells selectively by
inhibiting complex I of the mitochondrial energy chain may provide a clue.
Indeed, recent studies of post-mortem brain tissue have suggested the presence of
an on-going toxic process in the substantia nigra in Parkinson's disease leading 
to excess lipid peroxidation. This appears also to involve a disruption of
mitochondrial function since mitochondrial superoxide dismutase activity is
increased and there is impairment of complex I. These changes may in turn relate 
to a selective increase in the total iron content of substantia nigra coupled to 
a generalised decrease in brain ferritin content. Piribedil is used in the
symptomatic treatment of Parkinson's disease and is particularly effective
against tremor. Piribedil (and its metabolites) acts as a dopamine D-2 receptor
agonist. However, in our studies in contrast to other dopamine agonists, in vivo 
piribedil interacts with dopamine receptors in the substantia nigra and nucleus
accumbens but not those in the striatum. In patients with Parkinson's disease the
beneficial effects of piribedil may be limited by nausea and drowsiness. Indeed, 
in MPTP-treated primates piribedil reverses motor deficits but marked
side-effects occur. However, pre-treatment with the peripheral dopamine receptor 
antagonist domperidone prevents the unwanted effects and piribedil produces a
profound and longer-lasting reversal of all components of the motor
syndrome.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Synergism of NBQX with dopamine agonists in the 6-OHDA rat model of Parkinson's
disease.

Advance in understanding of the anatomy, physiology and pharmacology of basal
ganglia organisation over the past decade revealed a functional relation between 
excitatory glutamatergic and the degenerated dopaminergic nigrostriatal
transmitter systems which could serve as targets for pharmacological
interventions in Parkinson's disease. The selective AMPA-antagonist NBQX is not
effective in animal models of Parkinson's disease when given alone but
ameliorates parkinsonian symptomatology and enhances the locomotor response of a 
threshold dose of L-DOPA. These synergistic effects are seen in the MPTP-treated 
(1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) common marmoset and the rat with
unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesions of the substantia nigra. Here we
report that, in the latter model, such synergism of NBQX is also seen with the
direct dopamine agonists lisuride and apomorphine, indicating the potential
usefulness of AMPA antagonists for the symptomatic treatment of Parkinson's
disease.

Protracted long-term treatment of common marmosets with 15 doses (0.5-4.5 mg/kg, 
i.p.) of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP; total dose 25 mg/kg,
given over 29 days) caused transitory changes in motor behaviour reminiscent of
human Parkinson's disease. 16 days from the start of MPTP administration, all
animals showed motor impairment, consisting of profound akinesia and a rigid
posture, but in no case resting tremor. Biogenic amines were measured in
nigrostriatal regions one month after finishing MPTP treatment. There was a
profound loss of dopamine and serotonin in the substantia nigra and in the
striatum; noradrenaline was only reduced in the putamen. Continuous analyses of
the concentrations of biogenic amine metabolites in the CSF during this study
revealed persistent dopaminergic disturbances and temporary alterations in
serotoninergic and noradrenergic function.

Degeneration of dopaminergic nigrostriatal neurons in Parkinson's disease results
in an overactivity of excitatory glutamatergic projections from the subthalamic
nucleus to the output nuclei of the basal ganglia resulting in rigidity and
akinesia. In theory pharmacological blockade of these overactive systems should
improve parkinsonian symptomatology. The selective AMPA-antagonist NBQX and the
competitive NMDA-antagonist CPP are not effective in animal models of Parkinson's
disease when given alone but ameliorate parkinsonian symptomatology and stimulate
locomotor activity when co-administered with a threshold dose of L-Dopa. These
synergistic effects are seen in the MPTP-treated
(1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) common marmoset and the rat with
unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesions of the substantia nigra. Therefore 
competitive NMDA and non-NMDA antagonists may offer a new therapeutic strategy
for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.

The study of subtle changes in motor and cognitive function after exposure to
MPTP might serve as a guide to the very earliest stages of Parkinson's disease.
Studies in nonhuman primates and man exposed to MPTP who remained asymptomatic or
recovered completely are reviewed. The question of the relationship between the
degree and extent of damage to the nigrostriatal dopamine system and changes in
motor and cognitive (behavioral) function is addressed. What guidance they
provide in the study of subclinical or preclinical Parkinson's disease is
discussed.

These studies characterise the pharmacology of ropinirole, a selective D-2
agonist. High-affinity human caudate binding revealed a Ki for D2 receptors of
2.9 x 10(-8) M with no affinity for D1 at 10(-4) M in the rat. Ropinirole was
weakly active at alpha 2-adrenoceptors and 5-HT2 receptors but inactive at 5-HT1,
benzodiazepine and gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors or alpha 1 and
beta-adrenoceptors. In rodents, ropinirole, like apomorphine, caused biphasic
spontaneous locomotor activity and contralateral circling in 6-OHDA-lesioned mice
with no tolerance to the latter after 14 days treatment. Amphetamine caused
ipsilateral responses in the lesioned mice. Ropinirole did not cause marked
stereotypies. In marmosets ropinirole (0.05-1.0 mg/kg SC or 0.1 mg/kg PO)
reversed all motor and behavioural deficits induced by MPTP. This response
started 10-20 minutes after dosing, and exceeded 2 hours. No tolerance was seen
following chronic b.i.d. treatment. Similar results were obtained with 1-dopa
plus benserazide; however, 1-dopa always caused emesis, whereas beneficial
effects were shown with ropinirole in the absence of this side effect. These
results support the continued clinical assessment of ropinirole for the treatment
of Parkinson's disease.

Alleviation of parkinsonism by antagonism of excitatory amino acid transmission
in the medial segment of the globus pallidus in rat and primate.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Cell and Structural Biology, University of Manchester, England.

Recent experimental data has made possible the description of the
pathophysiological circuitry that mediates parkinsonism. This work has shown that
dopamine-denervated striatal cells discharge abnormally and that this ultimately 
causes cells in the medial segment of the globus pallidus to become abnormally
overactive. The main driving force behind the overactive cells in the medial
pallidal segment appears to be excess activity in the afferent pathway to it from
the subthalamic nucleus. This pathway is known to use an excitatory amino acid
(EAA) as its transmitter. It was therefore hypothesized that local blockade of
EAA transmission in the medial segment of the globus pallidus should reverse
parkinsonism. This hypothesis was tested in rat and primate models of
parkinsonism by the direct injection of the EAA antagonist, kynurenic acid, into 
the medial segment of the globus pallidus. The results demonstrate that this
procedure can reverse parkinsonism in a dose-dependent manner, and suggest that
manipulation of EAA transmission in the medial segment of the globus pallidus may
have therapeutic potential for treating parkinsonism.

An outbreak of hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection occurred among cancer patients
treated with interleukin-2 (IL-2) and lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells
between July and September 1986 at six different clinical centers. Among 85
patients tested serologically for recent HAV infection, 22 (39%) of 56
susceptible patients developed acute HAV infection. Only exposure to LAK cells
cultured in medium containing human serum from two specific manufactured pools
was associated with HAV infection. Attack rates were 85% among patients exposed
to pool X, 62% in patients exposed to pool Y, and 50% in those exposed to both
pools, compared with none among the 24 susceptible persons exposed to other serum
pools (P less than .001). The serum used in production of LAK cell medium was
obtained from multiple paid donors. Twenty persons donated plasma to both serum
pools X and Y. Although none of 12 donors tested had evidence of recent HAV
infection, it is likely that an asymptomatic plasma donor viremic for HAV
contaminated both serum pools and the LAK cell medium made from it.

The present study was performed to determine the effect of a nearly complete
nigrostriatal dopaminergic denervation on DARPP-32 levels in the striatum from
animals and parkinsonian patients. DARPP-32 levels were estimated by in vitro
phosphorylation in the presence of cAMP, or after inactivation of endogenous
kinases and phosphatases, in the presence of the catalytic subunit of
cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Intranigral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) infusion in
rats, or peripheral administration of the neurotoxin
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) to common marmosets, did not 
change striatal DARPP-32 levels. Postmortem studies, carried out on brains
obtained shortly after death, from patients with Parkinson disease, or from
patients with progressive supranuclear palsy, showed that the levels of striatal 
DARPP-32 were not different from controls. These results indicate that
dopaminergic striatal denervation did not modify the amount of DARPP-32 in the
striatum, suggesting that the expression of DARPP-32, a protein which mediates
some of the effects of dopamine in striatal neurons, is independent from the
dopaminergic innervation.

A modified primate model of Parkinson's disease was developed to assess the
effectiveness of various agents that act via dopamine, acetylcholine, serotonin
or glutamate systems. Using a MPTP dosing regimen a reversible parkinsonian-like 
syndrome was produced in the marmoset. An obvious advantage of such a protocol is
that it allows multiple drug studies to be undertaken in animals, without the
need for prolonged anti-parkinsonian therapy to maintain their health. Results
show that dopamine D2 agonists (bromocriptine, quinpirole,
N,N-dipropyl,A,5,6-DTN, (+)3PPP and PHNO), anti-muscarinics (atropine,
scopolamine and benztropine), in addition to L-DOPA and nomifensine, all reduced 
the bradykinesia induced by MPTP. The D1 agonist SKF-38393 and the partial
dopamine agonist (-)3PPP were both ineffective. Finally, agents with potential
therapeutic use in Parkinson's disease were also tested. However, a glutamate
antagonist (MK801) and three serotonin antagonists (ritanserin, ketanserin and
ICI 170,809) were all unable to alter the MPTP effects, at the doses used in our 
study.

Acute treatment of common marmosets with
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) caused an initial profound
akinesia and other motor deficits. However, over the following months akinesia
gradually disappeared although the animals remained clumsy and poorly
coordinated. At 10 days following MPTP treatment there was a profound decrease in
the dopamine, HVA and DOPAC content of the caudate nucleus, putamen and nucleus
accumbens. By 3-4 months following MPTP treatment the animals had largely
recovered from their akinesia, but the caudate nucleus and putamen dopamine, HVA 
and DOPAC content remained low. In contrast, the dopamine content of the nucleus 
accumbens had returned towards normal and the metabolite levels were higher than 
at 10 days. No overall alterations in 5HT or 5HIAA levels were observed at either
time point. The transient and reversible nature of dopamine loss in the nucleus
accumbens may contribute to the initial profound akinesia exhibited by common
marmosets treated with MPTP. The restoration of dopamine levels in the nucleus
accumbens may be partially responsible for the subsequent recovery of motor
function that occurs in MPTP-treated marmosets.

Administration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) to common
marmosets induced motor deficits, associated with a marked decrease in the uptake
of [3H]dopamine into synaptosomes in the putamen and a reduction in the content
of dopamine in both caudate nucleus and nucleus accumbens. Histological analysis 
showed a marked loss of dopamine-containing cells in the zona compacta of the
substantia nigra and less loss in the ventral tegmental area. Treatment of
animals with the selective monoamine oxidase (MAO) B inhibitor, MDL 72145 (0.5 or
2.0 mg/kg) prior to, during and following administration of MPTP partially
protected animals from the motor abnormalities induced by administration of MPTP 
alone. Both doses inhibited the onset of akinesia but only the large dose of MDL 
72145 prevented the occurrence of other motor abnormalities. Moreover, while MDL 
72145 (2.0 mg/kg) prevented the loss in uptake of [3H]dopamine into synaptosomes 
of the putamen, this was only partly prevented using the smaller dose. Similarly,
while MDL 72145 (2.0 mg/kg) prevented loss of dopamine in the caudate, only
partial protection was afforded by the smaller dose. However, in the nucleus
accumbens, both doses of MDL 72145 prevented the depletion of dopamine, occurring
in this region. Histological examination of the substantia nigra showed little or
no cell loss in animals receiving the larger dose of MDL 72145 but a moderate
cell loss in animals receiving the smaller dose. No damage was observed in the
ventral tegmental area of animals treated with MDL 72145 (2.0 mg/kg) and only
mild cell loss in those receiving the smaller dose.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250

Further treatment with MPTP does not produce parkinsonism in marmosets showing
behavioural recovery from motor deficits induced by an earlier exposure to the
toxin.

1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), or 0.9% saline, was
administered to a group of common marmosets initially treated with the toxin
12-18 months previously. Initial treatment had consisted of a cumulative dose of 
6-22 mg/kg (i.p.) which caused marked parkinsonism. Subsequently, the animals
gradually recovered normal motor function. Further treatment consisted of a
cumulative dose of MPTP of 78-83 mg/kg (i.p.) but this produced only modest
akinesia. At 12-18 months after the initial treatment with MPTP, the content of
dopamine, HVA and DOPAC in the caudate and putamen was markedly reduced. However,
levels of dopamine, HVA and DOPAC in the nucleus accumbens were normal. Three
months after the second treatment with MPTP there was no further decrease in the 
content of dopamine in the caudate-putamen. However, in the nucleus accumbens the
content of dopamine, HVA and DOPAC was now reduced. The initial treatment with
MPTP substantially decreased the binding of [3H]mazindol in the caudate-putamen
but less so in the nucleus accumbens. Only a small additional decrease occurred
upon further treatment with MPTP. The density of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)
immunoreactive cells in substantia nigra was reduced after the initial treatment 
with MPTP. However, the cell loss was far less marked than the decrease in
terminal density, assessed by the binding of [3H]mazindol. Subsequent treatment
with MPTP caused a small further loss of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive cells.
Initial treatment with MPTP may kill the majority of MPTP-sensitive dopamine
cells in the nigra. Compensation by the remaining nigrostriatal neurones may
account for the behavioural recovery observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Stereoselective reversal of MPTP-induced parkinsonism in the marmoset after
dermal application of N-0437.

The selective dopamine D-2 receptor agonist N-0437 produced a rapid and
dose-dependent reversal of motor deficits lasting 90-120 min following i.p. or
oral administration of the racemate to MPTP-treated common marmosets. In
contrast, topical application of (+/-)-, (+)- or (-)-N-0437 to the skin of
MPTP-treated animals did not alter locomotor activity in the initial 4 h although
other motor disabilities were reduced. However, 24 h following application of the
racemate or the (-) enantiomer both locomotor activity and the other motor
deficits induced by MPTP were improved. The increase in locomotor activity
returned to basal values by 48-52 h following application of the racemate to the 
skin and by 72-76 h following administration of (-)-N-0437; the other motor
deficits induced by MPTP were reduced for up to 72-76 h by both (+/-)- and
(-)-N-0437. Application to skin of the (+) enantiomer produced no behavioural
improvement or stimulation of locomotor activity. Transdermal administration of
the active enantiomer of N-0437 may be of value in producing a prolonged reversal
of parkinsonian motor deficits in man.

Increased caudate dopamine turnover may contribute to the recovery of motor
function in marmosets treated with the dopaminergic neurotoxin MPTP.

Neurology, Institute of Psychiatry, London, U.K.

Administration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) to common
marmosets initially impaired motor function, but a partial recovery occurred over
the following weeks. At both 10 days and 4-6 weeks following MPTP treatment,
[3H]dopamine ([3H]DA) uptake into synaptosomal preparations of putamen was
markedly decreased. At 10 days and 4-6 weeks following MPTP treatment DA,
homovanillic acid (HVA) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) levels in the 
caudate nucleus and nucleus accumbens were substantially reduced. However, the
levels of HVA and DOPAC in caudate nucleus were higher at 4-6 weeks than at 10
days. The ratio of (DOPAC + HVA)/DA in caudate nucleus was elevated at 10 days
following MPTP treatment and even more so at 4-6 weeks. No change in Bmax or Kd
values for [3H]spiperone binding to caudate preparations were observed. The
recovery of motor function in marmosets observed following MPTP treatment may
result partially from a compensatory increase in caudate DA turnover by remaining
neurones.

Antiparkinsonian activity of CY 208-243, a partial D-1 dopamine receptor agonist,
in MPTP-treated marmosets and patients with Parkinson's disease.

The effect of stimulation of cerebral dopamine D-1 receptors by CY 208-243 on
motor disability was tested in MPTP-treated parkinsonian marmosets and patients
with Parkinson's disease. CY 208-243 (0.5-1.25 mg/kg s.c.) produced a
dose-related reversal of akinesia and rigidity in the marmosets, lasting some 2
h. Single morning doses of CY 208-243 (5-40 mg) were compared with the usual
morning dose of levodopa in eight patients with Parkinson's disease on long-term 
levodopa therapy who had developed motor fluctuations from immobility with
akinesia and rigidity (off) to mobility often with dyskinesias (on). CY 208-243
alone was capable of switching such patients from off to on; five of the eight
patients responded to the highest dose (40 mg), sometimes with dyskinesias. The
response to CY 208-243 was comparable to that produced by levodopa in these
cases. Drugs designed to stimulate both dopamine D1 and D2 receptors in the brain
may improve the therapy of Parkinson's disease.

Vale, London.

Six young adult marmosets received 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine
in multiple doses (total 8-16 mg/kg over 2-13 days) sufficient to produce a
parkinsonian syndrome and were killed up to 3.5 months later. Cellular changes
were found in the substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area, and hypothalamus. The
earliest histological abnormalities were axonal swellings in proximal parts of
nigrostriatal axons. Subsequent changes in the substantia nigra were reduced
Nissl staining, reduced cell volume, and aggregation and loss of melanin
granules. Other effects were reduced nuclear and nucleolar volumes, depletion of 
cells, and hyperplasia of glial cells. Shrunken cytoplasm and nuclei stained
uniformly with eosin, and no cells showed cytoplasmic swellings or inclusions.
These cellular alterations, with nuclear changes resembling karyolysis, do not
occur in Parkinson's disease, which is characterised by Lewy body inclusions and 
signs of chromatolysis. The rapid appearance of axonal swellings, disruption of
Nissl substance, and cell shrinkage suggest an insult to energy producing
mechanisms. In this study, the absence of histological evidence of toxicity in
the locus coeruleus and also in the substantia innominata and in serotonergic
cell groups is unlike the more widespread degenerative changes of Parkinson's
disease.

Administration of L-DOPA plus carbidopa, or the D-2 agonist (+)-PHNO, to
MPTP-treated common marmosets caused motor hyperactivity and a reversal of the
parkinsonian syndrome. In contrast, administration of the putative D-1 agonist
SKF 38393 was without effect on movement or motor disability. The subsequent
administration of another putative selective D-1 partial agonist CY 208-243
produced a dose-related improvement in motor activity and reversal of
parkinsonian motor deficits in MPTP-treated animals. The effect of CY 208-243 was
inhibited by pretreatment with the D-1 antagonist SCH 23390 and, to a lesser
extent, by the D-2 antagonist sulpiride. In another group of normal drug naive
marmosets, the administration of CY 208-243 produced only a small increase in
motor activity. Following treatment with MPTP and without other drug
administration, administration of CY 208-243 produced a marked reversal of motor 
deficits and locomotor hyperactivity. Thus, CY 208-243, suggested to be a partial
D-1 agonist exhibits antiparkinsonian activity in MPTP-treated marmosets which
does not require prior or concurrent exposure to D-2 agonists.

Migration of tetrahydroisoquinoline, a possible parkinsonian neurotoxin, into

1,2,3,4-Tetrahydroisoquinoline (TIQ) was quantitated by use of gas
chromatography-mass spectrometry in brains and livers of marmosets which showed
parkinsonism after daily subcutaneous injection of TIQ. TIQ showed greatly
increased levels in the brains and livers of the TIQ-treated marmosets, with no
detectable metabolites of TIQ. TIQ was present as an endogenous amine in the
brains and livers of saline-treated marmosets at very low concentrations. It thus
seems that TIQ can pass easily through the blood-brain barrier but cannot be
metabolized in the brain or the liver. It is possible that TIQ accumulated in the
brain may produce parkinsonism.

An endogenous substance of the brain, tetrahydroisoquinoline, produces
parkinsonism in primates with decreased dopamine, tyrosine hydroxylase and
biopterin in the nigrostriatal regions.

Nagatsu T(1), Yoshida M.

An endogenous substance of the human brain, tetrahydroisoquinoline (TIQ), that
had been increased in the parkinsonian brain, produced parkinsonism in marmosets 
after daily injection of TIQ (50 mg/kg per day, s.c. for 11 days). Tyrosine
hydroxylase activity, total biopterin and dopamine concentrations were also
decreased in TIQ-treated marmosets. The results suggest that TIQ is one of the
candidates of neurotoxins to produce parkinsonism.

Administration of the drug 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine induces a
parkinsonian syndrome in primates. Intraperitoneal injections of
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine in the common marmoset (Callithrix
jacchus) produced symptoms of rigidity, akinesia and tremor which persisted for
at least one month. However, after this time, considerable behavioural recovery
occurred, although animals were still severely bradykinetic compared with
controls. Marmosets were allowed to survive for 1, 3 1/2 or 7 months prior to
histological and immunocytochemical analysis. Detection of catecholaminergic
neurons using antibodies directed against the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase
revealed a profound (80%) loss of dopaminergic cells from the substantia nigra
one month after initiation of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine
treatment. This was accompanied by a severe gliosis. Fewer cells were lost from
the adjacent ventral tegmental area (45%), but dopamine-containing cells in other
brain areas were not obviously affected. At longer survival times the substantia 
nigra was less damaged, with a proliferation of glia in the pars compacta and a
loss of approximately 20% of the dopaminergic perikarya. Using
immunohistochemical techniques, the distribution of neuropeptides substance P,
[Met]enkephalin and dynorphin 1-17-like immunoreactivity were examined and found 
to exhibit distinctive patterns in the marmoset substantia nigra. The integrity
of these systems appeared intact at all times after
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine treatment. These results support the
hypothesis that the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine
produces a clinical syndrome, indistinguishable from Parkinson's disease, via a
selective destruction only of neurons with perikarya in the substantia nigra pars
compacta and the ventral tegmental area. The findings that the peptidergic input 
to these cells together with most non-nigral dopaminergic cell groups are not
damaged, indicate that the selectivity of the lesion produced by
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine appears greater than that seen in
idiopathic Parkinson's disease. The neurotoxic effects of
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine in the marmoset may not be permanent
since both behavioural and biochemical recovery were observed after several
months.

4-phenylpyridine and three other analogues of

neurotoxicity in mice and marmosets.

Perry TL, Jones K, Hansen S, Wall RA.

C57 black mice were injected repeatedly with maximal tolerated doses of 2
chemical analogues of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP);
4-phenylpyridine and 4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine. Although both compounds
were clearly acutely toxic to mice, neither caused any reduction in striatal
dopamine content after chronic exposure. Two MPTP analogues which may be formed
endogenously during the metabolism of brain monoamines,
2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline and
2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-beta-carboline, were injected repeatedly into common 
marmosets. Again, although both compounds appeared highly toxic, neither caused
any reduction in striatal dopamine content. It appears unlikely that any of these
4 MPTP analogues causes idiopathic Parkinson's disease.

1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) administration causes a
Parkinson's disease like syndrome in man and primates, with selective
degeneration of the substantia nigra. This discovery has raised the possibility
that some environmental or endogenous toxin causes idiopathic Parkinson's
disease. MPTP is oxidised to its neurotoxic metabolite,
1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) by monoamine oxidase B (MAO B). MPTP toxicity 
is prevented by pretreatment with the MAO B inhibitor selegiline ((-)-deprenyl). 
We have screened a range of structural analogues of MPTP as possible alternative 
substrates for the enzyme. All compounds which were found to be substrates for
MAO B were tetrahydropyridines, some with substituents on the phenyl ring. The
most interesting substrate, ethyl-MTP-carboxylate, did not have a phenyl ring.
The precise histochemical localisation of MAO B within the rat and marmoset brain
has been established. There was substantial activity within the nigrostriatal
pathway of the marmoset; in comparison, the rat had only a low background MAO B
level. These results may partially explain why the marmoset is more susceptible
to the action of MPTP than the rat.

Administration of MPTP (1-4 mg/kg ip daily for 5-7 days) to common marmosets
induced persistent parkinsonian motor deficits. The subcutaneous administration
of (+)-PHNO [(+)-4-propyl-9-hydroxynaphthoxazine; 1-4 micrograms/kg] caused a
dose-dependent reversal of the akinesia and incoordination of movement.
Similarly, oral administration of (+)-PHNO (5-20 micrograms/kg) caused an
equivalent reversal of the motor abnormalities. No dyskinetic phenomena were
induced by (+)-PHNO on oral or subcutaneous administration. Oral or subcutaneous 
administration of (+)-PHNO to normal control marmosets also increased the usual
repetoire of motor behaviour, but this was not as marked as in MPTP-treated
animals. (+)-PHNO is a potent dopamine agonist drug of potential use in the
treatment of Parkinson's disease.

The dopamine neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)
produces histological lesions in the hypothalamus of the common marmoset.

Gibb WR, Lees AJ, Jenner P, Marsden CD.

The administration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) to
marmosets resulted in parkinsonism and degeneration of the substantia nigra pars 
compacta. Examination of the hypothalamus showed neuronophagic-like rosettes of
glial cells and diffuse increase in glial numbers in areas of the dopaminergic
A11-A14 groups. These findings suggest that MPTP may be toxic to dopamine neurons
of the hypothalamus as well as to the substantia nigra.

Neuropeptides and dopamine in the marmoset. Effect of treatment with
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2, 3, 6 tetrahydropyridine (MPTP): an animal model for
Parkinson's disease?

Allen JM, Cross AJ, Yeats JC, Ghatei MA, McGregor GP, Close SP, Pay S, Marriott
AS, Tyers MB, Crow TJ, et al.

Neurochemical studies of post-mortem human parkinsonian brains have demonstrated 
specific alterations in neuropeptide concentrations within the substantia nigra
and striatal structures. The drug, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2, 3, 6
tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) has been reported to act as a selective toxin to
nigrostriatal dopamine neurons, and induces a parkinsonian-like syndrome in
primates. In this study, marmosets developed features typical of Parkinson's
disease following treatment with MPTP for four days. The effects of MPTP
treatment on the concentrations of dopamine and neuropeptides were determined and
changes compared with those reported for Parkinson's disease. It was found that
within the substantia nigra, substance P concentrations doubled following
treatment with MPTP; in contrast, concentrations of vasoactive intestinal peptide
and neuropeptide Y were significantly reduced. No changes were observed in the
concentrations of six other neuropeptides measured in this region, notably
cholecystokinin. Despite marked depletion of dopamine within the caudate nucleus 
and putamen, concentrations of all neuropeptides within these structures remained
unchanged with the exception of an isolated reduction of neuropeptide Y within
the putamen. Somatostatin concentrations within the frontal cortex and
hippocampus were significantly elevated in the marmosets treated with MPTP. These
neuropeptide changes in the CNS contrast with those reported for Parkinson's
disease. In view of the autonomic dysfunction associated with Parkinson's
disease, peripheral concentrations of neuropeptides were determined. Significant 
depletion of neuropeptide Y was identified in the ureter, adrenal and
cardiovascular tissue. Thus the neurochemical changes induced by MPTP may not be 
as selective as previously reported.

The administration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) to
common marmosets induced persistent motor deficits and decreased concentrations
of dopamine, homovanillic acid, and 3,4-dihydroxy-phenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and
[3H]dopamine uptake in the caudate-putamen. There was an 80% reduction in
tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactive cells in substantia nigra. At 10 days
following the start of MPTP administration, the activity of choline
acetyltransferase in the thalamus and frontal cortex was unchanged compared with 
control animals. Similarly, specific [3H]QNB binding was unaltered. At 4-6 weeks 
following the start of MPTP treatment, choline acetyltransferase activity and
[3H]QNB binding in the frontal cortex and thalamus remained unaffected. There was
no evidence for cell loss in the nucleus basalis of Meynert or alteration in the 
intensity of staining for acetylcholinesterase. MPTP treatment of the common
marmoset produces a nigrostriatal lesion. In contrast, MPTP did not alter
cortical cholinergic function and was not neurotoxic to the cholinergic cells in 
the nucleus basalis of Meynert.

The actions of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine in animals as a model
of Parkinson's disease.

Jenner P, Marsden CD.

The ability of MPTP to induce persistent parkinsonism in man may provide a vital 
clue to the cause of the idiopathic disease. However, the peripheral
administration of MPTP to rodent species only produces losses in brain dopamine
content and damage to the nigrostriatal system in high doses and no persistent
motor deficits have been observed. In contrast, in primates, the administration
of MPTP rapidly induces a persistent parkinsonian syndrome accompanied by
evidence for selective damage to the nigro-striatal dopamine containing system.
Other neurotransmitter systems appear unaffected by MPTP treatment. The
MPTP-treated primate responds to the administration of L-DOPA and other
antiparkinsonian drugs and may provide a useful test-bed for the development of
novel antiparkinsonian medication. Administration of MPTP to primates causes an
accumulation of MPP+ in a variety of brain areas. The accumulation of MPP+ and
the neurotoxic actions of MPTP in primates can be prevented by the prior
administration of monoamine oxidase inhibitors. The ability of monoamine oxidase 
inhibitors to prevent MPTP toxicity is related to the metabolism of MPTP by
monoamine oxidase B, probably extraneuronally in glia, to produce MPDP+ and
subsequently MPP+. In rodent synaptosomal preparations MPP+ is a substrate for
the dopamine uptake mechanism and so would be selectively accumulated in brain
dopamine neurones. Administration of MPTP to animals results in the production of
a partial model of idiopathic Parkinson's disease as it occurs in man. MPTP
treatment produces the major symptoms of Parkinson's disease in primates but the 
pathology is limited to the nigro-striatal system, whereas in Parkinson's disease
pathology is more widespread. Biochemical changes induced by MPTP again seem
primarily limited to those induced by damage to the nigro-striatal dopamine
containing system. MPP+ (or another metabolite of MPTP) may be responsible for
the neurotoxicity of MPTP but not all neurones which accumulate products of MPTP 
metabolism are damaged. The nigro-striatal system may be peculiarly sensitive to 
the effects of MPTP.

Acute administration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine affects the 
adrenal glands as well as the brain in the marmoset.

Fine A, Reynolds GP, Nakajima N, Jenner P, Marsden CD.

A parkinsonian syndrome was induced in marmosets by administration of
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) for 4 days. Ten days
following the onset of drug administration, brainstem and adrenal tissues were
assayed for levels of monoamines and their metabolites. In the brainstem
tegmentum, dopamine, its metabolites homovanillic acid (HVA) and
dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), and noradrenaline were reduced, whereas
5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) levels were elevated, in comparison with untreated
controls. In the adrenal gland, 5-HT and adrenaline levels were unchanged, but
dopamine and noradrenaline were substantially elevated.

The dopamine D2 agonist LY 141865, but not the D1 agonist SKF 38393, reverses
parkinsonism induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) in
the common marmoset.

Nomoto M, Jenner P, Marsden CD.

Marmosets treated with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) (1-4
mg/kg i.p. daily for up to 8 days) develop profound parkinsonian akinesia.
Administration of the D1 agonist SKF 38393 (1-20 mg/kg i.p.) 4-6 weeks later had 
no effect on the motor activity of animals pretreated with MPTP. In contrast, the
administration of the D2 agonist LY 141865 (0.1 or 0.5 mg/kg i.p.) caused a
marked increase in motor activity lasting for up to 2 h. We conclude that
stimulation of D2 dopamine receptors is essential for motor activation of
parkinsonian marmosets and that D1 stimulation alone is not sufficient to
overcome the akinesia induced by MPTP treatment.

Failure of SKF 38393-A to relieve parkinsonian symptoms induced by
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine in the marmoset.

Close SP, Marriott AS, Pay S.

Chronic administration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)
induced parkinsonian symptoms, predominantly bradykinesia and tremor, in
marmosets. These symptoms were reduced by L-DOPA plus benserazide but the
putative D1-receptor agonist SKF 38393-A did not affect tremor and increased the 
bradykinesia. Neither treatment affected behaviour in normal marmosets. It is
suggested that D1-receptor agonists are unlikely to be effective in the treatment
of Parkinson's disease.

1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-induced parkinsonism in the common
marmoset.

Jenner P, Rupniak NM, Rose S, Kelly E, Kilpatrick G, Lees A, Marsden CD.

The administration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) (1-4
mg/kg i.p.) for 4 days induced dose-dependent parkinsonism in the common marmoset
within 48 h. MPTP produced profound akinesia, rigidity of the trunk and limbs,
postural abnormalities, loss of vocalization and, in some cases, postural tremor.
In a single animal the administration of L-DOPA in conjunction with a peripheral 
decarboxylase inhibitor, reversed the parkinsonian symptoms. Subsequent
biochemical analysis showed a profound loss of dopamine and [3H]dopamine uptake
in the caudate-putamen, but no change in specific [3H]spiperone binding.
